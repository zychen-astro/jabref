  abstract      = {We set out to quantify the number density of quiescent massive compact galaxies at intermediate redshifts. We determine structural parameters based on I-band imaging using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) equatorial Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 (CS82) survey ({\tilde}170 deg$^{2}$) taking advantage of an exquisite median seeing of {\tilde}0.6 arcsec. We select compact massive (M$_{⋆}$ $\gt$ 5 {\times} 10$^{10}$ M$_{⊙}$) galaxies within the redshift range of 0.2 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 0.6. The large volume sampled allows to decrease the effect of cosmic variance that has hampered the calculation of the number density for this enigmatic population in many previous studies. We undertake an exhaustive analysis in an effort to untangle the various findings inherent to the diverse definition of compactness present in the literature. We find that the absolute number of compact galaxies is very dependent on the adopted definition and can change up to a factor of $\gt$10. We systematically measure a factor of {\tilde}5 more compacts at the same redshift than what was previously reported on smaller fields with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, which are more affected by cosmic variance. This means that the decrease in number density from z {\tilde} 1.5 to z {\tilde} 0.2 might be only of a factor of {\tilde}2-5, significantly smaller than what was previously reported. This supports progenitor bias as the main contributor to the size evolution. This milder decrease is roughly compatible with the predictions from recent numerical simulations. Only the most extreme compact galaxies, with R$_{eff}$ $\lt$ 1.5 {\times} (M$_{⋆}$/10$^{11}$ M$_{⊙}$)$^{0.75}$ and M$_{⋆}$ $\gt$ 10$^{10.7}$ M$_{⊙}$, appear to drop in number by a factor of {\tilde}20 and hence likely experience a noticeable size evolution.},

  title       = {The Fourteenth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: First Spectroscopic Data from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey and from the second phase of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment},
  abstract    = {The fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) has been in operation since July 2014. This paper describes the second data release from this phase, and the fourteenth from SDSS overall (making this, Data Release Fourteen or DR14). This release makes public data taken by SDSS-IV in its first two years of operation (July 2014-2016). Like all previous SDSS releases, DR14 is cumulative, including the most recent reductions and calibrations of all data taken by SDSS since the first phase began operations in 2000. New in DR14 is the first public release of data from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS); the first data from the second phase of the Apache Point Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-2), including stellar parameter estimates from an innovative data driven machine learning algorithm known as "The Cannon"; and almost twice as many data cubes from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey as were in the previous release (N = 2812 in total). This paper describes the location and format of the publicly available data from SDSS-IV surveys. We provide references to the important technical papers describing how these data have been taken (both targeting and observation details) and processed for scientific use. The SDSS website (www.sdss.org) has been updated for this release, and provides links to data downloads, as well as tutorials and examples of data use. SDSS-IV is planning to continue to collect astronomical data until 2020, and will be followed by SDSS-V.},

  title       = {The Eleventh and Twelfth Data Releases of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: Final Data from SDSS-III},
  abstract    = {The third generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III) took data from 2008 to 2014 using the original SDSS wide-field imager, the original and an upgraded multi-object fiber-fed optical spectrograph, a new near-infrared high-resolution spectrograph, and a novel optical interferometer. All the data from SDSS-III are now made public. In particular, this paper describes Data Release 11 (DR11) including all data acquired through 2013 July, and Data Release 12 (DR12) adding data acquired through 2014 July (including all data included in previous data releases), marking the end of SDSS-III observing. Relative to our previous public release (DR10), DR12 adds one million new spectra of galaxies and quasars from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) over an additional 3000 sq. deg of sky, more than triples the number of H-band spectra of stars as part of the Apache Point Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), and includes repeated accurate radial velocity measurements of 5500 stars from the Multi-Object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanet Large-area Survey (MARVELS). The APOGEE outputs now include measured abundances of 15 different elements for each star. In total, SDSS-III added 2350 sq. deg of ugriz imaging; 155,520 spectra of 138,099 stars as part of the Sloan Exploration of Galactic Understanding and Evolution 2 (SEGUE-2) survey; 2,497,484 BOSS spectra of 1,372,737 galaxies, 294,512 quasars, and 247,216 stars over 9376 sq. deg; 618,080 APOGEE spectra of 156,593 stars; and 197,040 MARVELS spectra of 5,513 stars. Since its first light in 1998, SDSS has imaged over 1/3 of the Celestial sphere in five bands and obtained over five million astronomical spectra.},

Using 11,275 galaxies complete to r * = 17.6 over 140 deg 2 , we compute the luminosity function of galaxies in the r * band over a range -23 < M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/121/5/2358/img1.gif] < -16 (for h = 1). The result is well-described by a Schechter function with parameters ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/phi.gif] {phi} * = (1.46 ± 0.12) × 10 -2 h 3 Mpc -3 , M * = -20.83 ± 0.03, and α = -1.20 ± 0.03. The implied luminosity density in r * is j ≈ (2.6 ± 0.3) × 10 8 h L ⊙ Mpc -3 . We find that the surface brightness selection threshold has a negligible impact for M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/121/5/2358/img1.gif] < -18. Using subsets of the data, we measure the luminosity function in the u *, g *, i *, and z * bands as well; the slope at low luminosities ranges from α = -1.35 to α = -1.2. We measure the bivariate distribution of r * luminosity with half-light surface brightness, intrinsic g *- r * color, and morphology. In agreement with previous studies, we find that high surface brightness, red, highly concentrated galaxies are on average more luminous than low surface brightness, blue, less concentrated galaxies. An important feature of the SDSS luminosity function is the use of Petrosian magnitudes, which measure a constant fraction of a galaxy's total light regardless of the amplitude of its surface brightness profile. If we synthesize results for R GKC band or b j band using these Petrosian magnitudes, we obtain luminosity densities 2 times that found by the Las Campanas Redshift Survey in R GKC and 1.4 times that found by the Two Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey in b j . However, we are able to reproduce the luminosity functions obtained by these surveys if we also mimic their isophotal limits for defining galaxy magnitudes, which are shallower and more redshift dependent than the Petrosian magnitudes used by the SDSS.},

  abstract = {We present an overview of a new integral field spectroscopic survey called MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory), one of three core programs in the fourth-generation Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) that began on 2014 July 1. MaNGA will investigate the internal kinematic structure and composition of gas and stars in an unprecedented sample of 10,000 nearby galaxies. We summarize essential characteristics of the instrument and survey design in the context of MaNGA's key science goals and present prototype observations to demonstrate MaNGA's scientific potential. MaNGA employs dithered observations with 17 fiber-bundle integral field units that vary in diameter from 12'' (19 fibers) to 32'' (127 fibers). Two dual-channel spectrographs provide simultaneous wavelength coverage over 3600-10300 Å at R ~ 2000. With a typical integration time of 3 hr, MaNGA reaches a target r -band signal-to-noise ratio of 4-8 (Å –1 per 2'' fiber) at 23 AB mag arcsec –2 , which is typical for the outskirts of MaNGA galaxies. Targets are selected with M * ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 10 9 M ☉ using SDSS-I redshifts and i -band luminosity to achieve uniform radial coverage in terms of the effective radius, an approximately flat distribution in stellar mass, and a sample spanning a wide range of environments. Analysis of our prototype observations demonstrates MaNGA's ability to probe gas ionization, shed light on recent star formation and quenching, enable dynamical modeling, decompose constituent components, and map the composition of stellar populations. MaNGA's spatially resolved spectra will enable an unprecedented study of the astrophysics of nearby galaxies in the coming 6 yr.},

  abstract = {In a six-year program started in 2014 July, the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) will conduct novel cosmological observations using the BOSS spectrograph at Apache Point Observatory. These observations will be conducted simultaneously with the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS) designed for variability studies and the Spectroscopic Identification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS) program designed for studies of X-ray sources. In particular, eBOSS will measure with percent-level precision the distance-redshift relation with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of matter. eBOSS will use four different tracers of the underlying matter density field to vastly expand the volume covered by BOSS and map the large-scale-structures over the relatively unconstrained redshift range0.6 < z < 2.2. Using more than 250,000 new, spectroscopically confirmed luminous red galaxies at a median redshift z = 0.72, we project that eBOSS will yield measurements of the angular diameter distance d A ( z ) to an accuracy of 1.2% and measurements of H ( z ) to 2.1% when combined with the z > 0.6 sample of BOSS galaxies. With ∼195,000 new emission line galaxy redshifts, we expect BAO measurements of d A ( z ) to an accuracy of 3.1% and H ( z ) to 4.7% at an effective redshift of z = 0.87. A sample of more than 500,000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars will provide the first BAO distance measurements over the redshift range0.9 < z < 2.2, with expected precision of 2.8% and 4.2% on d A ( z ) and H ( z ), respectively. Finally, with 60,000 new quasars and re-observation of 60,000 BOSS quasars, we will obtain new Ly α forest measurements at redshifts z > 2.1; these new data will enhance the precision of d A ( z ) and H ( z ) at z > 2.1 by a factor of 1.44 relative to BOSS. Furthermore, eBOSS will provide improved tests of General Relativity on cosmological scales through redshift-space distortion measurements, improved tests for non-Gaussianity in the primordial density field, and new constraints on the summed mass of all neutrino species. Here, we provide an overview of the cosmological goals, spectroscopic target sample, demonstration of spectral quality from early data, and projected cosmological constraints from eBOSS.},

  title       = {The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey of SDSS-III},
  abstract    = {The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) is designed to measure the scale of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of matter over a larger volume than the combined efforts of all previous spectroscopic surveys of large scale structure. BOSS uses 1.5 million luminous galaxies as faint as i=19.9 over 10,000 square degrees to measure BAO to redshifts z<0.7. Observations of neutral hydrogen in the Lyman alpha forest in more than 150,000 quasar spectra (g<22) will constrain BAO over the redshift range 2.15<z<3.5. Early results from BOSS include the first detection of the large-scale three-dimensional clustering of the Lyman alpha forest and a strong detection from the Data Release 9 data set of the BAO in the clustering of massive galaxies at an effective redshift z = 0.57. We project that BOSS will yield measurements of the angular diameter distance D_A to an accuracy of 1.0% at redshifts z=0.3 and z=0.57 and measurements of H(z) to 1.8% and 1.7% at the same redshifts. Forecasts for Lyman alpha forest constraints predict a measurement of an overall dilation factor that scales the highly degenerate D_A(z) and H^{-1}(z) parameters to an accuracy of 1.9% at z~2.5 when the survey is complete. Here, we provide an overview of the selection of spectroscopic targets, planning of observations, and analysis of data and data quality of BOSS.},

LRG targets are required to meet a set of color selection criteria and have z-band and i-band MODEL magnitudes z < 19.95 and 19.9 < i < 21.8, respectively. Our algorithm selects roughly 50 LRG targets per square degree, the great majority of which lie in the redshift range 0.6 < z < 1.0 (median redshift 0.71). We demonstrate that our methods are highly effective at eliminating stellar contamination and lower-redshift galaxies. We perform a number of tests using spectroscopic data from SDSS-III/BOSS to determine the redshift reliability of our target selection and its ability to meet the science requirements of eBOSS. The SDSS spectra are of high enough signal-to-noise ratio that at least 89% of the target sample yields secure redshift measurements. We also present tests of the uniformity and homogeneity of the sample, demonstrating that it should be clean enough for studies of the large-scale structure of the universe at higher redshifts than SDSS-III/BOSS LRGs reached.},

Key to analysing the clustering of these data to provide cosmological measurements is understanding the detailed properties of this sample. Potential issues include variations in the target catalogue caused by changes either in the targeting algorithm or properties of the data used, the pattern of spectroscopic observations, the spatial distribution of targets for which redshifts were not obtained, and variations in the target sky density due to observational systematics. We document here the target selection algorithms used to create the galaxy samples that comprise BOSS. We also present the algorithms used to create large scale structure catalogues for the final Data Release (DR12) samples and the associated random catalogues that quantify the survey mask. The algorithms are an evolution of those used by the BOSS team to construct catalogues from earlier data, and have been designed to accurately quantify the galaxy sample. The code used, designated MKSAMPLE, is released with this paper.},

  title       = {The extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS): testing a new approach to measure the evolution of the structure growth},
  abstract    = {The extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) is one of the first of a new generation of galaxy redshift surveys that will cover a large range in redshift with sufficient resolution to measure the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) signal. For surveys covering a large redshift range we can no longer ignore cosmological evolution, meaning that either the redshift shells analysed have to be significantly narrower than the survey, or we have to allow for the averaging over evolving quantities. Both of these have the potential to remove signal: analysing small volumes increases the size of the Fourier window function, reducing the large-scale information, while averaging over evolving quantities can, if not performed carefully, remove differential information. It will be important to measure cosmological evolution from these surveys to explore and discriminate between models. We apply a method to optimally extract this differential information to mock catalogues designed to mimic the eBOSS quasar sample. By applying a set of weights to extract redshift space distortion measurements as a function of redshift, we demonstrate an analysis that does not invoke the problems discussed above. We show that our estimator gives unbiased constraints.},

The CANDELS/Deep survey (5σ point-source limit H = 27.7 mag) covers ~125 arcmin 2 within Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS)-N and GOODS-S. The CANDELS/Wide survey includes GOODS and three additional fields (Extended Groth Strip, COSMOS, and Ultra-deep Survey) and covers the full area to a 5σ point-source limit of H ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 27.0 mag. Together with the Hubble Ultra Deep Fields, the strategy creates a three-tiered "wedding-cake" approach that has proven efficient for extragalactic surveys. Data from the survey are nonproprietary and are useful for a wide variety of science investigations. In this paper, we describe the basic motivations for the survey, the CANDELS team science goals and the resulting observational requirements, the field selection and geometry, and the observing design.

Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected, each with extensive multi-wavelength observations. The primary CANDELS data consist of imaging obtained in the Wide Field Camera 3 infrared channel (WFC3/IR) and the WFC3 ultraviolet/optical channel, along with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The CANDELS/Deep survey covers ~125 arcmin 2 within GOODS-N and GOODS-S, while the remainder consists of the CANDELS/Wide survey, achieving a total of ~800 arcmin 2 across GOODS and three additional fields (Extended Groth Strip, COSMOS, and Ultra-Deep Survey). We summarize the observational aspects of the survey as motivated by the scientific goals and present a detailed description of the data reduction procedures and products from the survey. Our data reduction methods utilize the most up-to-date calibration files and image combination procedures. We have paid special attention to correcting a range of instrumental effects, including charge transfer efficiency degradation for ACS, removal of electronic bias-striping present in ACS data after Servicing Mission 4, and persistence effects and other artifacts in WFC3/IR. For each field, we release mosaics for individual epochs and eventual mosaics containing data from all epochs combined, to facilitate photometric variability studies and the deepest possible photometry. A more detailed overview of the science goals and observational design of the survey are presented in a companion paper.},

All these fields have a wealth of publicly available imaging data sets in addition to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data, which makes it possible to construct the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of objects over a wide wavelength range. In this paper we describe a photometric analysis of the CANDELS and 3D-HST HST imaging and the ancillary imaging data at wavelengths 0.3-8 μm. Objects were selected in the WFC3 near-IR bands, and their SEDs were determined by carefully taking the effects of the point-spread function in each observation into account. A total of 147 distinct imaging data sets were used in the analysis. The photometry is made available in the form of six catalogs: one for each field, as well as a master catalog containing all objects in the entire survey. We also provide derived data products: photometric redshifts, determined with the EAZY code, and stellar population parameters determined with the FAST code. We make all the imaging data that were used in the analysis available, including our reductions of the WFC3 imaging in all five fields. 3D-HST is a spectroscopic survey with the WFC3 and ACS grisms, and the photometric catalogs presented here constitute a necessary first step in the analysis of these grism data. All the data presented in this paper are available through the 3D-HST Web site (http://3dhst.research.yale.edu).},

  abstract      = {We analyze the star-forming and structural properties of 45 massive (log(M/M $_{⊙}$) $\gt$10) compact star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at 2 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3 to explore whether they are progenitors of compact quiescent galaxies at z \~{} 2. The optical/NIR and far-IR Spitzer/Herschel colors indicate that most compact SFGs are heavily obscured. Nearly half (47\%) host an X-ray-bright active galactic nucleus (AGN). In contrast, only about 10\% of other massive galaxies at that time host AGNs. Compact SFGs have centrally concentrated light profiles and spheroidal morphologies similar to quiescent galaxies and are thus strikingly different from other SFGs, which typically are disk-like and sometimes clumpy or irregular. Most compact SFGs lie either within the star formation rate (SFR)-mass main sequence (65\%) or below it (30\%), on the expected evolutionary path toward quiescent galaxies. These results show conclusively that galaxies become more compact before they lose their gas and dust, quenching star formation. Using extensive HST photometry from CANDELS and grism spectroscopy from the 3D-HST survey, we model their stellar populations with either exponentially declining ({$\tau$}) star formation histories (SFHs) or physically motivated SFHs drawn from semianalytic models (SAMs). SAMs predict longer formation timescales and older ages \~{}2 Gyr, which are nearly twice as old as the estimates of the {$\tau$} models. Both models yield good spectral energy distribution fits, indicating that the systematic uncertainty in the age due to degeneracies in the SFH is of that order of magnitude. However, SAM SFHs better match the observed slope and zero point of the SFR-mass main sequence. Contrary to expectations, some low-mass compact SFGs (log(M/M $_{⊙}$) =10-10.6) have younger ages but lower specific SFRs than that of more massive galaxies, suggesting that the low-mass galaxies reach the red sequence faster. If the progenitors of compact SFGs are extended SFGs, state-of-the-art SAMs show that mergers and disk instabilities (DIs) are both able to shrink galaxies, but DIs are more frequent (60\% versus 40\%) and form more concentrated galaxies. We confirm this result via high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations.},

  abstract      = {We present the results of a new study of dust attenuation at redshifts 3 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 4 based on a sample of 236 star-forming galaxies from the VANDELS spectroscopic survey. Motivated by results from the First Billion Years (FiBY) simulation project, we argue that the intrinsic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of star-forming galaxies at these redshifts have a self-similar shape across the mass range 8.2 {\le} log (M$_{⋆}$/M$_{⊙}$) {\le} 10.6 probed by our sample. Using FiBY data, we construct a set of intrinsic SED templates which incorporate both detailed star formation and chemical abundance histories, and a variety of stellar population synthesis (SPS) model assumptions. With this set of intrinsic SEDs, we present a novel approach for directly recovering the shape and normalization of the dust attenuation curve. We find, across all of the intrinsic templates considered, that the average attenuation curve for star-forming galaxies at z {\sime} 3.5 is similar in shape to the commonly adopted Calzetti starburst law, with an average total-to-selective attenuation ratio of R$_{V}$ = 4.18 {\plusmn} 0.29. In contrast, we find that an average attenuation curve as steep as the SMC extinction law is strongly disfavoured. We show that the optical attenuation (A$_{V}$) versus stellar mass (M$_{⋆}$) relation predicted using our method is consistent with recent ALMA observations of galaxies at 2 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3 in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), as well as empirical A$_{V}$ - M$_{⋆}$ relations predicted by a Calzetti-like law. In fact, our results, combined with other literature data, suggest that the A$_{V}$-M$_{⋆}$ relation does not evolve over the redshift range 0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 5, at least for galaxies with log(M$_{⋆}$/M$_{⊙}$) {\gsim} 9.5. Finally, we present tentative evidence which suggests that the attenuation curve may become steeper at lower masses log(M$_{⋆}$/M$_{⊙}$) {\lsim} 9.0.},

  abstract      = {This paper describes the observations and the first data release (DR1) of the ESO public spectroscopic survey ``VANDELS, a deep VIMOS survey of the CANDELS CDFS and UDS fields''. VANDELS' main targets are star-forming galaxies at 2.4$\lt$z$\lt$5.5 and massive passive galaxies at 1$\lt$z$\lt$2.5. By adopting a strategy of ultra-long exposure times, from 20 to 80 hours per source, VANDELS is designed to be the deepest ever spectroscopic survey of the high-redshift Universe. Exploiting the red sensitivity of the VIMOS spectrograph, the survey has obtained ultra-deep spectra covering the wavelength 4800-10000 A with sufficient signal-to-noise to investigate the astrophysics of high-redshift galaxy evolution via detailed absorption line studies. The VANDELS-DR1 is the release of all spectra obtained during the first season of observations and includes data for galaxies for which the total (or half of the total) scheduled integration time was completed. The release contains 879 individual objects with a measured redshift and includes fully wavelength and flux-calibrated 1D spectra, the associated error spectra, sky spectra and wavelength-calibrated 2D spectra. We also provide a catalog with the essential galaxy parameters, including spectroscopic redshifts and redshift quality flags. In this paper we present the survey layout and observations, the data reduction and redshift measurement procedure and the general properties of the VANDELS-DR1 sample. We also discuss the spectroscopic redshift distribution, the accuracy of the photometric redshifts and we provide some examples of data products. All VANDELS-DR1 data are publicly available and can be retrieved from the ESO archive. Two further data releases are foreseen in the next 2 years with a final release scheduled for June 2020 which will include improved re-reduction of the entire spectroscopic data set. (abridged)},

This enabled the first compilation of the multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of a statistically reliable survey of SMGs. In this paper, we present a new calibration of the magphys SED modeling code that is optimized to fit these ultraviolet-to-radio SEDs of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn1.gif] {$z\gt 1$} star-forming galaxies using an energy balance technique to connect the emission from stellar populations, dust attenuation, and dust emission in a physically consistent way. We derive statistically and physically robust estimates of the photometric redshifts and physical parameters (such as stellar masses, dust attenuation, star formation rates (SFRs), and dust masses) for the ALESS SMGs. We find that the ALESS SMGs have median stellar mass ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn2.gif] {${M}_{*}=8.9\pm 0.1\times {10}^{10}\;{M}_{\odot }$} , median SFR ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn3.gif] {$=\;280\pm 70\;{M}_{\odot }\;{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$} , median overall V -band dust attenuation ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn4.gif] {${A}_{V}=1.9\pm 0.2$} mag, median dust mass ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn5.gif] {${M}_{\mathrm{dust}}=(5.6\pm 1.0)\times {10}^{8}\;{M}_{\odot }$} , and median average dust temperature ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn6.gif] {${T}_{\mathrm{dust}}\simeq 40$} K. We find that the average intrinsic SED of the ALESS SMGs resembles that of local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies in the infrared range, but the stellar emission of our average SMG is brighter and bluer, indicating lower dust attenuation, possibly because they are more extended. We explore how the average SEDs vary with different parameters (redshift, sub-millimeter flux, dust attenuation, and total infrared luminosity), and we provide a new set of SMG templates that can be used to interpret other SMG observations. To put the ALESS SMGs into context, we compare their stellar masses and SFRs with those of less actively star-forming galaxies at the same redshifts. We find that at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn7.gif] {$z\simeq 2$} , about half of the SMGs lie above the star-forming main sequence (with SFRs three times larger than normal galaxies of the same stellar mass), while half are consistent with being at the high-mass end of the main sequence. At higher redshifts ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn8.gif] {$z\simeq 3.5$} ), the SMGs tend to have higher SFRs and stellar masses, but the fraction of SMGs that lie significantly above the main sequence decreases to less than a third.},

  abstract      = {We present results from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) photometric redshift methods investigation. In this investigation, the results from 11 participants, each using a different combination of photometric redshift code, template spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and priors, are used to examine the properties of photometric redshifts applied to deep fields with broadband multi-wavelength coverage. The photometry used includes U-band through mid-infrared filters and was derived using the TFIT method. Comparing the results, we find that there is no particular code or set of template SEDs that results in significantly better photometric redshifts compared to others. However, we find that codes producing the lowest scatter and outlier fraction utilize a training sample to optimize photometric redshifts by adding zero-point offsets, template adjusting, or adding extra smoothing errors. These results therefore stress the importance of the training procedure. We find a strong dependence of the photometric redshift accuracy on the signal-to-noise ratio of the photometry. On the other hand, we find a weak dependence of the photometric redshift scatter with redshift and galaxy color. We find that most photometric redshift codes quote redshift errors (e.g., 68\% confidence intervals) that are too small compared to that expected from the spectroscopic control sample. We find that all codes show a statistically significant bias in the photometric redshifts. However, the bias is in all cases smaller than the scatter; the latter therefore dominates the errors. Finally, we find that combining results from multiple codes significantly decreases the photometric redshift scatter and outlier fraction. We discuss different ways of combining data to produce accurate photometric redshifts and error estimates.},

In this review, we first explain the basics of Bayesian theory and discuss how to set up data analysis problems within this framework. Next, we provide an overview of various Monte Carlo–based methods for performing Bayesian data analysis. Finally, we discuss advanced ideas that enable us to tackle complex problems and thus hold great promise for the future.

  abstract = {We present far-infrared (FIR) photometry at 150 and 205 {$\mu$}m of eight low-redshift starburst galaxies obtained with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) ISOPHOT. Five of the eight galaxies are detected in both wave bands, and these data are used, in conjunction with IRAS archival photometry, to model the dust emission at {$\lambda$}$\gt$\~{}40 {$\mu$}m. The FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are best fitted by a combination of two modified Planck functions, with T\~{}40-55 K (warm dust) and T\~{}20-23 K (cool dust) and with a dust emissivity index {$\epsilon$}=2. The cool dust can be a major contributor to the FIR emission of starburst galaxies, representing up to 60\% of the total flux. This component is heated not only by the general interstellar radiation field, but also by the starburst itself. The cool dust mass is up to \~{}150 times larger than the warm dust mass, bringing the gas-to-dust ratios of the starbursts in our sample close to Milky Way values, once rescaled for the appropriate metallicity. The ratio between the total dust FIR emission in the range 1-1000 {$\mu$}m and the IRAS FIR emission in the range 40-120 {$\mu$}m is \~{}1.75, with small variations from galaxy to galaxy. This ratio is about 40\% larger than previously inferred from data at millimeter wavelengths. Although the galaxies in our sample are generally classified as ``UV bright,'' for four of them the UV energy emerging shortward of 0.2 {$\mu$}m is less than 15\% of the FIR energy. On average, about 30\% of the bolometric flux is coming out in the UV-to-near-IR wavelength range; the rest is emitted in the FIR. Energy balance calculations show that the FIR emission predicted by the dust reddening of the UV-to-near-IR stellar emission is within a factor of \~{}2 of the observed value in individual galaxies and within 20\% when averaged over a large sample. If our sample of local starbursts is representative of high-redshift (z$\gt$\~{}1), UV-bright, star-forming galaxies, these galaxies' FIR emission will be generally undetected in submillimeter surveys, unless (1) their bolometric luminosity is comparable to or larger than that of ultraluminous FIR galaxies and (2) their FIR SED contains a cool dust component.

The optical spectra have been obtained using an aperture which matches that of IUE, so comparable regions within each galaxy are sampled. The data from the 39 galaxies are compared with five models for the geometrical distribution of dust, adopting as extinction laws both the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud laws. The commonly used uniform dust screen is included among the models. We find that none of the five models is in satisfactory agreement with the data. In order to understand the discrepancy between the data and the models, we have derived an extinction law directly from the data in the UV and optical wavelength range. The resulting curve is characterized by an overall slope which is more gray than the Milky Way extinction law's slope, and by the absence of the 2175 A dust feature. Remarkably, the difference in optical depth between the Balmer emission lines H$_{alpha}$ and H$_{beta}$ is about a factor of 2 larger than the difference in the optical depth between the continuum underlying the two Balmer lines. We interpret this discrepancy as a consequence of the fact that the hot ionizing stars are associated with dustier regions than the cold stellar population is. The absence of the 2175 A dust feature can be due either to the effects of the scattering and clumpiness of the dust or to a chemical composition different from that of the Milky Way dust grains. Disentangling the two interpretations is not easy because of the complexity of the spatial distribution of the emitting regions. The extinction law of the UV and optical spectral continua of extended regions can be applied to the spectra of medium- and high-redshift galaxies, where extended regions of a galaxy are, by necessity, sampled.},

  abstract = {We present an analysis of galaxies in the CDF-South. We find a tight relation to z = 3 between color and size at a given mass, with red galaxies being small, and blue galaxies being large. We show that the relation is driven by stellar surface density or inferred velocity dispersion: galaxies with high surface density are red and have low specific star formation rates, and galaxies with low surface density are blue and have high specific star formation rates. Surface density and inferred velocity dispersion are better correlated with specific star formation rate and color than stellar mass. Hence stellar mass by itself is not a good predictor of the star formation history of galaxies. In general, galaxies at a given surface density have higher specific star formation rates at higher redshift. Specifically, galaxies with a surface density of (1–3) × 10 9 M ☉ kpc −2 are "red and dead" at low redshift, approximately 50% are forming stars at z = 1, and almost all are forming stars by z = 2. This provides direct additional evidence for the late evolution of galaxies onto the red sequence. The sizes of galaxies at a given mass evolve like 1/(1 + z ) 0.59 ± 0.10 . Hence galaxies undergo significant upsizing in their history. The size evolution is fastest for the highest mass galaxies and quiescent galaxies. The persistence of the structural relations from z = 0 to z = 2.5, and the upsizing of galaxies imply that a relation analogous to the Hubble sequence exists out to z = 2.5, and possibly beyond. The star-forming galaxies at z ≥ 1.5 are quite different from star-forming galaxies at z = 0, as they have likely very high gas fractions, and star formation timescales comparable to the orbital time.},

Random uncertainties in the measured parameters are estimated for each individual object based on a comparison between multiple, independent measurements of the same set of objects. To quantify systematic uncertainties, we create a mosaic with simulated galaxy images with a realistic distribution of input parameters and then process and analyze the mosaic in an identical manner as the real data.

  abstract = {Strong size and internal density evolution of early-type galaxies between z ~ 2 and the present has been reported by several authors. Here we analyze samples of nearby and distant ( z ~ 1) galaxies with dynamically measured masses in order to confirm the previous, model-dependent results and constrain the uncertainties that may play a role. Velocity dispersion (σ) measurements are taken from the literature for 50 morphologically selected 0.8 < z < 1.2 field and cluster early-type galaxies with typical masses M dyn = 2 × 10 11 M ☉ . Sizes ( R eff ) are determined with Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging. We compare the distant sample with a large sample of nearby ( 0.04 < z < 0.08) early-type galaxies extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey for which we determine sizes, masses, and densities in a consistent manner, using simulations to quantify systematic differences between the size measurements of nearby and distant galaxies. We find a highly significant difference between the σ − R eff distributions of the nearby and distant samples, regardless of sample selection effects. The implied evolution in R eff at fixed mass between z = 1 and the present is a factor of 1.97 ± 0.15. This is in qualitative agreement with semianalytic models; however, the observed evolution is much faster than the predicted evolution. Our results reinforce and are quantitatively consistent with previous, photometric studies that found size evolution of up to a factor of 5 since z ~ 2. A combination of structural evolution of individual galaxies through the accretion of companions and the continuous formation of early-type galaxies through increasingly gas-poor mergers is one plausible explanation of the observations.},

  abstract      = {<BR /> Aims: We aim to test the impact of using variable star-forming histories (SFHs) and the IR luminosity as a constrain on the physical parameters of high redshift dusty star-forming galaxies. We explore in particular the properties (SFHs, ages, timescales) of galaxies depending on their belonging to the ``main sequence'' of star-forming galaxies (MS). <BR /> Methods: We performed spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of the UV-to-NIR and FIR emissions of a moderately large sample of GOODS-Herschel galaxies, for which rich multi-wavelength, optical to IR observations are available. We tested different SFHs and the impact of imposing energy conservation in the SED fitting process, to help with issues like the age-extinction degeneracy and produce SEDs consistent with observations. <BR /> Results: Our simple models produce well constrained SEDs for the broad majority of the sample (84\%), with the notable exception of the very high L$_{IR}$ end, for which we have indications that the energy conservation hypothesis cannot hold true for a single component population approach. We observe trends in the preferences in SFHs among our sources depending on stellar mass M$_{⋆}$ and z. Trends also emerge in the characteristic timescales of the SED models depending on the location on the SFR - M$_{⋆}$ diagram. We show that whilst using the same available observational data, we can produce galaxies less star-forming than classically inferred, if we allow rapidly declining SFHs, while properly reproducing their observables. These sources, representing 7\% of the sample, can be post-starbursts undergoing quenching, and their SFRs are potentially overestimated if inferred from their L$_{IR}$. Based on the trends observed in the rising SFH fits we explore a simple evolution model for stellar mass build-up over the considered time period. <BR /> Conclusions: Our approach successfully breaks the age-extinction degeneracy, and enables to evaluate properly the SFRs of the sources in the SED fitting process. Fitting without the IR constrain leads to a strong preference for declining SFHs, while its inclusion increases the preference of rising SFHs, more so at high z, in tentative agreement with the cosmic star-formation history (CSFH), although this result suffers from poor statistics. Keeping in mind that the sample is biased toward high luminosities and intense star formation, the evolution shaped by our model appears as both bursty (in its early stages) and steady-lasting (later on). The SFH of the sample considered as a whole follows the CSFH with a surprisingly small scatter, and is compatible with other studies supporting that the more massive galaxies have built most of their mass earlier than lower mass galaxies.},

After converting all observations to a common set of calibrations, we find a remarkable consensus among MS observations (~0.1 dex 1σ interpublication scatter). By fitting for time evolution of the MS in bins of constant mass, we deconvolve the observed scatter about the MS within each observed redshift bin. After accounting for observed scatter between different SFR indicators, we find the width of the MS distribution is ~0.2 dex and remains constant over cosmic time. Our best fits indicate the slope of the MS is likely time-dependent, with our best-fit log SFR( M * , t ) = (0.84 ± 0.02 – 0.026 ± 0.003 × t )log M * – (6.51 ± 0.24 – 0.11 ± 0.03 × t ), where t is the age of the universe in Gyr. We use our fits to create empirical evolutionary tracks in order to constrain MS galaxy star formation histories (SFHs), finding that (1) the most accurate representations of MS SFHs are given by delayed-τ models, (2) the decline in fractional stellar mass growth for a "typical" MS galaxy today is approximately linear for most of its lifetime, and (3) scatter about the MS can be generated by galaxies evolving along identical evolutionary tracks assuming an initial 1σ spread in formation times of ~1.4 Gyr.},

  abstract      = {This is the first in a series of papers examining the demographics of star-forming galaxies at $0.2\ltz\lt2.5$ in CANDELS. We study 9,100 galaxies from GOODS-S and UDS having published values of redshifts, masses, star-formation rates (SFRs), and dust attenuation ($A\_V$) derived from UV-optical SED fitting. In agreement with previous works, we find that the $UVJ$ colors of a galaxy are closely correlated with its specific star-formation rate (SSFR) and $A\_V$. We define rotated $UVJ$ coordinate axes, termed $S\_\mathrm{SED}$ and $C\_\mathrm{SED}$, that are parallel and perpendicular to the star-forming sequence and derive a quantitative calibration that predicts SSFR from $C\_\mathrm{SED}$ with an accuracy of \~{}0.2 dex. SFRs from UV-optical fitting and from UV+IR values based on Spitzer/MIPS 24 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ agree well overall, but systematic differences of order 0.2 dex exist at high and low redshifts. A novel plotting scheme conveys the evolution of multiple galaxy properties simultaneously, and dust growth, as well as star-formation decline and quenching, exhibit ``mass-accelerated evolution'' (``downsizing''). A population of transition galaxies below the star-forming main sequence is identified. These objects are located between star-forming and quiescent galaxies in $UVJ$ space and have lower $A\_V$ and smaller radii than galaxies on the main sequence. Their properties are consistent with their being in transit between the two regions. The relative numbers of quenched, transition, and star-forming galaxies are given as a function of mass and redshift.},

  abstract      = {Recent studies have shown that massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift are much more compact than present-day galaxies of the same mass. Here we compare the radial stellar density profiles and the number density of a sample of massive galaxies at z ~ 2.3 to nearby massive elliptical galaxies. We confirm that the average stellar densities of the z ~ 2.3 galaxies within the effective radius, ρ(< r e ), are two orders of magnitude higher than those of local elliptical galaxies of the same stellar mass. However, we also find that the densities measured within a constant physical radius of 1 kpc, ρ(<1 kpc), are higher by a factor of 2-3 only. This suggests that inside-out growth scenarios are plausible, in which the compact high-redshift galaxies make up the centers of normal nearby ellipticals. The compact galaxies are common at high redshift, which enables us to further constrain their evolution by requiring that the number density of their descendants does not exceed constraints imposed by the z = 0 galaxy mass function. We infer that size growth must be efficient, with ( r 1+2 / r 1 ) ~ ( M 1+2 / M 1 ) 2 . A simple model where compact galaxies with masses ~10 11 M ☉ primarily grow through minor mergers produces descendants with the approximate sizes, stellar densities, and number density of elliptical galaxies with masses 2-3 × 10 11 M ☉ in the local universe. We note that this model also predicts evolution in the M BH – σ relation, such that the progenitors of elliptical galaxies have lower black hole masses at fixed velocity dispersion. The main observational uncertainty is the conversion from light to mass; measurements of kinematics are needed to calibrate the masses and stellar densities of the high-redshift galaxies.},

The spectra, taken at the Keck telescope, show emission lines in 88% of our sample, and only absorption lines in the remaining 12%. Emission-line profiles are roughly Gaussian with velocity widths that range from the measurement limit of σ ~ 35 km s -1 to 150 km s -1 . Rest frame [O II ] λ3727 equivalent widths range from 5 to 94 Å, yielding star formation rates (SFRs) of ~0.1 to 14 M ☉ yr -1 . The analysis of various line diagnostic diagrams reveals that ~60% of compact emission-line galaxies have velocity widths, excitations, Hβ luminosities, SFRs, and mass-to-light ratios characteristic of young star-forming H II galaxies. The remaining 40% form a more heterogeneous class of evolved starbursts, similar to local starburst disk galaxies. We find that, although the compact galaxies at z > 0.7 have similar SFRs per unit mass to those at z < 0.7, they are on average ~10 times more massive . Our sample implies a lower limit for the global comoving SFR density of ~0.004 M ☉ yr -1 Mpc -3 at z = 0.55, and ~0.008 M ☉ yr -1 Mpc -3 at z = 0.85 (assuming Salpeter IMF, H 0 = 50 km s -1 Mpc -1 , and q 0 = 0.5). These values, when compared to estimates for a sample of local compact galaxies selected in a similar fashion, support a history of the universe in which the SFR density declines by a factor ~10 from z = 1 to today. From the comparison with the SFR densities derived for magnitude-limited samples of field galaxies, we conclude that compact emission-line galaxies, though only ~20% of the general field population, may contribute as much as ~45% to the global SFR of the universe at 0.4 < z < 1.},

Such size evolution is most likely explained by the `dry merger sceanario'. However, previous studies based on this scenario cannot consistently explain the properties of both high-z compact massive ETGs and local ETGs. We investigate the effect of multiple sequential dry minor mergers on the size evolution of compact massive ETGs. From an analysis of the Millennium Simulation Data Base, we show that such minor (stellar mass ratio M$_{2}$/M$_{1}$ $\lt$ 1/4) mergers are extremely common during hierarchical structure formation. We perform N-body simulations of sequential minor mergers with parabolic and head-on orbits, including a dark matter component and a stellar component. Typical mass ratios of these minor mergers are 1/20 $\lt$ M$_{2}$/M$_{1}$ {\le}q 1/10. We show that sequential minor mergers of compact satellite galaxies are the most efficient at promoting size growth and decreasing the velocity dispersion of compact massive ETGs in our simulations. The change of stellar size and density of the merger remnants is consistent with recent observations. Furthermore, we construct the merger histories of candidates for high-z compact massive ETGs using the Millennium Simulation Data Base and estimate the size growth of the galaxies through the dry minor merger scenario. We can reproduce the mean size growth factor between z = 2 and z = 0, assuming the most efficient size growth obtained during sequential minor mergers in our simulations. However, we note that our numerical result is only valid for merger histories with typical mass ratios between 1/20 and 1/10 with parabolic and head-on orbits and that our most efficient size-growth efficiency is likely an upper limit.},

Estimates of comoving volume densities indicate that the population of apparent H II galaxies evolves rapidly from redshifts of z ~ 1 to the present. It appears that not all of these galaxies can be progenitors of present-day spheroidal galaxies, although the numbers of them with sizes and masses comparable to spheroidals is not dissimilar to estimates of the local field spheroidal density.

We use very deep near-infrared images of the Hubble Deep Field-South and the MS 1054-03 field in the J s , H , and K s bands from FIRES to retrieve the sizes in the optical rest frame for galaxies with z > 1. We combine our results with those from GEMS at 0.2 < z < 1 and SDSS at z ~ 0.1 to achieve a comprehensive picture of the optical rest-frame size evolution from z = 0 to 3. Galaxies are differentiated according to their light concentration using the Sérsic index n . For less concentrated objects, the galaxies at a given luminosity were typically ~3 ± 0.5 (±2 σ) times smaller at z ~ 2.5 than those we see today. The stellar mass-size relation has evolved less: the mean size at a given stellar mass was ~2 ± 0.5 times smaller at z ~ 2.5, evolving proportionally to (1 + z ) -0.40±0.06 . Simple scaling relations between dark matter halos and baryons in a hierarchical cosmogony predict a stronger (although consistent within the error bars) than observed evolution of the stellar mass-size relation. The observed luminosity-size evolution out to z ~ 2.5 matches well recent infall model predictions for Milky Way-type objects. For low- n galaxies, the evolution of the stellar mass-size relation would follow naturally if the individual galaxies grow inside out. For highly concentrated objects, the situation is as follows: at a given luminosity, these galaxies were ~2.7 ± 1.1 times smaller at z ~ 2.5 (or, put differently, were typically ~2.2 ± 0.7 mag brighter at a given size than they are today), and at a given stellar mass the size has evolved proportionally to (1 + z ) -0.45±0.10 .},

  abstract      = {We present a detailed analysis of the structure and resolved stellar populations of simulated merger remnants, and compare them to observations of compact quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2. We find that major merging is a viable mechanism to produce systems of ~10 11 M ☉ and ~1 kpc size, provided the gas fraction at the time of final coalescence is high (~40%) and provided that the progenitors are compact star-forming galaxies, as expected at high redshift. Their integrated spectral energy distributions and velocity dispersions are in good agreement with the observations, and their position in the ( v maj /σ, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/epsi.gif] {epsilon} ) diagram traces the upper envelope of the distribution of lower redshift early-type galaxies. The simulated merger remnants show time- and sightline-dependent M / L ratio gradients that result from a superposition of radially dependent stellar age, stellar metallicity, and extinction. The median ratio of the effective radius in rest-frame V -band light to that in mass surface density is ~2 during the quiescent remnant phase. This is typically expressed by a negative color gradient (i.e., red core), which we expect to correlate with the integrated color of the system. Finally, the simulations differ from the observations in their surface brightness profile shape. The simulated remnants are typically best fit by high ( n ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/Gt.gif] {Gt} 4) Sérsic indices, whereas observed quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2 tend to be less cuspy ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lang.gif] {lang} n ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rang.gif] {rang} ~ 2.3).

Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; Data Release 7), we have conducted a search for local red sequence galaxies with sizes and masses comparable to those found at z ~ 2.3. The SDSS spectroscopic target selection algorithm excludes high surface brightness objects; we show that this makes incompleteness a concern for such massive, compact galaxies, particularly for low redshifts ( z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 0.05). We have identified63 M * >10 10.7 M ☉ ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 5 × 10 10 M ☉ ) red sequence galaxies at 0.066 < z spec < 0.12 which are smaller than the median size-mass relation by a factor of 2 or more. Consistent with expectations from the virial theorem, the median offset from the mass-velocity dispersion relation for these galaxies is 0.12 dex. We do not, however, find any galaxies with sizes and masses comparable to those observed at z ~ 2.3, implying a decrease in the comoving number density of these galaxies, at fixed size and mass, by a factor of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 5000. This result cannot be explained by incompleteness: in the 0.066 < z < 0.12 interval, we estimate that the SDSS spectroscopic sample should typically be ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 75% complete for galaxies with the sizes and masses seen at high redshift, although for the very smallest galaxies it may be as low as ~20%. In order to confirm that the absence of such compact massive galaxies in SDSS is not produced by spectroscopic selection effects, we have also looked for such galaxies in the basic SDSS photometric catalog, using photometric redshifts. While we do find signs of a slight bias against massive, compact galaxies, this analysis suggests that the SDSS spectroscopic sample is missing at most a few objects in the regime we consider. Accepting the high-redshift results, it is clear that massive galaxies must undergo significant structural evolution over z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 2 in order to match the population seen in the local universe.

We detect compact, star-forming galaxies (cSFGs) whose number densities, masses, sizes, and star formation rates (SFRs) qualify them as likely progenitors of compact, quiescent, massive galaxies (cQGs) at z = 1.5-3. At z $\gt$\~{} 2, cSFGs present SFR = 100-200 M $_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$, yet their specific star formation rates (sSFR \~{} 10$^{-9}$ yr$^{-1}$) are typically half that of other massive SFGs at the same epoch, and host X-ray luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs) 30 times (\~{}30\%) more frequently. These properties suggest that cSFGs are formed by gas-rich processes (mergers or disk-instabilities) that induce a compact starburst and feed an AGN, which, in turn, quench the star formation on dynamical timescales (few 10$^{8}$ yr). The cSFGs are continuously being formed at z = 2-3 and fade to cQGs down to z \~{} 1.5. After this epoch, cSFGs are rare, thereby truncating the formation of new cQGs. Meanwhile, down to z = 1, existing cQGs continue to enlarge to match local QGs in size, while less-gas-rich mergers and other secular mechanisms shepherd (larger) SFGs as later arrivals to the red sequence. In summary, we propose two evolutionary tracks of QG formation: an early (z $\gt$\~{} 2), formation path of rapidly quenched cSFGs fading into cQGs that later enlarge within the quiescent phase, and a late-arrival (z $\lt$\~{} 2) path in which larger SFGs form extended QGs without passing through a compact state.},

  abstract      = {The shutdown of star formation in galaxies is generally termed ``quenching.'' Quenching may occur through a variety of processes, e.g., active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, stellar feedback, or the shock heating of gas in the dark matter halo. However, which mechanism(s) is, in fact, responsible for quenching is still in question. This paper addresses quenching by searching for traces of possible quenching processes through their effects on galaxy structural parameters such as stellar mass (M $_{*}$), M $_{*}$/r $_{e}$, surface stellar mass density (\~{}M $_{*}$/r $^{2}$ $_{e}$), and S{\'e}rsic index (n). We analyze the rest-frame U - B color correlations versus these structural parameters using a sample of galaxies in the redshift range 0.5 $\lt$= z $\lt$ 0.8 from the DEEP2/AEGIS survey. In addition to global radii, stellar masses, and S{\'e}rsic parameters, we also use ``bulge'' and ``disk'' photometric measurements from GIM2D fits to HST/ACS V and I images. We assess the tightness of the color relationships by measuring their ``overlap regions,'' defined as the area in color-parameter space in which red and blue galaxies overlap; the parameter that minimizes these overlap regions is considered to be the most effective color discriminator. We find that S{\'e}rsic index (n) has the smallest overlap region among all tested parameters and resembles a step function with a threshold value of n = 2.3. There exists, however, a significant population of outliers with blue colors yet high n values that seem to contradict this behavior; they make up {\ap}40\% of n $\gt$ 2.3 galaxies. We hypothesize that their S{\'e}rsic values may be distorted by bursts of star formation, AGNs, and/or poor fits, leading us to consider central surface stellar mass density, {$\Sigma$}*$_{1 kpc}$, as an alternative to S{\'e}rsic index. Not only does {$\Sigma$}*$_{1 kpc}$ correct the outliers, but it also forms a tight relationship with color, suggesting that the innermost structure of galaxies is most physically linked with quenching. Furthermore, at z \~{} 0.65, the majority of the blue cloud galaxies cannot simply fade onto the red sequence since their GIM2D bulge masses are only half as large on average as the bulge masses of similar red sequence galaxies, thus demonstrating that stellar mass must absolutely increase at the centers of galaxies as they quench. We discuss a two-stage model for quenching in which galaxy star formation rates are controlled by their dark halos while they are still in the blue cloud and a second quenching process sets in later, associated with the central stellar mass buildup. The mass buildup is naturally explained by any non-axisymmetric features in the potential, such as those induced by mergers and/or disk instabilities. However, the identity of the second quenching agent is still unknown. We have placed our data catalog online.},

We find that at 1 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3 the passively evolving ETGs are the reddest and most massive objects in the universe, and we prove that a correlation between mass, morphology, color, and star formation activity is already in place at that epoch. We measure a significant evolution in the mass-size relation of passive ETGs from z \~{} 3 to z \~{} 1, with galaxies growing on average by a factor of two in size in a 3 Gyr timescale only. We also witness an increase in the number density of passive ETGs of 50 times over the same time interval. We find that the first ETGs to form at z $\gt$\~{} 2 are all compact or ultra-compact, while normal-sized ETGs (meaning ETGs with sizes comparable to those of local counterparts of the same mass) are the most common ETGs only at z $\lt$ 1. The increase of the average size of ETGs at 0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1 is primarily driven by the appearance of new large ETGs rather than by the size increase of individual galaxies.},

The gas-to-stellar ratios estimated from CO(8{\ndash}7) and the dust continuum emission span a broad range, f$_{gas}$$^{CO}$=M$_{gas}$/M$_{\star }$=13\%-45\% and f$_{gas}$$^{cont}$=50 \% -67\% , but are nonetheless consistent given the uncertainties in the conversion factors. The dynamical modeling yields a dynamical mass of log(M$_{dyn}$/M$_{⊙}$)=10.58$_{-0.2}$$^{+0.5}$,  which is lower, but still consistent with the baryonic mass, log(M$_{bar}$=M$_{\star}$+M$_{gas}$$^{CO}$/M$_{⊙}$)=11.0, if the smallest CO-based gas fraction is assumed. Despite a low, overall gas fraction, the small physical extent of the dense, star-forming gas probed by CO(8{\ndash}7), {\sim}3{\times} smaller than the stellar size, implies a strong relative concentration that increases the gas fraction up to f$_{gas}$$^{CO}$,1 kpc{\sim} 85 \%  in the central 1 kpc. Such a gas-rich center, coupled with a high star formation rate (SFR) {\sim} 500 M $_{⊙}$ yr$^{‑1}$, suggests that GDS-14876 is quickly assembling a dense stellar component (bulge) in a strong nuclear starburst.

We compare the observed fractions with predictions from a semi-analytic model which includes prescriptions for bulge growth and AGN feedback due to mergers and disc instabilities. We facilitate direct morphological comparison by converting our model bulge-to-total stellar mass ratios to S{\'e}rsic indices. We then subdivide our population into the four quadrants of the specific star formation rate-S{\'e}rsic index plane and study the build-up of each of these subpopulations. We find that the fraction of star-forming discs declines steadily, while the fraction of quiescent spheroids builds up over cosmic time. The fractions of star-forming spheroids and quiescent discs are both non-negligible, and stay nearly constant over the period we have studied. Our model is qualitatively successful at reproducing the evolution of the two `main' populations (star-forming discs and quiescent spheroids), and approximately reproduces the relative fractions of all four types, but predicts a stronger decline in star-forming spheroids, and increase in quiescent discs, than is seen in the observations. A model with an additional channel for bulge growth via disc instabilities agrees better overall with the observations than a model in which bulges can grow only through mergers. We also examine the relative importance of these different physical drivers of transformation (major and minor mergers and disc instabilities).},

  abstract      = {The mechanisms responsible for the remarkably small sizes of the most massive quiescent galaxies at z\~{}2 are poorly understood. Partly because the nature of their progenitors is still unknown. Barro+13,14 used the deepest HST WFC3/F160W data to identify, for the first time, a population of massive compact star-forming galaxies (cSFGs) at 2 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3, whose small sizes, stellar structures and number densities strongly suggest that they are the immediate progenitors of such population.These cSFGs have spheroidal morphologies and centrally-concentrated mass profiles very similar to those of quiescent galaxies. Yet, they still are strongly star-forming and heavily dust obscured, as evidenced by their H-alpha emission and far-IR (Spitzer/Herschel) colors. This strongly suggests that cSFGs are rapidly growing a dense stellar core, as those observed in quenched galaxies. Quite remarkably, this is confirmed by their gas dynamics. Barro+14b revealed that cSFGs at z\~{}2 have high gas velocity dispersions of \~{}250 km/s, consistent with the stellar kinematics of equally massive quiescent galaxies, and indicative of their large dynamical masses.},

  abstract  = {Nearby galaxies come in two flavors: red quiescent galaxies (QGs) with old stellar populations, and blue young star-forming galaxies (SFGs). This color bimodality seems to be already in place at z = 2 - 3, presenting also strong correlations with size and morphology. Surprisingly, massive QGs at higher redshifts are \~{}5 times smaller than local, equal mass analogs. In contrast, most of the massive SFGs at these redshifts are still relatively large disks. The strong bimodality in both SFR and sizes indicates that some SFGs must experience strong structural transformations accompanied by a rapid truncation of the star-formation to match the observed properties of QGs. Using high-resolution HST/WFC3 F160W imaging from the CANDELS survey in GOODS-S and UDS, along with multi-wavelength ancillary data, we analyze stellar masses, SFRs and sizes of a sample of massive (M$_{*}$ $\gt$ 10$^{10}$ M $_{⊙}$) galaxies at z = 1.4 - 3.0 to identify a population of compact SFGs with similar structural properties as compact QGs at z\~{}2. We also find that the number density of QGs increases rapidly since z = 3. Among these, the number of compact QGs builds up first, and only at z $\lt$ 1.8 we do start finding a sizable number of extended QGs. This suggests that the bulk of these galaxies are assembled at late times by both continuous migration (quenching) of non-compact SFGs and size growth of cQGs. As a result of this growth, the population of cQGs disappears by z\~{}1. Simultaneously, we identify a population of compact SFGs (cSFGs) whose number density decreases steadily with time since z = 3.0, being almost completely absent at z $\lt$ 1.4. The number of cSFGs makes up less than 20\% of all massive SFGs, but they present similar number densities as cQGs down to z\~{}2, suggesting an evolutionary link between the two populations.},

These cSFGs are likely the direct progenitors of the compact quiescent galaxies observed at this epoch, which are the first population of passive galaxies to appear in large numbers in the early Universe. We identify cSFGs that host an AGN using a combination of Hubble WFC3 imaging and Chandra X-ray observations in four fields: the Chandra Deep Fields, the Extended Groth Strip, and the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey field. We find that $\{$39.2$\}$$_{-3.6}$$^{+3.9}$ \%  (65/166) of cSFGs at 1.4$\lt$ z$\lt$ 3.0 host an X-ray detected AGN. This fraction is 3.2 times higher than the incidence of AGN in extended star-forming galaxies with similar masses at these redshifts. This difference is significant at the 6.2{$\sigma$}  level. Our results are consistent with models in which cSFGs are formed through a dissipative contraction that triggers a compact starburst and concurrent growth of the central black hole. We also discuss our findings in the context of cosmological galaxy evolution simulations that require feedback energy to rapidly quench cSFGs. We show that the AGN fraction peaks precisely where energy injection is needed to reproduce the decline in the number density of cSFGs with redshift. Our results suggest that the first abundant population of massive quenched galaxies emerged directly following a phase of elevated supermassive black hole growth and further hints at a possible connection between AGN and the rapid quenching of star formation in these galaxies.},

The high spatial resolution (FWHM ∼ 0.″12–0.″18) ALMA and Hubble Space Telescope photometry are combined to construct deconvolved, mean radial profiles of their stellar mass and (UV+IR) SFR. We find that the dusty, nuclear IR–SFR overwhelmingly dominates the bolometric SFR up to r ∼ 5 kpc, by a factor of over 100× from the unobscured UV–SFR. Furthermore, the effective radius of the mean SFR profile ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/827/2/L32/apjlaa31adieqn3.gif] {${r}_{{\rm{e,SFR}}}\sim 1$} kpc) is ∼30% smaller than that of the stellar mass profile. The implied structural evolution, if such nuclear starburst last for the estimated gas depletion time of Δ t = ±100 Myr, is a 4× increase of the stellar mass density within the central 1 kpc and a 1.6× decrease of the half-mass–radius. This structural evolution fully supports dissipation-driven, formation scenarios in which strong nuclear starbursts transform larger, star-forming progenitors into compact quiescent galaxies.},

Our sample contains 164 galaxies down to stellar mass ( M * ) of 10 8.5 M ⊙ in the CANDELS GOODS-N region, where Team Keck Redshift Survey Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy and Hubble Space Telescope /WFC3 F275W images from CANDELS and Hubble Deep UV Legacy Survey are available. When the ratio of H β - and FUV-derived SFRs is measured, dust extinction correction is negligible (except for very dusty galaxies) with the Calzetti attenuation curve. The H β -to-FUV ratio of our sample increases with M * and SFR. The median ratio is ∼0.7 at M * ∼ 10 8.5 M ⊙ (or SFR ∼ 0.5 M ⊙ yr −1 ) and increases to ∼1 at M * ∼ 10 10 M ⊙ (or SFR ∼ 10 M ⊙ yr −1 ). At M * < 10 9.5 M ⊙ , our median H β -to-FUV ratio is lower than that of local galaxies at the same M * , implying a redshift evolution. Bursty SFH on a timescale of a few tens of megayears on galactic scales provides a plausible explanation for our results, and the importance of the burstiness increases as M * decreases. Due to sample selection effects, our H β -to-FUV ratio may be an upper limit of the true value of a complete sample, which strengthens our conclusions. Other models, e.g., non-universal initial mass function or stochastic star formation on star cluster scales, are unable to plausibly explain our results.},

SHARDS provides medium-band photometry equivalent to low-resolution optical spectra (R {\tilde} 50), allowing us to obtain extremely accurate photometric redshifts (median |{$\Delta$}z|/(1 + z) {\tilde} 0.55 per cent) and to improve the constraints on the age distribution of the stellar populations. Our data set is volume limited, probing merger progenitors with mass ratios 1:100 ({$\mu$} {\equiv} M$_{sat}$/M$_{cen}$ = 0.01) out to z = 1.3. A strong correlation is found between the age difference of host and companion galaxy and stellar mass ratio, from negligible age differences in major mergers to age differences {\tilde}4 Gyr for 1:100 minor mergers. However, this correlation is simply a reflection of the mass-age trend in the general population. The dominant contributor to the growth of massive galaxies corresponds to mass ratios {$\mu$} {\gsim} 0.3, followed by a decrease in the fractional mass growth rate linearly proportional to log {$\mu$}, at least down to {$\mu$} {\tilde} 0.01, suggesting a decreasing role of mergers involving low-mass companions, especially if dynamical friction time-scales are taken into account. A simple model results in an upper limit for the average mass growth rate of massive galaxies of ({$\Delta$}M/M)/{$\Delta$}t {\tilde} 0.08 {\plusmn} 0.02 Gyr$^{-1}$, over the z {\lsim} 1 range, with an {\tilde}70 per cent fractional contribution from (major) mergers with {$\mu$} {\gsim} 0.3.

In a forthcoming companion paper, we analyze those SEDs to obtain robust estimations of stellar parameters such as photometric redshifts, stellar masses, and star formation rates. The catalog comprises 76,936 sources with [3.6] ≤ 23.75 mag (85% completeness level of the IRAC survey in the EGS) over 0.48 deg 2 . For approximately 16% of this sample, we are able to deconvolve the IRAC data to obtain robust fluxes for the multiple counterparts found in ground-based optical images. Typically, the SEDs of the IRAC sources in our catalog count with more than 15 photometric data points, spanning from the ultraviolet wavelengths probed by GALEX to the far-infrared observed by Spitzer , and going through ground- and space-based optical and near-infrared data taken with 2-8 m class telescopes. Approximately 95% and 90% of all IRAC sources are detected in the deepest optical and near-infrared bands. These fractions are reduced to 85% and 70% for S/N > 5 detections in each band. Only 10% of the sources in the catalog have optical spectroscopy and redshift estimations. Almost 20% and 2% of the sources are detected by MIPS at 24 and 70 μm, respectively. We also cross-correlate our catalog with public X-ray and radio catalogs. Finally, we present the Rainbow Navigator public Web interface utility, designed to browse all the data products resulting from this work, including images, spectra, photometry, and stellar parameters.},

  abstract      = {We present a robust method to constrain average galaxy star formation rates (SFRs), star formation histories (SFHs), and the intracluster light (ICL) as a function of halo mass. Our results are consistent with observed galaxy stellar mass functions, specific star formation rates (SSFRs), and cosmic star formation rates (CSFRs) from z = 0 to z = 8. We consider the effects of a wide range of uncertainties on our results, including those affecting stellar masses, SFRs, and the halo mass function at the heart of our analysis. As they are relevant to our method, we also present new calibrations of the dark matter halo mass function, halo mass accretion histories, and halo-subhalo merger rates out to z = 8. We also provide new compilations of CSFRs and SSFRs; more recent measurements are now consistent with the buildup of the cosmic stellar mass density at all redshifts. Implications of our work include: halos near 10$^{12}$ M $_{⊙}$ are the most efficient at forming stars at all redshifts, the baryon conversion efficiency of massive halos drops markedly after z \~{} 2.5 (consistent with theories of cold-mode accretion), the ICL for massive galaxies is expected to be significant out to at least z \~{} 1-1.5, and dwarf galaxies at low redshifts have higher stellar mass to halo mass ratios than previous expectations and form later than in most theoretical models. Finally, we provide new fitting formulae for SFHs that are more accurate than the standard declining tau model. Our approach places a wide variety of observations relating to the SFH of galaxies into a self-consistent framework based on the modern understanding of structure formation in {$\Lambda$}CDM.

  abstract      = {Recent deep Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 imaging suggests that a majority of compact quiescent massive galaxies at z ~ 2 may contain disks. To investigate this claim, we have compared the ellipticity distribution of 31 carefully selected high-redshift massive quiescent compact galaxies to a set of mass-selected ellipticity and Sérsic index distributions obtained from two-dimensional structural fits to ~40, 000 nearby galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test shows that the distribution of ellipticities for the high-redshift galaxies is consistent with the ellipticity distribution of a similarly chosen sample of massive early-type galaxies. However, the distribution of Sérsic indices for the high-redshift sample is inconsistent with that of local early-type galaxies, and instead resembles that of local disk-dominated populations. The mismatch between the properties of high-redshift compact galaxies and those of both local early-type and disk-dominated systems leads us to conclude that the basic structures of high-redshift compact galaxies probably do not closely resemble those of any single local galaxy population. Any galaxy population analog to the high-redshift compact galaxies that exists at the current epoch is either a mix of different types of galaxies, or possibly a unique class of objects on their own.},

The evolution in number density of these extreme objects over cosmic time is the crucial constraining factor for the models of massive galaxy assembly. We select a large sample of ~200 intermediate-redshift massive compacts from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) spectroscopy by identifying point-like Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometric sources with spectroscopic signatures of evolved redshifted galaxies. A subset of our targets have publicly available high-resolution ground-based images that we use to augment the dynamical and stellar population properties of these systems by their structural parameters. We confirm that all BOSS compact candidates are as compact as their high-redshift massive counterparts and less than half the size of similarly massive systems at z ~ 0. We use the completeness-corrected numbers of BOSS compacts to compute lower limits on their number densities in narrow redshift bins spanning the range of our sample. The abundance of extremely dense quiescent galaxies at 0.2 < z < 0.6 is in excellent agreement with the number densities of these systems at high redshift. Our lower limits support the models of massive galaxy assembly through a series of minor mergers over the redshift range 0 < z < 2.},

Our rest-frame R -band images show that most of these objects have compact regular morphologies which follow the classical R 1/4 law.

Around one-third (3/10) of the massive red objects in the GDDS sample are extraordinarily compact, with effective radii under 1 kpc.

We introduce a new "stellar mass Kormendy relation" (stellar mass density versus size) which we use to single out the effects of size evolution from those of luminosity and color evolution in stellar populations. The 1 < z < 2 passive galaxies have mass densities that are an order of magnitude larger then early-type galaxies today and are comparable to the compact distant red galaxies at 2 < z < 3. We briefly consider mechanisms for size evolution in contemporary models focusing on equal-mass mergers and adiabatic expansion driven by stellar mass loss. Neither of these mechanisms appears to be able to transform the high-redshift Kormendy relation into its local counterpart, leaving the origin and fate of these compact "red nuggets" unresolved.},

  abstract      = {We present a simple theoretical framework for massive galaxies at high redshift, where the main assembly and star formation occurred, and report on the first cosmological simulations that reveal clumpy disks consistent with our analysis. The evolution is governed by the interplay between smooth and clumpy cold streams, disk instability, and bulge formation. Intense, relatively smooth streams maintain an unstable dense gas-rich disk. Instability with high turbulence and giant clumps, each a few percent of the disk mass, is self-regulated by gravitational interactions within the disk. The clumps migrate into a bulge in ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 10 dynamical times, or ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 0.5 Gyr. The cosmological streams replenish the draining disk and prolong the clumpy phase to several Gigayears in a steady state , with comparable masses in disk, bulge, and dark matter within the disk radius. The clumps form stars in dense subclumps following the overall accretion rate, ~100 M ☉ yr –1 , and each clump converts into stars in ~0.5 Gyr. While the clumps coalesce dissipatively to a compact bulge, the star-forming disk is extended because the incoming streams keep the outer disk dense and susceptible to instability and because of angular momentum transport. Passive spheroid-dominated galaxies form when the streams are more clumpy: the external clumps merge into a massive bulge and stir up disk turbulence that stabilize the disk and suppress in situ clump and star formation. We predict a bimodality in galaxy type by z ~ 3, involving giant-clump star-forming disks and spheroid-dominated galaxies of suppressed star formation. After z ~ 1, the disks tend to be stabilized by the dominant stellar disks and bulges. Most of the high- z massive disks are likely to end up as today's early-type galaxies.},

  abstract = {We recently identified a substantial population of galaxies at z > 2 with comparatively red rest-frame optical colors. These distant red galaxies (DRGs) are efficiently selected by the simple observed color criterion J s - K s > 2.3. In this paper we present near-infrared spectroscopy with Keck NIRSPEC of six DRGs with previously measured redshifts 2.4 < z < 3.2, two of which were known to host an active nucleus. We detect continuum emission and emission lines of all observed galaxies. Equivalent widths of Hα in the nonactive galaxies are 20-30 Å, smaller than measured for Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and nearby luminous infrared galaxies and comparable to normal nearby galaxies. The modest equivalent widths imply that the galaxies either have a decreasing star formation rate or are very dusty. Fitting both the photometry and the Hα lines, we find continuum extinction A V = 1-2 mag, ages 1-2.5 Gyr, star formation rates 200-400 M ☉ yr -1 , and stellar masses (1-5) × 10 11 M ☉ for models with constant star formation rates. Models with a declining star formation lead to significantly lower extinction, star formation rates, and ages but similar stellar masses. From [N II ]/Hα ratios we infer that the metallicities are high, 1-1.5 times solar. For four galaxies we can determine line widths from the optical emission lines. The widths are high, ranging from 130 to 240 km s -1 , and by combining data for LBGs and DRGs, we find significant correlations between line width and rest-frame U - V color and between line width and stellar mass. The latter correlation has a similar slope and offset as the "baryonic Tully-Fisher relation" for nearby galaxies. From the line widths and effective radii we infer dynamical masses and mass-to-light ( M / L ) ratios. The median dynamical mass is ~2 × 10 11 M ☉ , supporting the high stellar masses inferred from the photometry. We find that the median M / L V ≈ 0.8( M / L ) ☉ , a factor of ~5 higher than measured for LBGs. We infer from our small sample that DRGs are dustier, more metal-rich, and more massive and have higher ages than z ≈ 3 LBGs of the same rest-frame V -band luminosity. Although their volume density is still uncertain, their high M / L ratios imply that they contribute significantly to the stellar mass density at z ≈ 2.5. As their stellar masses are comparable to those of early-type galaxies, they may have already assembled most of their final mass.},

We use HST grism redshifts and extensive photometry in all five 3D- HST /CANDELS fields, more than doubling the area used previously for such studies, and combine these data with Keck MOSFIRE and NIRSPEC spectroscopy. We first confirm that a population of massive, compact, star-forming galaxies exists at z ≳ 2, using K -band spectroscopy of 25 of these objects at 2.0 < z < 2.5. They have a median [N ii ]/H α ratio of 0.6, are highly obscured with SFR(tot)/SFR(H α ) ∼10, and have a large range of observed line widths. We infer from the kinematics and spatial distribution of H α that the galaxies have rotating disks of ionized gas that are a factor of ∼2 more extended than the stellar distribution. By combining measurements of individual galaxies, we find that the kinematics are consistent with a nearly Keplerian fall-off from V rot ∼ 500 km s −1 at 1 kpc to V rot ∼ 250 km s −1 at 7 kpc, and that the total mass out to this radius is dominated by the dense stellar component. Next, we study the size and mass evolution of the progenitors of compact massive galaxies. Even though individual galaxies may have had complex histories with periods of compaction and mergers, we show that the population of progenitors likely followed a simple inside-out growth track in the size–mass plane of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/813/1/23/apj520554ieqn1.gif] {${\rm{\Delta }}\mathrm{log}{r}_{{\rm{e}}}\sim 0.3{\rm{\Delta }}\mathrm{log}{M}_{{\rm{stars}}}.$} This mode of growth gradually increases the stellar mass within a fixed physical radius, and galaxies quench when they reach a stellar density or velocity dispersion threshold.

The sample is selected at a constant number density of n = 2 × 10 –4  Mpc –3 , so that galaxies at different epochs can be compared in a meaningful way. We show that the stellar mass of galaxies at this number density has increased by a factor of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 2 since z = 2, following the relation log M n ( z ) = 11.45 – 0.15 z . In order to determine at what physical radii this mass growth occurred, we construct very deep stacked rest-frame R -band images of galaxies with masses near M n ( z ), at redshifts ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lang.gif] {lang} z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rang.gif] {rang} = 0.6, 1.1, 1.6, and 2.0. These image stacks of typically 70-80 galaxies enable us to characterize the stellar distribution to surface brightness limits of ~28.5 mag arcsec –2 . We find that massive galaxies gradually built up their outer regions over the past 10 Gyr. The mass within a radius of r = 5 kpc is nearly constant with redshift, whereas the mass at 5 kpc < r < 75 kpc has increased by a factor of ~4 since z = 2. Parameterizing the surface brightness profiles, we find that the effective radius and Sersic n parameter evolve as r e ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} (1 + z ) –1.3 and n ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} (1 + z ) –1.0 , respectively. The data demonstrate that massive galaxies have grown mostly inside-out, assembling their extended stellar halos around compact, dense cores with possibly exponential radial density distributions. Comparing the observed mass evolution to the average star formation rates of the galaxies we find that the growth is likely dominated by mergers, as in situ star formation can only account for ~20% of the mass buildup from z = 2 to z = 0. A direct consequence of these results is that massive galaxies do not evolve in a self-similar way: their structural profiles change as a function of redshift, complicating analyses which (often implicitly) assume self-similarity. The main uncertainties in this study are possible redshift-dependent systematic errors in the total stellar masses and the conversion from light-weighted to mass-weighted radial profiles.},

We find a large population of massive young recently quenched ("post-starburst") galaxies at z > 1 that are almost non-existent at z < 1; their number density is 5 × 10 –5 Mpc –3 at z = 2, whereas it is a factor of 10 less at z = 0.5. The observed number densities of young and old quiescent galaxies at z > 1 are consistent with a simple model in which all old quiescent galaxies were once identified as post-starburst galaxies. We find that the overall population of quiescent galaxies have smaller sizes and slightly more elongated shapes at higher redshift, in agreement with other recent studies. Interestingly, the most recently quenched galaxies at 1 < z < 2 are not larger, and possibly even smaller, than older galaxies at those redshifts. This result is inconsistent with the idea that the evolution of the average size of quiescent galaxies is largely driven by continuous transformations of larger, star-forming galaxies: in that case, the youngest quiescent galaxies would also be the largest. Instead, mergers or other mechanisms appear to be required to explain the size growth of quiescent galaxies from z = 2 to the present.},

Our main results can be summarized as follows: (i) the slope of the star-formation rate– M * correlation is consistent with being constant ≃0.8 up to z ≃ 1.5, while its normalization keeps increasing with redshift; (ii) for the first time we are able to explore the FIR–radio correlation for a mass-selected sample of star-forming galaxies: the correlation does not evolve up to z ≃ 4; (iii) we confirm that galaxy stellar mass is a robust proxy for UV dust attenuation in star-forming galaxies, with more massive galaxies being more dust attenuated. Strikingly, we find that this attenuation relation evolves very weakly with redshift, with the amount of dust attenuation increasing by less than 0.3 mag over the redshift range [0.5–4] for a fixed stellar mass; (iv) the correlation between dust attenuation and the UV spectral slope evolves with redshift, with the median UV slope becoming bluer with redshift. By z ≃ 3, typical UV slopes are inconsistent, given the measured dust attenuations, with the predictions of commonly used empirical laws. (v) Finally, building on existing results, we show that gas reddening is marginally larger (by a factor of around 1.3) than the stellar reddening at all redshifts probed. Our results support a scenario where the ISM conditions of typical star-forming galaxies evolve with redshift, such that at z ≥ 1.5 Main Sequence galaxies have ISM conditions moving closer to those of local starbursts.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift are much more compact than present-day galaxies of the same mass. Here we compare the radial stellar density profiles and the number density of a sample of massive galaxies at z ~ 2.3 to nearby massive elliptical galaxies. We confirm that the average stellar densities of the z ~ 2.3 galaxies within the effective radius, ρ(< r e ), are two orders of magnitude higher than those of local elliptical galaxies of the same stellar mass. However, we also find that the densities measured within a constant physical radius of 1 kpc, ρ(<1 kpc), are higher by a factor of 2-3 only. This suggests that inside-out growth scenarios are plausible, in which the compact high-redshift galaxies make up the centers of normal nearby ellipticals. The compact galaxies are common at high redshift, which enables us to further constrain their evolution by requiring that the number density of their descendants does not exceed constraints imposed by the z = 0 galaxy mass function. We infer that size growth must be efficient, with ( r 1+2 / r 1 ) ~ ( M 1+2 / M 1 ) 2 . A simple model where compact galaxies with masses ~10 11 M ☉ primarily grow through minor mergers produces descendants with the approximate sizes, stellar densities, and number density of elliptical galaxies with masses 2-3 × 10 11 M ☉ in the local universe. We note that this model also predicts evolution in the M BH – σ relation, such that the progenitors of elliptical galaxies have lower black hole masses at fixed velocity dispersion. The main observational uncertainty is the conversion from light to mass; measurements of kinematics are needed to calibrate the masses and stellar densities of the high-redshift galaxies.},

  abstract      = {Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting in the far-infrared (FIR) is greatly limited by a dearth of data and an excess of free parameters - from galaxies' dust composition, temperature, mass, orientation, opacity, to heating from active galactic nuclei (AGN). This paper presents a simple FIR SED fitting technique joining a modified, single dust temperature greybody, representing the reprocessed starburst emission in the whole galaxy, to a mid-infrared (MIR) power law, which approximates hot-dust emission from AGN heating or clumpy, hot starbursting regions. This FIR SED can be used to measure IR luminosities, dust temperatures and dust masses for both local and high-z galaxies with three to 10+ FIR photometric measurements. While the fitting technique does not model emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the MIR, the impact of PAH features on integrated FIR properties is negligible when compared to the bulk emission at longer wavelengths.  This fitting method is compared to IR template SEDs in the literature using photometric data on 65 local luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies, (U)LIRGs. Despite relying only on 2-4 free parameters, the coupled greybody/power-law SED fitting described here produces better fits to photometric measurements than best-fitting literature template SEDs (with residuals a factor of {\tilde}2 lower). A mean emissivity index of {$\beta$} = 1.60 {\plusmn} 0.38 and MIR power-law slope of {$\alpha$} = 2.0 {\plusmn} 0.5 is measured; the former agrees with the widely presumed emissivity index of {$\beta$} = 1.5 and the latter is indicative of an optically thin dust medium with a shallow radial density profile, {\ap}r$^{-1/2}$. Adopting characteristic dust temperature as the inverse wavelength where the SED peaks, dust temperatures {\tilde}25-45 K are measured for local (U)LIRGs, {\tilde}5-15 K colder than previous estimates using only simple greybodies. This comparative study highlights the impact of SED fitting assumptions on the measurement of physical properties such as IR luminosity (and thereby IR-based star formation rate), dust temperature and dust mass, for both local and high-redshift galaxies.},

We also find that cSFGs have distributions similar to cQGs on the nonparametric morphology diagrams. The cQGs and cSFGs have larger Gini and smaller M 20 , while eSFGs have the reverse. About one-third of cSFGs show signatures of postmergers, and almost none of them can be recognized as disks. Moreover, those visually extended cSFGs all have lower Gini coefficients ( Gini < 0.4), indicating that the Gini coefficient could be used to clean out noncompact galaxies in a sample of candidate cSFGs. The X-ray-detected counterparts are more frequent among cSFGs than in eSFGs and cQGs, implying that cSFGs have previously experienced violent gas-richinteractions (such as major mergers or disk instabilities), which could trigger both star formation and black hole growth in an active phase.},

After necessary spectral stacking of the relatively faint objects in our initial sample of 40 UCDs and 118 GCs, we obtain 30 sets of Lick-index measurements for UCDs and 80 for GCs. The M87 UCDs have ages $\gtrsim$ 8 Gyr and [$\alpha$/Fe] $\simeq$ 0.4 dex, in agreement with previous studies based on smaller samples. The literature UCDs, located in lower-density environments than M87, extend to younger ages and smaller [$\alpha$/Fe] (at given metallicities) than M87 UCDs, resembling the environmental dependence of the Virgo dE nuclei. The UCDs exhibit a positive mass-metallicity relation (MZR), which flattens and connects compact ellipticals at stellar masses $\gtrsim$ 10$^{8}$ $M\_{\odot}$. The Virgo dE nuclei largely follow the average MZR of UCDs, whereas most of the M87 GCs are offset towards higher metallicities for given stellar masses. The difference between the mass-metallicity distributions of UCDs and GCs may be qualitatively understood as a result of their different physical sizes at birth in a self-enrichment scenario or of galactic nuclear cluster star formation efficiency being relatively low in a tidal stripping scenario for UCD formation. The existing observations provide the necessary but not sufficient evidence for tidally stripped dE nuclei being the dominant contributors to the M87 UCDs.},

If such high ionization features are shown to be common, it may indicate that extreme radiation fields play a role in regulating the visibility of Lyman-alpha in the reionization era. Here we present deep near-infrared spectra of seven galaxies with Lyman-alpha emission at 5.4$\lt$z$\lt$8.7 (including a newly-confirmed lensed galaxy at z=6.031) and three bright z$\gt$7 photometric targets. In nine sources we do not detect UV metal lines. However in the z=8.683 galaxy EGSY8p7, we detect a 4.6 sigma emission line in the narrow spectral window expected for NV 1243. The feature is unresolved (FWHM$\lt$90 km/s) and is likely nebular in origin. A deep H-band spectrum of EGSY8p7 reveals non-detections of CIV, He II, and OIII]. The presence of NV requires a substantial flux of photons above 77 eV, pointing to a hard ionizing spectrum powered by an AGN or fast radiative shocks. Regardless of its origin, the intense radiation field of EGSY8p7 may aid the transmission of Lyman-alpha through what is likely a partially neutral IGM. With this new detection, five of thirteen known Lyman-alpha emitters at z$\gt$7 have now been shown to have intense UV line emission, suggesting that extreme radiation fields are commonplace among the Lyman-alpha population. Future observations with JWST will eventually clarify the origin of these features and explain their role in the visibility of Lyman-alpha in the reionization era.},

  abstract      = {(abridged) In the hunt for rare time-domain events, confusing exotic extragalactic phenomena with more common Galactic foreground events is an important consideration. We show how observations from multiple wavebands, in this case optical and X-ray observations, can be used to facilitate the distinction between the two. We discovered an extremely bright and rapid transient event in optical observations of M31 with the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF). The persistent optical counterpart of this transient was previously thought to be a variable star in M31 without any dramatic flux excursions. The iPTF event initially appeared to be an extraordinarily rapid and energetic extragalactic transient, a very fast nova in M31 being one of the exciting possibilities, with a \~{}3mag positive flux excursion in less than a kilosecond. The nature of the source was resolved with the help of Chandra archival data, where we found an X-ray counterpart and obtained its X-ray spectrum. We find the X-ray spectrum of the quiescent emission can be described by a model of optically thin plasma emission with a temperature of \~{}7MK, typical for coronal emission from an active star. The combination of the X-ray luminosity, calculated assuming the source is located in M31 (\~{}3.10\^{}36 erg/s), and the color temperature exclude any type of known accreting compact object or active star in M31. We argue instead that the optical transient source is an M type main-sequence, active star located in the disk of the Milky Way at a distance of \~{}0.5-1 kpc. Its persistent X-ray luminosity is in the \~{}(1.3-5).10\^{}30 erg/s range and it has the absolute optical magnitude of 9.5-11.0 mag in R-band. The observed optical flare has the equivalent duration of \~{}95min and total energy of \~{}(0.3-1).10\^{}35 erg in R-band, which places it among the brightest flares ever observed from an M-type star.},

Since supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in IR-bright DOGs are expected to be rapidly growing in the major merger scenario, they provide useful clues to understand the co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies. However the optical properties of IR-bright DOGs are still unclear, because the optical emission of DOGs is very faint. By combining \~{} 53 deg\^{}2 images of the optical, near-IR, and mid-IR data that are obtained with the Subaru Hyper Suprime Cam (HSC) survey, VISTA VIKING survey, and WISE all-sky survey, respectively, 427 IR-bright DOGs are selected. We find that IR-bright DOGs show a redder (g-z)\_AB color than other populations of dusty galaxies such as ultra-luminous IR galaxies (ULIRGs) at a similar redshift, with a significantly large dispersion. Among the selected DOGs, star-formation (SF)-dominated DOGs show a relatively red color while active galactic nucleus (AGN)-dominated DOGs show a rather blue color in optical. This result is consistent with the idea that the relative AGN contribution in the optical emission becomes more significant at a late stage in the major merger scenario. Roughly 2\% of AGN-dominated DOGs show a significant blue excess in blue HSC bands (BluDOGs), which can be interpreted as a leaked AGN emission as proposed for some blue-excess Hot DOGs in earlier works.},

Most numerical studies, however, tend to focus on the effects of the former with little work done on those of the latter. We thus perform a numerical study on the evolution of a late-type galaxy interacting with neighboring early-type galaxies at high speed, using hydrodynamic simulations. Based on the information obtained from the Coma cluster, we set up the simulations for the case where a Milky Way-like late-type galaxy experiences six consecutive collisions with twice as massive early-type galaxies having hot gas in their halos at the closest approach distances of 15-65 kpc/h at the relative velocities of 1500-1600 km/s. Our simulations show that the evolution of the late-type galaxy can be significantly affected by the accumulated effects of the high-speed multiple collisions with the early-type galaxies, such as on cold gas content and star formation activity of the late-type galaxy, particularly through the hydrodynamic interactions between cold disk and hot gas halos. We find that the late-type galaxy can lose most of its cold gas after the six collisions and have more star formation activity during the collisions. By comparing our simulation results with those of galaxy-cluster interactions, we claim that the role of the galaxy-galaxy interactions on the evolution of late-type galaxies in clusters could be comparable with that of the galaxy-cluster interactions, depending on the dynamical history.},

This quasar was identified as part of the KiDS-VIKING Red Quasar (KV-RQ) survey, specifically aimed at targeting dusty absorbers which may cause the background quasars to escape the optical selection of e.g. the SDSS quasar survey. For the DLA we find an HI column density of $\log N$(HI) = $21.2\pm 0.1$ and a metallicity of [X/H] = $-0.90\pm 0.20$ derived from an empirical relation based on the equivalent width of SiII$\lambda$1526. We observe a total visual extinction of $A\_V=0.16$ mag induced by both absorbers. We compile a sample of 17 additional dusty ($A\_V \gt 0.1$ mag) DLAs toward quasars (QSO-DLAs) from the literature for which we characterize the properties of HI column density, metallicity and dust. From this sample we also estimate a correction factor to the overall DLA metallicity budget. We demonstrate that the dusty QSO-DLAs have high metal column densities ($\log N$(HI) + [X/H]) and are more similar to gamma-ray burst (GRB)-selected DLAs (GRB-DLAs) than regular QSO-DLAs. We evaluate the effect of dust reddening in DLAs as well as illustrate how the induced color excess of the underlying quasars can be significant (up to $\sim 1$ mag in various optical bands), even for low to moderate extinction values ($A\_V \lesssim 0.6$ mag). Finally we discuss the direct and indirect implications of a significant dust bias in both QSO- and GRB-DLA samples. [Abridged]},

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) are helping to cement the idea that close companion stars form via fragmentation of a gravitationally unstable disk around a protostar early in the star formation process. As the disk grows in mass, it eventually becomes gravitationally unstable and fragments, forming one or more new protostars in orbit with the first at mean separations of 100 astronomical units (AU) or even less. Here we report direct numerical calculations down to scales as small as $\sim 0.1$ AU, using a consistent Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code, that show the large-scale fragmentation of a cloud core into two protostars accompanied by small-scale fragmentation of their circumstellar disks. Our results demonstrate the two dominant mechanisms of star formation, where the disk forming around a protostar, which in turn results from the large-scale fragmentation of the cloud core, undergoes eccentric ($m=1$) fragmentation to produce a close binary. We generate two-dimensional emission maps and simulated ALMA 1.3 mm continuum images of the structure and fragmentation of the disks that can help explain the dynamical processes occurring within collapsing cloud cores.},

The catalog contains 6617 objects with high-quality spectra (two or more spectral features), and 1798 objects with a single spectroscopic feature confirmed by the photometric redshift. For 2024 typically faint objects we could not obtain reliable redshifts. The objects have been selected from a variety of input catalogs based on multi-wavelength observations in the field, and thus have a diverse selection function, which enables the study of the diversity in the galaxy population. The magnitude distribution of our objects is peaked at I\_AB\~{}23 and K\_AB\~{}21, with a secondary peak at K\_AB\~{}24. We sample a broad redshift distribution in the range 0$\lt$z$\lt$6, with one peak at z\~{}1, and another one around z\~{}4. We have identified 13 redshift spikes at z$\gt$0.65 with chance probabilities $\lt$4xE-4$, some of which are clearly related to protocluster structures of sizes \gt10 Mpc. An object-to-object comparison with a multitude of other spectroscopic samples in the same field shows that our DEIMOS sample is among the best in terms of fraction of spectroscopic failures and relative redshift accuracy. We have determined the fraction of spectroscopic blends to about 0.8\% in our sample. This is likely a lower limit and at any rate well below the most pessimistic expectations. Interestingly, we find evidence for strong lensing of Ly-alpha background emitters within the slits of 12 of our target galaxies, increasing their apparent density by about a factor of 4.},

The hot X-ray emitting halos are detected to 50-70 kpc, where typically, M\_hot($\lt$50 kpc) \~{} 5E9 Msun, and with density n $\backslash$propto r\^{}-3/2. When extrapolated to R200, the gas mass is comparable to the stellar mass, but about half of the baryons are still missing from the hot phase. If extrapolated to 1.9-3 R200, the baryon to dark matter ratio approaches the cosmic value. Significantly flatter density profiles are unlikely for R $\lt$ 50 kpc and they are disfavored but not ruled out for R $\gt$ 50 kpc. For the Milky Way, the hot halo metallicity lies in the range 0.3-1 solar for R $\lt$ 50 kpc. Planck measurements of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect toward stacked luminous galaxies (primarily early-type) indicate that most of their baryons are hot, near the virial temperature, and extend beyond R200. This stacked SZ signal is nearly an order of magnitude larger than that inferred from the X-ray observations of individual (mostly spiral) galaxies with M\_* $\gt$ 10\^{}11.3 Msun. This difference suggests that the hot halo properties are distinct for early and late type galaxies, possibly due to different evolutionary histories. For the cooler gas detected in UV absorption line studies, we argue that there are two absorption populations: extended halos; and disks extending to \~{}50 kpc, containing most of this gas, and with masses a few times lower than the stellar masses. Such extended disks are also seen in 21 cm HI observations and in simulations.},

Numerical studies of the f ormation of CDM halos have produced several robust results that allow unique  tests of the hierarchical clustering paradigm. Universal properties of halos,  including their mass profiles and substructure properties are roughly  consistent with observational data from the scales of dwarf galaxies to galaxy  clusters. Resolving the fine grained structure of halos has enabled us to make  predictions for ongoing and planned direct and indirect dark matter detection  experiments. While simulations of pure CDM halos are now very accurate and in  good agreement (recently claimed discrepancies are addressed in detail in this  review), we are still unable to make robust, quantitative predictions about  galaxy formation and about how the dark matter distribution changes in the  process. Whilst discrepancies between observations and simulations have  been  the subject of much debate in the literature, galaxy formation and evolution  needs to be understood in more detail in order to fully test the CDM paradigm.  Whatever the true nature of the dark matter particle is, its clustering  properties must not be too different from a cold neutralino like particle to  maintain all the successes of the model in matching large scale structure data  and the global properties of halos which are mostly in good agreement with  observations.},

After two years of commissioning beginning in 2009, the telescope, instruments, software systems and operations are nearly ready to begin the main science survey. Through a spectral survey of millions of objects in much of the northern sky, LAMOST will enable research in a number of contemporary cutting edge topics in astrophysics, such as discovery of the first generation stars in the Galaxy, pinning down the formation and evolution history of galaxies {\mdash} especially the Milky Way and its central massive black hole, and looking for signatures of the distribution of dark matter and possible sub-structures in the Milky Way halo. To maximize the scientific potential of the facility, wide national participation and international collaboration have been emphasized. The survey has two major components: the LAMOST ExtraGAlactic Survey (LEGAS) and the LAMOST Experiment for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (LEGUE). Until LAMOST reaches its full capability, the LEGUE portion of the survey will use the available observing time, starting in 2012. An overview of the LAMOST project and the survey that will be carried out in the next five to six years is presented in this paper. The science plan for the whole LEGUE survey, instrumental specifications, site conditions, and the descriptions of the current on-going pilot survey, including its footprints and target selection algorithm, will be presented as separate papers in this volume.},

  abstract = {The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer ( WISE ) satellite observed the full sky in four mid-infrared bands in the 2.8-28 μ m range. The primary mission was completed in 2010. The WISE team has done a superb job of producing a series of high-quality, well-documented, complete data releases in a timely manner. However, the "Atlas Image" coadds that are part of the recent AllWISE and previous data releases were intentionally blurred. Convolving the images by the point-spread function while coadding results in "matched-filtered" images that are close to optimal for detecting isolated point sources. But these matched-filtered images are sub-optimal or inappropriate for other purposes. For example, we are photometering the WISE images at the locations of sources detected in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey through forward modeling, and this blurring decreases the available signal-to-noise by effectively broadening the point-spread function. This paper presents a new set of coadds of the WISE images that have not been blurred. These images retain the intrinsic resolution of the data and are appropriate for photometry preserving the available signal-to-noise. Users should be cautioned, however, that the W 3- and W 4-band coadds contain artifacts around large, bright structures (large galaxies, dusty nebulae, etc.); eliminating these artifacts is the subject of ongoing work. These new coadds, and the code used to produce them, are publicly available at http://unwise.me [http://unwise.me] .},

  abstract = {We present photometry of images from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer ( WISE ) of over 400 million sources detected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We use a “forced photometry” technique, using measured SDSS source positions, star–galaxy classification, and galaxy profiles to define the sources whose fluxes are to be measured in the WISE images. We perform photometry with The Tractor image modeling code, working on our “unWISE” coaddds and taking account of the WISE point-spread function and a noise model. The result is a measurement of the flux of each SDSS source in each WISE band. Many sources have little flux in the WISE bands, so often the measurements we report are consistent with zero given our uncertainties. However, for many sources we get 3 σ or 4 σ measurements; these sources would not be reported by the “official” WISE pipeline and will not appear in the WISE catalog, yet they can be highly informative for some scientific questions. In addition, these small-signal measurements can be used in stacking analyses at the catalog level. The forced photometry approach has the advantage that we measure a consistent set of sources between SDSS and WISE , taking advantage of the resolution and depth of the SDSS images to interpret the WISE images; objects that are resolved in SDSS but blended together in WISE still have accurate measurements in our photometry. Our results, and the code used to produce them, are publicly available at http://unwise.me [http://unwise.me] .},

  abstract      = {In our previous work, we found that only two scenarios are capable of reproducing the observed integrated mass-metallicity relations for the gas and stellar components of local star-forming galaxies simultaneously. One scenario invokes a time-dependent metal outflow loading factor with stronger outflows at early times. The other scenario uses a time-dependent initial mass function (IMF) slope with a steeper IMF at early times. In this work, we extend our study to investigate the radial profile of gas and stellar metallicity in local star-forming galaxies using spatially resolved spectroscopic data from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. We find that most galaxies show negative gradients in both gas and stellar metallicity with steeper gradients in stellar metallicity. The stellar metallicity gradients tend to be mass dependent with steeper gradients in more massive galaxies while no clear mass dependence is found for the gas metallicity gradient. Then we compare the observations with the predictions from a chemical evolution model of the radial profiles of gas and stellar metallicities. We confirm that the two scenarios proposed in our previous work are also required to explain the metallicity gradients. Based on these two scenarios, we successfully reproduce the radial profiles of gas metallicity, stellar metallicity, stellar mass surface density, and star formation rate surface density simultaneously. The origin of the negative gradient in stellar metallicity turns out to be driven by either radially dependent metal outflow or IMF slope. In contrast, the radial dependence of the gas metallicity is less constrained because of the degeneracy in model parameters.},

The roles of secular and environmental quenching processes are investigated by studying the dependence of the radial profiles of specific star formation rate on stellar mass, galaxy structure, and environment. We report on the existence of `centrally suppressed' galaxies, which have suppressed Specific Star Formation Rate (SSFR) in their cores compared to their discs. The profiles of centrally suppressed and unsuppressed galaxies are distributed in a bimodal way. Galaxies with high stellar mass and core velocity dispersion are found to be much more likely to be centrally suppressed than low-mass galaxies, and we show that this is related to morphology and the presence of AGN/LI(N)ER like emission. Centrally suppressed galaxies also display lower star formation at all radii compared to unsuppressed galaxies. The profiles of central and satellite galaxies are also compared, and we find that satellite galaxies experience lower specific star formation rates at all radii than central galaxies. This uniform suppression could be a signal of the stripping of hot halo gas in the process known as strangulation. We find that satellites are not more likely to be suppressed in their cores than centrals, indicating that the core suppression is an entirely internal process. We find no correlation between the local environment density and the profiles of star formation rate surface density.},

In molecular clouds, stars are formed in cores, gas condensations which are sufficiently dense that gravitational collapse converts a large fraction of their mass into a star or small clutch of stars. In nearby star-formation regions, the core mass function (CMF) is strikingly similar to the IMF, suggesting that the shape of the IMF may simply be inherited from the CMF. Here we present 1.3 mm observations, obtained with ALMA, the world's largest interferometer, of the active star-formation region W43-MM1, which may be more representative of the Galactic-disk regions where most stars form. The unprecedented resolution of these observations reveals, for the first time, a statistically robust CMF at high masses, with a slope that is markedly shallower than the IMF. This seriously challenges our understanding of the origin of the IMF.},

  abstract      = {[abridged] Building upon a previous study, we define a method to blindly identify galaxies that underwent, and may still be undergoing, a fast downfall of their star-formation activity, that is, a more than 80\% drop in star-formation rate (SFR) occurring in less than 500 Myr. Modeling galaxies' SED with a delayed-$\tau$ star formation history (SFH), with and without allowing an instantaneous SFR drop within the last hundreds Myr, we isolate 102 candidates out of a subsample of 6,680 galaxies classified as star-forming from the UVJ criterion in the ZFOURGE catalogues. These galaxies are mostly located in the lower part of the SFR-M$\_*$ main sequence (MS) and extend up to a factor 100 below it. They also lie close to the limit between the passive and active regions on the UVJ diagram, indicating that they are in a transition phase. We show that the selected candidates have different physical properties compared to galaxies with similar UVJ colors, namely, lower star-formation rates and different stellar masses. The morphology of the candidates show no preference for a particular type. Among the 102 candidates, only 4 show signs of an AGN activity (from X-ray luminosity or UV-IR SED fitting decomposition). This low fraction of AGNs among the candidates implies that AGN activity may not be the main driver of the recent downfall, although timescale differences and duty cycle must be taken into account. We finally attempt to recover the past position of these galaxies on the SFR-M$\_*$ plane, before the downfall of their star-formation and show that some of them were in the starburst region before and are back on the MS. These candidates constitute a promising sample that need more investigation in order to understand the different mechanisms at the origin of the star formation decrease of the Universe since $z$$\sim$2.},

  abstract      = {The low column density gas at the outskirts of galaxies as traced by the 21 cm hydrogen line emission (HI) represents the interface between galaxies and the intergalactic medium, i.e., where galaxies are believed to get their supply of gas to fuel future episodes of star formation. Photoionization models predict a break in the radial profiles of HI at a column density of 5x10E+19 cm\^{}-2 due to the lack of self-shielding against extragalactic ionizing photons. To investigate the prevalence of such breaks in galactic disks and to characterize what determines the potential ``edge'' of the HI disks, we study the azimuthally-averaged HI column density profiles of 17 nearby galaxies from The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS) and supplemented in two cases with published Hydrogen Accretion in LOcal GAlaxieS (HALOGAS) data. To detect potential faint HI emission that would otherwise be undetected using conventional moment map analysis, we line up individual profiles to the same reference velocity and average them azimuthally to derive stacked radial profiles. To do so, we use model velocity fields created from a simple extrapolation of the rotation curves to align the profiles in velocity at radii beyond the extent probed with the sensitivity of traditional integrated HI maps. With this method, we improve our sensitivity to outer-disk HI emission by up to an order of magnitude. Except for a few disturbed galaxies, none show evidence for a sudden change in the slope of the HI radial profiles, the alleged signature of ionization by the extragalactic background.},

A wealth of information can be obtained from their spectral analysis of the emission lines and the stellar continuum. Considering these, we proposed a long-term project ``Spectroscopic Observations of the Star Formation Regions in Nearby Galaxies''. The primary goal of this project is to observe spectroscopy of star formation regions in 20 nearby galaxies, with the NAOC 2.16 m telescope and the Hectospec/MMT multifiber spectrograph. With the spectra of a large sample of star formation regions, combining multi-wavelength data from UV to IR, we can investigate, understand and quantify the dust extinction, star formation rate, metal abundance, and the two-dimensional distributions of stellar population properties of nearby galaxies. It will be important for a better understanding of galaxy formation. Here we report on the observations, data reduction, and analysis of the spectra of \~{} 400 star formation regions in M33, via multifiber spectroscopy with Hectospec at the MMT.},

  abstract      = {We present a study on physical properties for a large distant red galaxy (DRG) sample, using the K-selected multi-band photometry catalog of the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field and the CANDELS near-infrared data. Our sample includes 4485 DRGs with (J - K)$_{AB}$ $\gt$ 1.16 and K$_{AB}$ $\lt$ 23.4 mag, and 132 DRGs have HST/WFC3 morphological measurements. The results of nonparametric measurements of DRG morphology are consistent with our rest-frame UVJ color classification; quiescent DRGs are generally compact while star-forming DRGs tend to have extended structures. We find the star formation rate (SFR) and the stellar mass of star-forming DRGs present tight ``main sequence'' relations in all redshift bins. Moreover, the specific SFR (sSFR) of DRGs increases with redshift in all stellar mass bins and DRGs with higher stellar masses generally have lower sSFRs, which indicates that galaxies were much more active on average in the past, and star formation contributes more to the mass growth of low-mass galaxies than to high-mass galaxies. The infrared-derived SFR dominates the total SFR of DRGs which occupy the high-mass range, implying that the J - K color criterion effectively selects massive and dusty galaxies. DRGs with higher M$_{*}$ generally have redder (U - V)$_{rest}$ colors, and the (U - V)$_{rest}$ colors of DRGs become bluer at higher redshifts, suggesting high-mass galaxies have higher internal dust extinctions or older stellar ages and they evolve with time. Finally, we find that DRGs have different overlap among extremely red objects, BzK galaxies, IRAC-selected extremely red objects, and high-z ultraluminous infrared galaxies, indicating that DRGs are not a special population and they can also be selected by other color criteria.},

The BCD sample is selected from the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey in the Great observatories origins Deep Survey North and South fields. We extract the surface brightness profile (SBP) in the optical F435W and NIR F160W bands. The SBPs of BCDs in the H band reach {\tilde}26 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ at the 3{$\sigma$} level, which is so far the deepest NIR imaging of BCDs. Then we fit the SBPs with one- and two-component S{\'e}rsic models. About half of the BCDs favour the two-component model which significantly improves the fit quality. The effective radii of the underlying hosts of BCDs in the B band are smaller than those of early-type dwarfs (dEs) and dwarf irregulars at a fixed luminosity. This discrepancy is similar to findings in many previous works. However, the difference in structural parameters between BCDs and other dwarf galaxies seems to be less significant in the H band. Furthermore, we find a remarkable agreement between the underlying hosts of BCDs and dEs. All dwarf galaxies seem to follow a similar luminosity-radius relationship which suggests a unified structural evolution for dwarf galaxies. We conclude that a possible evolution track from BCDs to dEs cannot be ruled out, with no significant change of structure needed in the evolutionary scenario.},

The differential number counts of sBzKs and pBzKs are consistent with the results from the literature. Compared to the observed results, semi-analytic models of galaxy formation and evolution provide too few (many) galaxies at the high (low) mass end. Moreover, we find that the star formation rate and stellar mass of sBzKs follow the relation of the main sequence. Based on HST/Wide Field Camera 3 F160W imaging, we find a wide range of morphological diversities for sBzKs, from diffuse to early-type spiral structures, with relatively high M$_{20}$, large size and low G, while pBzKs have elliptical-like compact morphologies with lower M$_{20}$, smaller size and higher G, indicating a more concentrated and symmetric spatial extent of stellar population distribution in pBzKs than sBzKs. Furthermore, the sizes of pBzKs (sBzKs) at z {\sim} 2 are on average two to three (one to two) times smaller than those of local early-type (late-type) galaxies with similar stellar mass. Our findings imply that the two classes have different evolution models and mass assembly histories.  Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China.},

For a given stellar mass, we find that the mean size of OGs (DGs) is smaller by a factor of {\sim} 2 (1.5) than that of present-day early-type (late-type) galaxies at a rest-frame optical wavelength. We derive the average effective radii of OGs and DGs, corresponding to 2.09 {\plusmn} 1.13 kpc and 3.27 {\plusmn} 1.14 kpc, respectively. Generally, the DGs are heterogeneous, with mixed features including bulges, disks and irregular structures, with relatively high M$_{20}$, large size and low G. By contrast, OGs have elliptical-like compact morphologies with lower M$_{20}$, smaller size and higher G, indicating a more concentrated and symmetric spatial extent of the stellar population distribution in OGs than DGs. These findings imply that OGs and DGs have different evolutionary processes, and that the minor merger scenario is the most likely mechanism for the structural properties of OGs. However, the size evolution of DGs is possibly due to the secular evolution of galaxies.  Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China.},

We find a wide range of morphological diversity for these ULIRGs, from ellipsoids to multiple bright nuclei or diffuse structures, e.g., the double nuclei, gaseous bridges, dual asym- metries, irregular or elliptical structures. In order to study the morphology of these ULIRGs quantitatively, their morphological parameters (the Gini coeffcient G and moment index M$_{20}$) are measured in the rest-frame optical wave- band. Compared with the low-redshift counterparts, the high-redshift ULIRGs show a smaller value of G and a larger value of M$_{20}$, indicating a less concen- tricity and a larger asymmetry of the stellar population distribution in these ULIRGs. Based on a 2-D fitting of the brightness profiles of these ULIRGs, we have derived their effective radii, which are distributed in a range from 2.4 to kpc, with a mean value of (3.9 {\plusmn} 1.1) kpc. Moreover, we find that in average the sizes of the high-redshift ULIRGs are one to two times smaller than those of the nearby star-forming galaxies of analogous stellar mass.

More than half of the ETGs are blue-cored and have remarkable positive NUV - r color gradients, suggesting that their star formations are centrally concentrated. The rest have flat color distributions out to R $_{90}$. The centrally concentrated star formation activity in a large portion of ETGs is confirmed by the SDSS spectroscopy, showing that \~{}50\% of the ETGs have EW(H{$\alpha$}) $\gt$6.0 {\AA}. Of the LTGs, 95\% show uniform radial color profiles, which can be interpreted as a red bulge plus an extended blue disk. The links between the two kinds of ETGs, e.g., those objects having remarkable ``blue-cores'' and those having flat color gradients, are less known and require future investigations. It is suggested that the LTGs follow a general model by which quenching first occurs in the core regions, and then finally extend to the rest of the galaxy. Our results can be re-examined and have important implications for the IFU surveys, such as MaNGA and SAMI.},

Up to z $\lt$ 4, the mass-normalized size evolution can be described by r$_{e}$ vprop(1 + z)$^{-1.0}$. Low S{\'e}rsic index and axis ratio, with median values n \~{}1.5 and b/a \~{} 0.65, respectively, indicate that most of the pVJL galaxies are disk-dominated. Despite large uncertainty, the inner region of the median mass profile of our pVJL galaxies is similar to those of QGs at 0.5 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2.5 and local ETGs. It indicates that local massive ETGs have been formed according to an inside-out scenario: the compact galaxies at high redshift make up the cores of local massive ETGs and then build up the outskirts according to dissipationless minor mergers.},

  abstract      = {We analyse the role of bars in the build-up of central mass concentrations in massive, disc galaxies. Our parent sample consists of 3757 face-on disc galaxies with redshifts between 0.01 and 0.05, selected from the seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. 1555 galaxies with bars are identified using the position angle and ellipticity profiles of the i-band light. We compare the ratio of the specific star formation rate measured in the 1-3 kpc central region of the galaxy to that measured for the whole galaxy. Galaxies with strong bars have centrally enhanced star formation; the degree of enhancement depends primarily on the ellipticity of the bar and not on the size of the bar or on the mass or structure of the host galaxy. The fraction of galaxies with strong bars is highest at stellar masses greater than 3 {\times} 10$^{10}$ M$_{⊙}$, stellar surface densities less than 3 {\times} 10$^{8}$ M$_{⊙}$ and concentration indices less than 2.5. In this region of parameter space, galaxies with strong bars either have enhanced central star formation rates, or star formation that is suppressed compared to the mean. This suggests that bars may play a role in the eventual quenching of star formation in galaxies. Only 50 per cent of galaxies with strongly concentrated star formation have strong bars, indicating that other processes such as galaxy interactions also induce central starbursts. We also find that the ratio of the size of the bar to that of the disc depends mainly on the colour of the galaxy, suggesting that the growth and destruction of bars are regulated by gas accretion, as suggested by simulations.},

This work was enabled by new HST/WFC3 near-IR imaging from the CANDELS survey as well as the deepest available X-ray data from Chandra 4 Ms observations. This sample consists of 133 objects with the 3.6 {$\mu$}m limiting magnitude of [3.6] = 21.5 and is approximately complete for galaxies with M $_{*}$ $\gt$ 10$^{11}$ M $_{⊙}$ at 1.5 $\lt$= z $\lt$= 2.5. We classify this sample into two types, quiescent and star-forming galaxies (SFGs), in the observed infrared color-color ([3.6]-[24] versus K - [3.6]) diagram. The further morphological study of this sample shows a consistent result with the observed color classification. The classified quiescent galaxies are bulge dominated and SFGs in the sample have disk or irregular morphologies. Our observed infrared color classification is also consistent with the rest-frame color (U - V versus V - J) classification. We also found that quiescent and SFGs are well separated in the nonparametric morphology parameter (Gini versus M $_{20}$) diagram measuring their concentration and clumpiness: quiescent galaxies have a Gini coefficient higher than 0.58 and SFGs have a Gini coefficient lower than 0.58. We argue that the star formation quenching process must lead to or be accompanied by the increasing galaxy concentration. One prominent morphological feature of this sample is that disks are commonly seen in this massive galaxy sample at 1.5 $\lt$= z $\lt$= 2.5: 30\% of quiescent galaxies and 70\% of SFGs with M $_{*}$ $\gt$ 10$^{11}$ M $_{⊙}$ have disks in their rest-frame optical morphologies. The prevalence of these extended, relatively undisturbed disks challenges the merging scenario as the main mode of massive galaxy formation.},

The number of counts of pgzKs in our sample turn over at K $_{AB}$ \~{} 21.0, and both the number of faint and bright objects (including sgzKs and pgzKs) exceed the predictions of a recent semi-analytic model of galaxy formation; a more successful model is need to explain this diversity. We also find that the star formation rate (SFR) and specific SFR (sSFR) of sgzKs increases with redshift at all masses, implying that star-forming galaxies were much more active on average in the past. Moreover, the sSFR of massive galaxies is lower at all redshifts, suggesting that star formation contributes more to the mass growth of low-mass galaxies than to high-mass galaxies. From the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 near-infrared imaging data we find that morphologies of z \~{} 2 galaxies not only have diffuse structures with lower G and higher M $_{20}$ values, but also have single-object morphologies (higher G and lower M $_{20}$), implying that there are morphological variety and different formation process for these galaxies at z \~{} 2. Finally, we also study the fraction of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the gzKs, 82 of 828 gzKs with four IRAC bands can be classified as AGNs (\~{}10\%).

The majority of these IEROs are proved to be at 1.4 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2.5 with typical stellar mass of {\tilde} 10$^{11}$Mmsol. In particular, we show that they dominate the high-mass end of the stellar mass function, and contribute {\tilde} 90\% of all the most massive (M$_{*}$ $\gt$ 1 {\times} 10$^{11}$M$_{⊙}$) galaxies at the redshift interval. We show these galaxies can be cleanly separated into old and dusty galaxies using simple H - [8.0] color: the old galaxies primarily have H - [8.0] $\lt$ 1.2 and the dusty galaxies are much redder.  Such a classification scheme is further shown to be broadly consistent with that using MIPS 24 {$\mu$}m, rest-frame U-V and V-J color and SSP fitting.  In addition, with new NIR imaging from HST/WFC3 we show that  these massive old and dusty galaxies exhibit distinct morphologies: the old galaxies are primarily compact and spheroidal whereas the dusty galaxies  show more extended and disturbed morphologies.  With the clean and consistent separation between old and dusty galaxies, we derive the fraction of quiescent massive galaxies to be {\tilde} 25\%, which is the same if we only take the most massive galaxies into account.},

Among the 28 sBzKs observed, H{$\alpha$} emission was detected in 14 objects, and for 11 of them the [N II] {$\lambda$}6583 flux was also measured. Multiwavelength photometry was also used to derive stellar masses and extinction parameters, whereas H{$\alpha$} and [N II] emissions have allowed us to estimate star formation rates (SFRs), metallicities, ionization mechanisms, and dynamical masses. In order to enforce agreement between SFRs from H{$\alpha$} with those derived from rest-frame UV and mid-infrared, additional obscuration for the emission lines (that originate in H II regions) was required compared to the extinction derived from the slope of the UV continuum. We have also derived the stellar mass-metallicity relation, as well as the relation between stellar mass and specific SFR (SSFR), and compared them to the results in other studies. At a given stellar mass, the sBzKs appear to have been already enriched to metallicities close to those of local star-forming galaxies of similar mass. The sBzKs presented here tend to have higher metallicities compared to those of UV-selected galaxies, indicating that near-infrared selected galaxies tend to be a chemically more evolved population. The sBzKs show SSFRs that are systematically higher, by up to \~{}2 orders of magnitude, compared to those of local galaxies of the same mass. The empirical correlations between stellar mass and metallicity, and stellar mass and SSFR are then compared with those of evolutionary population synthesis models constructed either with the simple closed-box assumption, or within an infall scenario. Within the assumptions that are built-in such models, it appears that a short timescale for the star formation (sime100 Myr) and large initial gas mass appear to be required if one wants to reproduce both relations simultaneously.  Based on data collected at the Subaru telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (S04A-081, S05A-098), and on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Paranal, Chile (075.A-0439).},

Our sample includes \~{}5300 EROs with i - K $_{s}$ $\gt$= 2.45 (AB, equivalently I - K $_{s}$ = 4 in Vega) and K $_{s}$ $\lt$= 21.1 (AB). For EROs in our sample, we compute, using the ACS F814W images, their concentration, asymmetry, as well as their Gini coefficient and the second moment of the brightest 20\% of their light. Using those morphology parameters and the Spitzer IRAC [3.6] - [8.0] color, the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting method, we classify EROs into two classes: old galaxies (OGs) and young, dusty starburst galaxies (DGs). We found that the fraction of OGs and DGs in our sample is similar, about 48\% of EROs in our sample are OGs, and 52\% of them are DGs. To reduce the redundancy of these three different classification methods, we performed a principal component analysis on the measurements of EROs, and find that morphology parameters and SEDs are efficient in segregating OGs and DGs. The [3.6] - [8.0] color, which depends on reddening, redshift, and photometric accuracy, is difficult to separate EROs around the discriminating line between starburst and elliptical. We investigate the dependence of the fraction of EROs on their observational properties, and the results suggest that DGs become increasingly important at fainter magnitudes, redder colors, and higher redshifts. The clustering of the entire EROs, DGs, and OGs was estimated by calculating their correlation function, and we find that the clustering of EROs is much stronger than that of full K-limited samples of galaxies; the clustering amplitude of OGs is a factor of \~{}2 larger than that of DGs.},

We selected EROs using a multi-band photometric catalog down to a KS-band magnitude of {\ap}19.3 (Vega system); 14 EROs were detected in X-rays, corresponding to {\ap}9\% of the overall X-ray source population (149 X-ray sources) and to {\ap}5\% of the ERO population (288). The X-ray emission of all X-ray detected EROs is consistent with that of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) ({\gap} 3.5{\times}10$^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at photometric redshifts z $\gt$ 1), in agreement with previous X-ray observations, with an indication of increasing absorption between the three X-ray brightest EROs and the 11 X-ray faintest EROs. We take advantage of the good spatial resolution and limited background provided by Chandra to place constraints on the population of the X-ray undetected EROs by a stacking analysis. Their stacked emission, whose statistical significance is 5.7{$\sigma$} in the observed 0.5-8 keV band, provides an upper limit to the average intrinsic absorption at z = 1 of 2.5{\times}10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and corresponds to a rest-frame 0.5-8 keV luminosity of 8.9{\times}10$^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We estimate that any accretion-related X-ray emission to the stacked signal is likely {\ldquo}diluted{\rdquo} by emission due to hot gas in normal galaxies and star-formation activity in dust-enshrouded galaxies at high redshift.

By splitting each galaxy into an inner and an outer part, we find that most galaxies show negative gradients in these two colours. We first rule out dust extinction gradient and metallicity gradient as the dominant source for the colour gradient. Then using stellar population models, we explore variations in SFH to explain the colour gradients. As shown by our earlier work, a two-phase SFH consisting of an early secular evolution (growth) phase and a subsequent rapid evolution (quenching) phase is necessary to explain the observed colour distributions among galaxies. We explore two different inside-out growth models and two different inside-out quenching models by varying parameters of the SFH between inner and outer regions of galaxies. Two of the models can explain the observed range of colour gradients in NUV - u and u - i colours. We further distinguish them using an additional constraint provided by the u - i colour gradient distribution, under the assumption of constant galaxy formation rate and a common SFH followed by most galaxies. We find the best model is an inside-out growth model in which the inner region has a shorter e-folding time-scale in the growth phase than the outer region. More spatially resolved UV observations are needed to improve the significance of the result.},

However, at z {\gsim} 7 there are as of yet only three narrowband selected LAEs with spectroscopic confirmations (two at z {\tilde} 6.9-7.0, one at z {\tilde} 7.3), which hinders extensive studies on cosmic reionization and galaxy evolution at this key epoch. We have selected 23 candidate z {\tilde} 6.9 LAEs in COSMOS field with the large area narrowband survey Lyman-Alpha Galaxies at the End of Reionization (LAGER). In this work, we present spectroscopic follow-up observations of 12 candidates using the Inamori Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph on Magellan. For nine of these, the observations are sufficiently deep to detect the expected lines. Ly{$\alpha$} emission lines are identified in six sources (yielding a success rate of 2/3), including three luminous LAEs with Ly{$\alpha$} luminosities of L $_{Lyα }$ {\tilde} 10$^{43.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$, the highest among known spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at {\gsim}7.0. This triples the sample size of spectroscopically confirmed narrowband selected LAEs at z {\gsim} 7, and confirms the bright-end bump in the Ly{$\alpha$} luminosity function we previously derived based on the photometric sample, supporting a patchy reionization scenario. Two luminous LAEs appear physically linked with a projected distance of 1.1 pMpc and velocity difference of {\tilde}170 km s$^{-1}$. They likely sit in a common ionized bubble produced by themselves or with close neighbors, which reduces the intergalactic medium attenuation of Ly{$\alpha$}. A tentative narrow N V {$\lambda$}1240 line is seen in one source, hinting at activity of a central massive black hole with metal-rich line-emitting gas.},

In contrast to normal SF galaxies, the targeted galaxies appear to be smoother and more bulge-dominated and have a smaller size and higher concentration, star formation rate, and gas-phase metallicity as a whole. However, they have a larger size and lower concentration than quiescent galaxies. Unlike the normal SF sample, the targeted sample exhibits a slightly positive gradient of the 4000 {\AA} break and a pronounced negative gradient of H{$\alpha$} equivalent width. Furthermore, the median surface mass density profile is between those of the normal SF and quiescent samples, indicating that the gas accretion of quiescent galaxies is not likely to be the main approach for the outside-in assembly mode. Our results suggest that the targeted galaxies are likely in the transitional phase from normal SF galaxies to quiescent galaxies, with rapid ongoing central stellar mass assembly (or bulge growth). We discuss several possible formation mechanisms for the outside-in mass assembly mode.},

  abstract  = {Star formation quenching is a critical process that drive galaxies evolving from blue star-forming to red passive stage. This rapid quenching process is necessary in galaxy evolution models to explain the galaxy distribution in NUV-optical colour-colour diagrams1,2 and the buildup of red-sequence from z = 1 to z = 03,4,5. Yet, the mechanism of this quenching process is not fully understood and is of hot debate. Many candidate scenarios, such as strangulation due to shock heating in massive halos, AGN feedback or gas stripping due to environmental effect, have been proposed. To differentiate these scenarios, more constraints on the quenching process and thus the potential physical mechanism are badly needed. The first result we show in this poster is the properties of quenching process we obtained from the galaxy distribution in NUV-optical colour-colour diagrams.  Aside from the unclear integrated star formation history (SFH) of galaxies, how the SFH of galaxies varies internally is still poorly understood. One direct probe of the internal variation of SFH is the spatial distribution of colours, i.e. the colour gradient. In the second part of the results of this poster, we explicitly illustrate the definition of 'inside-out growth' and 'inside-out quenching' scenarios and utilize the galaxy distribution in the u-I colour gradients to see which one is more observationally favoured.},

  abstract      = {We present the first results from the ongoing Lyman Alpha Galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization (LAGER) project, which is the largest narrowband survey for z {\tilde} 7 galaxies to date. Using a specially built narrowband filter NB964 for the superb large-area Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the NOAO/CTIO 4 m Blanco telescope, LAGER has collected 34 hr NB964 narrowband imaging data in the 3 deg$^{2}$ COSMOS field. We have identified 23 Ly{$\alpha$} Emitter candidates at z = 6.9 in the central 2-deg$^{2}$ region, where DECam and public COSMOS multi-band images exist. The resulting luminosity function (LF) can be described as a Schechter function modified by a significant excess at the bright end (four galaxies with L $_{Lyα }$ {\tilde} 10$^{43.4±0.2}$ erg s$^{-1}$). The number density at L $_{Lyα }$ {\tilde} 10$^{43.4±0.2}$ erg s$^{-1}$ is little changed from z = 6.6, while at fainter L $_{Lyα }$ it is substantially reduced. Overall, we see a fourfold reduction in Ly{$\alpha$} luminosity density from z = 5.7 to z = 6.9. Combined with a more modest evolution of the continuum UV luminosity density, this suggests a factor of {\tilde}3 suppression of Ly{$\alpha$} by radiative transfer through the z {\tilde} 7 intergalactic medium (IGM). It indicates an IGM neutral fraction of x $_{H I }$ {\tilde} 0.4-0.6 (assuming Ly{$\alpha$} velocity offsets of 100-200 km s$^{-1}$). The changing shape of the Ly{$\alpha$} LF between z {\lsim} 6.6 and z = 6.9 supports the hypothesis of ionized bubbles in a patchy reionization at z {\tilde} 7.},

  abstract      = {The average star formation rate (SFR) in galaxies has been declining since the redshift of 2. A fraction of galaxies quench and become quiescent. We constrain two key properties of the quenching process: the quenching timescale and the quenching rate among galaxies. We achieve this by analyzing the galaxy number density profile in NUV-u color space and the distribution in NUV-u versus u - I color-color diagram with a simple toy-model framework. We focus on galaxies in three mass bins between 10$^{10}$ and 10$^{10.6}$ M $_{⊙}$. In the NUV-u versus u - I color-color diagram, the red u - I galaxies exhibit a different slope from the slope traced by the star-forming galaxies. This angled distribution and the number density profile of galaxies in NUV-u space strongly suggest that the decline of the SFR in galaxies has to accelerate before they turn quiescent. We model this color-color distribution with a two-phase exponential decline star formation history. The models with an e-folding time in the second phase (the quenching phase) of 0.5 Gyr best fit the data. We further use the NUV-u number density profile to constrain the quenching rate among star-forming galaxies as a function of mass. Adopting an e-folding time of 0.5 Gyr in the second phase (or the quenching phase), we found the quenching rate to be 19\%/Gyr, 25\%/Gyr and 33\%/Gyr for the three mass bins. These are upper limits of the quenching rate as the transition zone could also be populated by rejuvenated red-sequence galaxies.},

  abstract = {Observationally, a massive disk galaxy can harbor a bulge component that is comparably inactive as a quiescent galaxy. It has been speculated that the quenched component contained in star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is the reason why the star formation main sequence (MS) has a shallow slope at high masses. In this paper, we present a toy model to quantify the quenched mass portion of SFGs ( f Q ) at fixed stellar mass ( M * ) and to reconcile the MS slopes in both the low- and the high-mass regimes. In this model, each SFG is composed of a star-forming plus a quenched component. The mass of the star-forming component ( M SF ) correlates with the star formation rate (SFR) following a relation SFR ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/834/1/39/apjaa4e3cieqn1.gif] {$\propto \,{M}_{\mathrm{SF}}^{{\alpha }_{\mathrm{SF}}}$} , where α SF ∼ 1.0. The quenched component contributes to the stellar mass but not to the SFR. It is thus possible to quantify f Q based on the departure of the observed MS slope α from α SF . Adopting the redshift-dependent MS slope reported by Whitaker et al., we explore the evolution of the ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/834/1/39/apjaa4e3cieqn2.gif] {${f}_{{\rm{Q}}}\mbox{--}{M}_{* }$} relations over z = [0.5, 2.5]. We find that Milky Way-like SFGs (with ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/834/1/39/apjaa4e3cieqn3.gif] {${M}_{* }\approx {10}^{10.7}\,{M}_{\odot }$} ) typically have an f Q = 30%–40% at z ∼ 2.25, whereas this value rapidly rises up to 70%–80% at z ∼ 0.75. The origin of an α ∼ 1.0 MS slope seen in the low-mass regime is also discussed. We argue for a scenario in which the majority of low-mass SFGs stay in a “steady-stage” star formation phase. In this phase, the SFR is mainly regulated by stellar feedback and not significantly influenced by the quenching mechanisms, thus remaining roughly constant over cosmic time. This scenario successfully produces an α ∼ 1.0 MS slope, as well as the observed MS evolution from z = 2.5 to z = 0 at low masses.},

We demonstrate that the correlation between the stellar mass surface density ($\Sigma\_*$) and star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma\_{\mathrm{SFR}}$) holds down to sub-galactic scale, leading to the Sub-Galactic Main Sequence (SGMS). By dividing galaxies into two populations based on their recent mass assembly modes, we find the resolved main sequence in galaxies with 'outside-in' mode is steeper than that in galaxies with 'inside-out' mode. This is also confirmed on a galaxy-by-galaxy level, where we find the distributions of SGMS slopes for individual galaxies are clearly separated for the two populations. When normalizing and stacking the SGMS of individual galaxies on one panel for the two populations, we find the inner regions of galaxies with 'inside-out' mode statistically exhibit a suppression in star formation, with a less significant trend in the outer regions of galaxies with 'outside-in' mode. In contrast, the inner regions of galaxies with 'outside-in' mode and the outer regions of galaxies with 'inside-out' mode follow a slightly sub-linear scaling relation with a slope $\sim$0.9, which is in good agreement with previous findings, suggesting that they are experiencing a universal regulation without influences of additional physical processes.},

  abstract      = {We explore observational and theoretical constraints on how galaxies might transition between the 'star-forming main sequence' (SFMS) and varying 'degrees of quiescence' out to z = 3. Our analysis is focused on galaxies with stellar mass M$_{*}$ $\gt$ 10$^{10}$ M$_{⊙}$, and is enabled by GAMA and CANDELS observations, a semi-analytic model (SAM) of galaxy formation, and a cosmological hydrodynamical 'zoom in' simulation with momentum-driven AGN feedback. In both the observations and the SAM, transition galaxies tend to have intermediate S{\'e}rsic indices, half-light radii, and surface stellar mass densities compared to star-forming and quiescent galaxies out to z = 3. We place an observational upper limit on the average population transition time-scale as a function of redshift, finding that the average high-redshift galaxy is on a 'fast track' for quenching whereas the average low-redshift galaxy is on a 'slow track' for quenching. We qualitatively identify four physical origin scenarios for transition galaxies in the SAM: oscillations on the SFMS, slow quenching, fast quenching, and rejuvenation. Quenching time-scales in both the SAM and the hydrodynamical simulation are not fast enough to reproduce the quiescent population that we observe at z {\sim} 3. In the SAM, we do not find a clear-cut morphological dependence of quenching time-scales, but we do predict that the mean stellar ages, cold gas fractions, SMBH (supermassive black hole) masses and halo masses of transition galaxies tend to be intermediate relative to those of star-forming and quiescent galaxies at z $\lt$ 3.},

We utilize a compilation of 40 observational studies from the literature and correct them for potential biases. Using our robust determinations of halo mass assembly and the SHMR, we infer star formation histories, merger rates and structural properties for average galaxies, combining star-forming and quenched galaxies. Our main findings are as follows: (1) The halo mass M$_{50}$ above which 50 per cent of galaxies are quenched coincides with sSFR/sMAR {\tilde} 1, where sSFR is the specific SFR and sMAR is the specific halo mass accretion rate. (2) M$_{50}$ increases with redshift, presumably due to cold streams being more efficient at high redshifts, while virial shocks and active galactic nucleus feedback become more relevant at lower redshifts. (3) The ratio sSFR/sMAR has a peak value, which occurs around $\{$M\_vir$\}${\tilde} 2{\times} 10\^{}$\{$11$\}$ M\_$\{${\sun}$\}$. (4) The stellar mass density within 1 kpc, {$\Sigma$}$_{1}$, is a good indicator of the galactic global sSFR. (5) Galaxies are statistically quenched after they reach a maximum in {$\Sigma$}$_{1}$, consistent with theoretical expectations of the gas compaction model; this maximum depends on redshift. (6) In-situ star formation is responsible for most galactic stellar mass growth, especially for lower mass galaxies. (7) Galaxies grow inside-out. The marked change in the slope of the size-mass relation when galaxies became quenched, from d log $\{$R\_eff$\}$/d log $\{$M\_*$\}${\tilde} 0.35 to {\tilde}2.5, could be the result of dry minor mergers.},

Once completed, we expect to have detailed morphological classifications for over 50,000 galaxies spanning 0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 4 over all the fields, with classifications from 3 to 5 independent classifiers for each galaxy. Here, we present our detailed visual classification scheme, which was designed to cover a wide range of CANDELS science goals. This scheme includes the basic Hubble sequence types, but also includes a detailed look at mergers and interactions, the clumpiness of galaxies, k-corrections, and a variety of other structural properties. In this paper, we focus on the first field to be completed{\mdash}GOODS-S, which has been classified at various depths. The wide area coverage spanning the full field (wide+deep+ERS) includes 7634 galaxies that have been classified by at least three different people. In the deep area of the field, 2534 galaxies have been classified by at least five different people at three different depths. With this paper, we release to the public all of the visual classifications in GOODS-S along with the Perl/Tk GUI that we developed to classify galaxies. We present our initial results here, including an analysis of our internal consistency and comparisons among multiple classifiers as well as a comparison to the S{\'e}rsic index. We find that the level of agreement among classifiers is quite good ($\gt$70\% across the full magnitude range) and depends on both the galaxy magnitude and the galaxy type, with disks showing the highest level of agreement ($\gt$50\%) and irregulars the lowest ($\lt$10\%). A comparison of our classifications with the S{\'e}rsic index and rest-frame colors shows a clear separation between disk and spheroid populations. Finally, we explore morphological k-corrections between the V-band and H-band observations and find that a small fraction (84 galaxies in total) are classified as being very different between these two bands. These galaxies typically have very clumpy and extended morphology or are very faint in the V-band.},

  abstract      = {We use cosmological simulations to study a characteristic evolution pattern of high-redshift galaxies. Early, stream-fed, highly perturbed, gas-rich discs undergo phases of dissipative contraction into compact, star-forming systems (`blue' nuggets) at z {\tilde} 4-2. The peak of gas compaction marks the onset of central gas depletion and inside-out quenching into compact ellipticals (red nuggets) by z {\tilde} 2. These are sometimes surrounded by gas rings or grow extended dry stellar envelopes. The compaction occurs at a roughly constant specific star formation rate (SFR), and the quenching occurs at a constant stellar surface density within the inner kpc ({$\Sigma$}$_{1}$). Massive galaxies quench earlier, faster, and at a higher {$\Sigma$}$_{1}$ than lower mass galaxies, which compactify and attempt to quench more than once. This evolution pattern is consistent with the way galaxies populate the SFR-size-mass space, and with gradients and scatter across the main sequence. The compaction is triggered by an intense inflow episode, involving (mostly minor) mergers, counter-rotating streams or recycled gas, and is commonly associated with violent disc instability. The contraction is dissipative, with the inflow rate $\gt$SFR, and the maximum {$\Sigma$}$_{1}$ anticorrelated with the initial spin parameter. The central quenching is triggered by the high SFR and stellar/supernova feedback (maybe also active galactic nucleus feedback) due to the high central gas density, while the central inflow weakens as the disc vanishes. Suppression of fresh gas supply by a hot halo allows the long-term maintenance of quenching once above a threshold halo mass, inducing the quenching downsizing.},

  abstract      = {We investigate the roles of two classes of quenching mechanisms for central and satellite galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (z $\lt$ 0.075): those involving the halo and those involving the formation of a compact centre. For central galaxies with inner compactness {$\Sigma$}$_{1 kpc}$ {\tilde} 10$^{9-9.4}$ M$_{⊙}$ kpc$^{-2}$, the quenched fraction f$_{q}$ is strongly correlated with {$\Sigma$}$_{1 kpc}$ with only weak halo mass M$_{h}$ dependence. However, at higher and lower {$\Sigma$}$_{1 kpc}$, specific star formation rate (sSFR) is a strong function of M$_{h}$ and mostly independent of {$\Sigma$}$_{1 kpc}$. In other words, {$\Sigma$}$_{1 kpc}$ {\tilde} 10$^{9-9.4}$ M$_{⊙}$ kpc$^{-2}$ divides galaxies into those with high sSFR below and low sSFR above this range. In both the upper and lower regimes, increasing M$_{h}$ shifts the entire sSFR distribution to lower sSFR without a qualitative change in shape. This is true even at fixed M$_{*}$, but varying M$_{*}$ at fixed M$_{h}$ adds no quenching information. Most of the quenched centrals with M$_{h}$ $\gt$ 10$^{11.8}$ M$_{⊙}$ are dense ({$\Sigma$}$_{1 kpc}$ $\gt$ 10$^{9}$ M$_{⊙}$ kpc$^{-2}$), suggesting compaction-related quenching maintained by halo-related quenching. However, 21 per cent are diffuse, indicating only halo quenching. For satellite galaxies in the outskirts of haloes, quenching is a strong function of compactness and a weak function of host M$_{h}$. In the inner halo, M$_{h}$ dominates quenching, with {\tilde}90 per cent of the satellites being quenched once M$_{h}$ $\gt$ 10$^{13}$ M$_{⊙}$. This regional effect is greatest for the least massive satellites. As demonstrated via semi-analytic modelling with simple prescriptions for quenching, the observed correlations can be explained if quenching due to central compactness is rapid while quenching due to halo mass is slow.},

  abstract      = {We present an analysis of the deepest Herschel images in four major extragalactic fields GOODS-North, GOODS-South, UDS, and COSMOS obtained within the GOODS-Herschel and CANDELS-Herschel key programs. The star formation picture provided by a total of 10 497 individual far-infrared detections is supplemented by the stacking analysis of a mass complete sample of 62 361 star-forming galaxies from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) H band-selected catalogs of the CANDELS survey and from two deep ground-based K$_{s}$ band-selected catalogs in the GOODS-North and the COSMOS-wide field to obtain one of the most accurate and unbiased understanding to date of the stellar mass growth over the cosmic history. We show, for the first time, that stacking also provides a powerful tool to determine the dispersion of a physical correlation and describe our method called ``scatter stacking'', which may be easily generalized to other experiments. The combination of direct UV and far-infrared UV-reprocessed light provides a complete census on the star formation rates (SFRs), allowing us to demonstrate that galaxies at z = 4 to 0 of all stellar masses (M$_{∗}$) follow a universal scaling law, the so-called main sequence of star-forming galaxies. We find a universal close-to-linear slope of the log $_{10}$(SFR)-log $_{10}$(M$_{∗}$) relation, with evidence for a flattening of the main sequence at high masses (log $_{10}$(M$_{∗}$/M$_{⊙}$) $\gt$ 10.5) that becomesless prominent with increasing redshift and almost vanishes by z {\sime} 2. This flattening may be due to the parallel stellar growth of quiescent bulges in star-forming galaxies, which mostly happens over the same redshift range. Within the main sequence, we measure a nonvarying SFR dispersion of 0.3 dex: at a fixed redshift and stellar mass, about 68\% of star-forming galaxies form stars at a universal rate within a factor 2. The specific SFR (sSFR = SFR/M$_{∗}$) of star-forming galaxies is found to continuously increase from z = 0 to 4. Finally we discuss the implications of our findings on the cosmic SFR history and on the origin of present-day stars: more than two-thirds of present-day stars must have formed in a regime dominated by the ``main sequence'' mode. As a consequence we conclude that, although omnipresent in the distant Universe, galaxy mergers had little impact in shaping the global star formation history over the last 12.5 billion years.

  abstract      = {We measure new estimates for the galaxy stellar mass function and star formation rates for samples of galaxies at z {\tilde} 4, 5, 6 and 7 using data in the CANDELS GOODS South field. The deep near-infrared observations allow us to construct the stellar mass function at z {\ge} 6 directly for the first time. We estimate stellar masses for our sample by fitting the observed spectral energy distributions with synthetic stellar populations, including nebular line and continuum emission. The observed UV luminosity functions for the samples are consistent with previous observations; however, we find that the observed M$_{UV}$-M$_{*}$ relation has a shallow slope more consistent with a constant mass-to-light ratio and a normalization which evolves with redshift. Our stellar mass functions have steep low-mass slopes ({$\alpha$} {\ap} -1.9), steeper than previously observed at these redshifts and closer to that of the UV luminosity function. Integrating our new mass functions, we find the observed stellar mass density evolves from log \_$\{$10$\}$ {$\rho$} \_$\{$*$\}$ = 6.64\^{}$\{$+0.58$\}$\_$\{$-0.89$\}$ at z {\tilde} 7 to 7.36 {\plusmn} 0.06 M$_{⊙}$ Mpc$^{- 3}$ at z {\tilde} 4. Finally, combining the measured UV continuum slopes ({$\beta$}) with their rest-frame UV luminosities, we calculate dust-corrected star formation rates (SFR) for our sample. We find the specific SFR for a fixed stellar mass increases with redshift whilst the global SFR density falls rapidly over this period. Our new SFR density estimates are higher than previously observed at this redshift.},

  abstract = {This is the second paper in a series aimed at investigating the main sources of uncertainty in measuring the observable parameters in galaxies from their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). In the first paper we presented a detailed account of the photometric redshift measurements and an error analysis of this process. In this paper we perform a comprehensive study of the main sources of random and systematic error in stellar mass estimates for galaxies, and their relative contributions to the associated error budget. Since there is no prior knowledge of the stellar mass of galaxies (unlike their photometric redshifts), we use mock galaxy catalogs with simulated multi-waveband photometry and known redshift, stellar mass, age and extinction for individual galaxies. The multi-waveband photometry for the simulated galaxies were generated in 13 filters spanning from U -band to mid-infrared wavelengths. Given different parameters affecting stellar mass measurement (photometric signal-to-noise ratios (S/N), SED fitting errors and systematic effects), the inherent degeneracies and correlated errors, we formulated different simulated galaxy catalogs to quantify these effects individually. For comparison, we also generated catalogs based on observed photometric data of real galaxies in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-South field, spanning the same passbands. The simulated and observed catalogs were provided to a number of teams within the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey collaboration to estimate the stellar masses for individual galaxies. A total of 11 teams participated, with different combinations of stellar mass measurement codes/methods, population synthesis models, star formation histories, extinction and age. For each simulated galaxy, the differences between the input stellar masses, M input , and those estimated by each team, M est , is defined as ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/808/1/101/apj515559ieqn1.gif] {${\rm{\Delta }}\mathrm{log}(M)\equiv \mathrm{log}({M}_{\mathrm{estimated}})-\mathrm{log}({M}_{\mathrm{input}})$} , and used to identify the most fundamental parameters affecting stellar mass estimate in galaxies, with the following results. (1) No significant bias in Δ log( M ) was found among different codes, with all having comparable scatter ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/808/1/101/apj515559ieqn2.gif] {$\sigma ({\rm{\Delta }}\mathrm{log}(M))=0.136$} dex). The estimated stellar mass values are seriously affected by low photometric S/N, with the rms scatter increasing for galaxies with ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/808/1/101/apj515559ieqn3.gif] {${H}_{\mathrm{AB}}\gt 26$} mag; (2) A source of error contributing to the scatter in Δ log( M ) is found to be due to photometric uncertainties (0.136 dex) and low resolution in age and extinction grids when generating the SED templates; (3) The median of stellar masses among different methods provides a stable measure of the mass associated with any given galaxy ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/808/1/101/apj515559ieqn4.gif] {$\sigma ({\rm{\Delta }}\mathrm{log}(M))=0.142$} dex); (4) The Δ log( M ) values are strongly correlated with deviations in age (defined as the difference between the estimated and expected values), with a weaker correlation with extinction; (5) The rms scatter in the estimated stellar masses due to free parameters (after fixing redshifts and initial mass function) are quantified and found to be ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/808/1/101/apj515559ieqn5.gif] {$\sigma ({\rm{\Delta }}\mathrm{log}(M))=0.110$} dex; (6) Using the observed data, we studied the sensitivity of stellar masses to both the population synthesis codes and inclusion of nebular emission lines and found them to affect the stellar mass by 0.2 and 0.3 dex respectively.},

Data used for photometric redshifts include intermediate-band photometry deblended using the TFIT method, which is used for the first time in this work. Photometric redshifts for X-ray source counterparts are based on a new library of active galactic nuclei/galaxy hybrid templates appropriate for the faint X-ray population in the CDFS. Photometric redshift accuracy for normal galaxies is 0.010 and for X-ray sources is 0.014 and outlier fractions are 4\% and 5.2\%, respectively. The results within the CANDELS coverage area are even better, as demonstrated both by spectroscopic comparison and by galaxy-pair statistics. Intermediate-band photometry, even if shallow, is valuable when combined with deep broadband photometry. For best accuracy, templates must include emission lines.},

  abstract      = {We determine the intrinsic, three-dimensional shape distribution of star-forming galaxies at 0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2.5, as inferred from their observed projected axis ratios. In the present-day universe, star-forming galaxies of all masses 10$^{9}$-10$^{11}$ M $_{⊙}$ are predominantly thin, nearly oblate disks, in line with previous studies. We now extend this to higher redshifts, and find that among massive galaxies (M $_{*}$ $\gt$ 10$^{10}$ M $_{⊙}$) disks are the most common geometric shape at all z $\lt$\~{} 2. Lower-mass galaxies at z $\gt$ 1 possess a broad range of geometric shapes: the fraction of elongated (prolate) galaxies increases toward higher redshifts and lower masses. Galaxies with stellar mass 10$^{9}$ M $_{⊙}$ (10$^{10}$ M $_{⊙}$) are a mix of roughly equal numbers of elongated and disk galaxies at z \~{} 1 (z \~{} 2). This suggests that galaxies in this mass range do not yet have disks that are sustained over many orbital periods, implying that galaxies with present-day stellar mass comparable to that of the Milky Way typically first formed such sustained stellar disks at redshift z \~{} 1.5-2. Combined with constraints on the evolution of the star formation rate density and the distribution of star formation over galaxies with different masses, our findings imply that, averaged over cosmic time, the majority of stars formed in disks.

  abstract      = {We present a study of the HI gas content of a large K-band selected sample of 88 close major-merger pairs of galaxies (H-KPAIR) which were observed by $\it Herschel$. We obtained the 21 cm HI fine-structure emission line data for a total of 70 pairs from this sample, by observing 58 pairs using the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) and retrieving the HI data for an addition 12 pairs from the literature. In this HI sample, 34 pairs are spiral-spiral (S+S) pairs, and 36 are spiral-elliptical (S+E). Based on these data, we studied the HI-to-stellar mass ratio, the HI gas fraction and the HI star formation efficiency (SFE$\_{\mathrm{HI}}$ = star formation rate/$M\_{\mathrm{HI}}$) and searched for differences between S+S and S+E pairs, as well as between pairs with and without signs for merger/interaction. Our results showed that the mean HI-to-stellar mass ratio of spirals in these pairs is $=7.6\pm1.0 \\%$, consistent with the average HI gas fraction of spiral galaxies in general. The differences in the HI gas fraction between spirals in S+S and in S+E pairs, and between spirals in pairs with and without signs of merger/interaction are insignificant ($\lt 1 \sigma$). On the other hand, the mean SFE$\_{\mathrm{HI}}$ of S+S pairs is $\sim4.6\times$ higher than that of S+E pairs. This difference is very significant ($\sim 4\sigma$) and is the main result of our study. There is no significant difference in the mean SFE$\_{\mathrm{HI}}$ between galaxies with and without signs of merger/interaction. The mean SFE$\_{\mathrm{HI}}$ of the whole pair sample is $10^{-9.55\pm 0.09}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, corresponding to a HI consumption time of $3.5\pm0.7$\~{}Gyrs.},

  abstract      = {Deep far-infrared (FIR) cosmological surveys are known to be affected by source confusion, causing issues when examining the main sequence (MS) of star forming galaxies. This has typically been partially tackled by the use of stacking. However, stacking only provides the average properties of the objects in the stack. This work aims to trace the MS over $0.2\leq z\lt6.0$ using the latest de-blended Herschel photometry, which reaches $\approx10$ times deeper than the 5$\sigma$ confusion limit in SPIRE. This provides more reliable star formation rates (SFRs), especially for the fainter galaxies, and hence a more reliable MS. We built a pipeline that uses the spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling and fitting tool CIGALE to generate flux density priors in the Herschel SPIRE bands. These priors were then fed into the de-blending tool XID+ to extract flux densities from the SPIRE maps. Multi-wavelength data were combined with the extracted SPIRE flux densities to constrain SEDs and provide stellar mass (M$\_{\star}$) and SFRs. These M$\_{\star}$ and SFRs were then used to populate the SFR-M$\_{\star}$ plane over $0.2\leq z\lt6.0$. No significant evidence of a high-mass turn-over was found; the best fit is thus a simple two-parameter power law of the form log(SFR)$=\alpha[$log(M$\_{\star})-10.5]+\beta$. The normalisation of the power law increases with redshift, rapidly at $z\lesssim1.8$, from $0.58\pm0.09$ at $z\approx0.37$ to $1.31\pm0.08$ at $z\approx1.8$. The slope is also found to increase with redshift, perhaps with an excess around $1.8\leq z\lt2.9$. The increasing slope indicates that galaxies become more self-similar as redshift increases, implying that the specific SFR of high-mass galaxies increases over $z=0.2$ to $z=6.0$, becoming closer to that of low-mass galaxies. The excess in the slope at $1.8\leq z\lt2.9$, if present, coincides with the peak of the cosmic star formation history.},

The optically faint RGs shows a flat slope in the i-band number counts down to 24 mag, implying either less-massive or distant radio-AGNs beyond 24 mag. The photometric redshift and the comparison of colors with the galaxy models show that most of the matched RGs are distributed at redshifts from 0 to 1.5. The optically faint sample includes the high radio-loudness sources that are not seen in the optically bright sample. Such sources are located at a redshift of larger than 1.

  abstract      = {In hierarchical models of galaxy formation, stellar tidal streams are expected around most, if not all, galaxies. Although these features may provide useful diagnostics of the $\Lambda$CDM model, their observational properties remain poorly constrained because they are challenging to detect and interpret and have been studied in detail for only a sparse sampling of galaxy population. More quantitative, systematic approaches are required. We advocate statistical analysis of the counts and properties of such features in archival wide-field imaging surveys for a direct comparison against results from numerical simulations. Thus, in this paper we aim to study systematically the frequency of occurrence and other observational properties of tidal features around nearby galaxies. The sample we construct will act as a foundational dataset for statistical comparison with cosmological models of galaxy formation. Our approach is based on a visual classification of diffuse features around a volume-limited sample of nearby galaxies, using a post-processing of Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging optimized for the detection of stellar structure with low surface brightness. At a limiting surface brightness of $28\ \mathrm{mag~arcsec^{-2}}$, 14\% of the galaxies in our sample exhibit evidence of diffuse features likely to have arisen from minor merging events. Our technique recovers all previously known streams in our sample and yields a number of new candidates. Consistent with previous studies, coherent arc-like features and shells are the most common type of tidal structures found in this study. We conclude that although some detections are ambiguous and could be corroborated or refuted with deeper imaging, our technique provides a reliable foundation for the statistical analysis of diffuse circumgalactic features in wide-area imaging surveys, and for the identification of targets for follow-up studies.},

Using ALMA and PdBI observations, we spatially resolve the CO(1-0) emission from the outflowing molecular gas in both and find maximum outflow velocities of $ v\_{\rm max} \sim 1600$ and $\sim 1700$ km/s for IRAS 20100-4156 and IRAS 03158+4227, respectively. We find total gas mass outflow rates of $\dot M\_{\rm OF} \sim 670$ and $\sim 350$ Msun/yr, respectively, corresponding to molecular gas depletion timescales $\tau^{\rm dep}\_{\rm OF} \sim 11$ and $\sim 16$ Myr. This is nearly 3 times shorter than the depletion timescales implied by star formation, $\tau^{\rm dep}\_{\rm SFR} \sim 33$ and $\sim 46$ Myr, respectively. To determine the outflow driving mechanism, we compare the starburst ($L\_{*}$) and AGN ($L\_{\rm AGN}$) luminosities to the outflowing energy and momentum fluxes, using mid-infrared spectral decomposition to discern $L\_{\rm AGN}$. Comparison to other molecular outflows in ULIRGs reveals that outflow properties correlate similarly with $L\_{*}$ and $L\_{\rm IR}$ as with $L\_{\rm AGN}$, indicating that AGN luminosity alone may not be a good tracer of feedback strength and that a combination of AGN and starburst activity may be driving the most powerful molecular outflows. We also detect the OH 1.667 GHz maser line from both sources and demonstrate its utility in detecting molecular outflows.},

  abstract      = {We propose the formation of massive pristine dark-matter (DM) halos with masses of $\sim 10^8~M\_\odot$, due to the dynamical effects of frequent mergers in rare regions of the Universe with high baryonic streaming velocity relative to DM. Since the streaming motion prevents gas collapse into DM halos and delays prior star formation episodes, the gas remains metal-free until the halo virial temperatures $\gtrsim 2\times 10^4~{\rm K}$. The minimum cooling mass of DM halos is boosted by a factor of $\sim 10-30$ because frequent major mergers of halos further inhibit gas collapse. We use Monte Carlo merger trees to simulate the DM assembly history under a streaming velocity of twice the root-mean-square value, and estimate the number density of massive DM halos containing pristine gas as $\simeq 10^{-4}~{\rm cMpc}^{-3}$. When the gas infall begins, efficient Ly$\alpha$ cooling drives cold streams penetrating inside the halo and feeding a central galactic disk. When one stream collides with the disk, strong shock forms a dense and hot gas cloud, where the gas never forms H$\_2$ molecules due to effective collisional dissociation. As a result, a massive gas cloud forms by gravitational instability and collapses directly into a massive black hole (BH) with $M\_\bullet \sim 10^5~M\_\odot$. Almost simultaneously, a galaxy with $M\_{\star, \rm tot}\sim 10^6~M\_\odot$ composed of Population III stars forms in the nuclear region. If the typical stellar mass is as high as $\sim 100~M\_\odot$, the galaxy could be detected with the James Webb Space Telescope even at $z\gtrsim 15$. These massive seed BHs would be fed by continuous gas accretion from the host galaxy, and grow to be bright quasars observed at $z\gtrsim 6$.},

  abstract      = {Cosmic acceleration is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many decades. Testing and distinguishing among possible explanations requires cosmological measurements of extremely high precision probing the full history of cosmic expansion and structure growth and, ideally, compare and contrast matter and relativistic tracers of the gravity potential. This program is one of the defining objectives of the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), as set forth in the New Worlds, New Horizons report (NWNH) in 2010. The WFIRST mission has the ability to improve these measurements by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to the current state of the art, while simultaneously extending their redshift grasp, greatly improving control of systematic effects, and taking a unified approach to multiple probes that provide complementary physical information and cross-checks of cosmological results. We describe in this annual report the activities of the Science Investigation Team (SIT) ``Cosmology with the High Latitude Survey (HLS)'' during the year 2017. This team was selected by NASA in December 2015 in order to address the stringent challenges of the WFIRST dark energy (DE) program through the Project's formulation phase. This SIT has elected to jointly address Galaxy Redshift Survey, Weak Lensing and Cluster Growth and thus fully embrace the fact that the imaging and spectroscopic elements of the HLS will be realized as an integrated observing program, and they jointly impose requirements on performance and operations. WFIRST is designed to be able to deliver a definitive result on the origin of cosmic acceleration. It is not optimized for Figure of Merit sensitivity but for control of systematic uncertainties and for having multiple techniques each with multiple cross-checks. Our SIT work focuses on understanding the potential systematics in the WFIRST DE measurements.},

We propose a direct method to probe the presence of dark matter subhalos in galaxy clusters by measuring the astrometric perturbation they induce on the image positions of magnified stars or bright clumps: lensing by subhalos breaks the symmetry of a smooth critical curve, traced by the midpoints of close image pairs. For the giant arc at $z = 0.725$ behind the lensing cluster Abell 370 at $z = 0.375$, a promising target for detecting image pairs of stars, we find that subhalos of masses in the range $10^6$--$10^8\,M\_\odot$ with the abundance predicted in the cold dark matter theory should typically imprint astrometric distortions at the level of $30$--$100\,{\rm mas}$. We estimate that $\sim 10\,$hr integrations with $\mathit{JWST}$ at $\sim 1$--$3\,\mu{\rm m}$ may uncover several magnified stars whose image doublets will reveal the subhalo-induced structures of the critical curve. This method can probe a dynamic range in the subhalo to cluster halo mass ratio $m/M \sim 10^{-7}$--$10^{-9}$, thereby placing new constraints on the nature of dark matter.},

  abstract      = {In our modern understanding of galaxy formation, every galaxy forms within a dark matter halo. The formation and growth of galaxies over time is connected to the growth of the halos in which they form. The advent of large galaxy surveys as well as high-resolution cosmological simulations has provided a new window into the statistical relationship between galaxies and halos and its evolution. Here we define this galaxy-halo connection as the multi-variate distribution of galaxy and halo properties that can be derived from observations and simulations. This connection provides a key test of physical galaxy formation models; it also plays an essential role in constraints of cosmological models using galaxy surveys and in elucidating the properties of dark matter using galaxies. We review techniques for inferring the galaxy-halo connection and the insights that have arisen from these approaches. Some things we have learned are that galaxy formation efficiency is a strong function of halo mass; at its peak in halos around a pivot halo mass of 10\^{}12 Msun, less than 20\% of the available baryons have turned into stars by the present day; the intrinsic scatter in galaxy stellar mass is small, less than 0.2 dex at a given halo mass above this pivot mass; below this pivot mass galaxy stellar mass is a strong function of halo mass; the majority of stars over cosmic time were formed in a narrow region around this pivot mass. We also highlight key open questions about how galaxies and halos are connected, including understanding the correlations with secondary properties and the connection of these properties to galaxy clustering.},

  abstract      = {The origin of ultracompact dwarfs (UCDs), a class of compact stellar systems discovered two decades ago, still remains a matter of debate. Recent discoveries of central supermassive black holes in UCDs likely inherited from their massive progenitor galaxies provide support for the tidal stripping hypothesis. At the same time, on statistical grounds, some massive UCDs might be representatives of the high luminosity tail of the globular cluster luminosity function. Here we present a detection of a $3.3^{+1.4}\_{-1.2}\times10^6\,M\_{\odot}$ black hole ($1\sigma$ uncertainty) in the centre of the UCD3 galaxy in the Fornax cluster, that corresponds to 4 per cent of its stellar mass. We performed isotropic Jeans dynamical modelling of UCD3 using internal kinematics derived from adaptive optics assisted observations with the SINFONI spectrograph and seeing limited data collected with the FLAMES spectrograph at the ESO VLT. We rule out the zero black hole mass at the $3\sigma$ confidence level when adopting a mass-to-light ratio inferred from stellar populations. This is the fourth supermassive black hole found in a UCD and the first one in the Fornax cluster. Similarly to other known UCDs that harbour black holes, UCD3 hosts metal rich stars enhanced in $\alpha$-elements that supports the tidal stripping of a massive progenitor as its likely formation scenario. We estimate that up to 80 per cent of luminous UCDs in galaxy clusters host central black holes. This fraction should be lower for UCDs in groups, because their progenitors are more likely to be dwarf galaxies, which do not tend to host central black holes.},

We define our BCGs by simultaneous consideration of legacy X-ray data from ROSAT, maximum likelihood outputs from an optical cluster-finder algorithm and visual inspection. Using SDSS imaging data, we fit S$\backslash$'ersic profiles to our BCGs in three bands ($\backslash$textit$\{$g$\}$, $\backslash$textit$\{$r$\}$, $\backslash$textit$\{$i$\}$) with $\backslash$textsc$\{$SIGMA$\}$, a $\backslash$textsc$\{$GALFIT$\}$-based software wrapper. We examine the reliability of our fits by running our pipeline on ${\sim}10^{4}$ psf-convolved model profiles injected into 8 random cluster fields, we then use the results of this analysis to create a robust subsample of 198 BCGs. We outline three cluster properties of interest: overall cluster X-ray luminosity ($L\_{X}$), cluster richness as estimated by $\backslash$textsc$\{$redMaPPer$\}$ ($ \lambda $) and cluster halo mass ($M\_{200}$), which is estimated via velocity dispersion. In general, there are significant correlations with BCG stellar mass between all three environmental properties, but no significant trends arise with either S$\backslash$'ersic index or effective radius. There is no major environmental dependence on the strength of the relation between effective radius and BCG stellar mass. Stellar mass therefore arises as the most important factor governing BCG morphology. Our results indicate that our sample consists of a large number of relaxed, mature clusters containing broadly homogeneous BCGs up to $z \sim 0.3$, suggesting that there is little evidence for much ongoing structural evolution for BCGs in these systems.},

The NGC 1978 spectra are used to examine stochastic effects on the integrated red light from an intermediate age cluster. The removal of either the brightest M giant or the brightest C star from the co-added NGC 1978 spectrum has minor effects on the equivalent withs of the Ca triplet. The most robust signature of C stars in the integrated cluster spectrum at these wavelengths is the CN band head near 0.79um. The equivalent widths of Ca triplet lines in the NGC 1978 spectrum and in the spectra of individual cluster stars are larger than expected for a scaled-solar abundance system, and it is suggested that these stars have been subject to extra mixing processes. Ca lines weaken with increasing distance from the disk plane in the NGC 55 spectra. Comparisons with models suggest that the red light from NGC 55 is dominated by stars with ages 1 - 2 Gyr, in agreement with star-forming histories (SFHs) obtained from the analysis of CMDs. The NGC 3109 observations sample three different parts of that galaxy but have a low signal-to-noise ratio. Comparisons with models suggest that the light from the NGC 3109 disk at red wavelengths is dominated by RSGs with ages of at most a few tens of Myr, in qualitative agreement with SFHs that are based on photometric measurements.},

  abstract      = {Our goal is to morphologically classify the sources identified in the images of the J-PLUS early data release (EDR) into compact (stars) or extended (galaxies) using a suited Bayesian classifier. J-PLUS sources exhibit two distinct populations in the r-band magnitude vs. concentration plane, corresponding to compact and extended sources. We modelled the two-population distribution with a skewed Gaussian for compact objects and a log-normal function for the extended ones. The derived model and the number density prior based on J-PLUS EDR data were used to estimate the Bayesian probability of a source to be star or galaxy. This procedure was applied pointing-by-pointing to account for varying observing conditions and sky position. Finally, we combined the morphological information from g, r, and i broad bands in order to improve the classification of low signal-to-noise sources. The derived probabilities are used to compute the pointing-by-pointing number counts of stars and galaxies. The former increases as we approach to the Milky Way disk, and the latter are similar across the probed area. The comparison with SDSS in the common regions is satisfactory up to r \~{} 21, with consistent numbers of stars and galaxies, and consistent distributions in concentration and (g - i) colour spaces. We implement a morphological star/galaxy classifier based on PDF analysis, providing meaningful probabilities for J-PLUS sources to one magnitude deeper (r \~{} 21) than a classical boolean classification. These probabilities are suited for the statistical study of 150k stars and 101k galaxies with 15 $\lt$ r $\lt$ 21 present in the 31.7 deg2 of the J-PLUS EDR. In a future version of the classifier, we will include J-PLUS colour information from twelve photometric bands.},

This would make it the most metal-poor globular cluster known in the Milky Way. This result was verified with comparisons to three other metal-poor globular clusters that had been observed and analyzed in the same manner. We also present new photometry of the cluster from EFOSC2 and SkyMapper and confirm that the cluster is located $22.9\pm2.1$ kpc from the Sun and $15.2\pm2.1$ kpc from the Galactic centre, and has a radial velocity of $92.5\substack{+2.4 \\ -1.6}$ km s$^{-1}$. These new data finds the cluster to have a radius about half that previously estimated, and we find that the cluster has a dynamical mass of the cluster of $(12\pm2)\times10^3$ solar masses. Unfortunately, we lack reliable proper motions to fully characterize its orbit about the Galaxy. Intriguingly, the photometry suggests that the cluster lacks a well-populated horizontal branch, something that has not been observed in a cluster so ancient or metal-poor.},

  abstract      = {We propose a new model for the ignition of star formation in low-mass halos by a self-sustaining shock front in cosmic filaments at high redshifts. The gaseous fuel for star formation resides in low mass halos which can not cool on their own due to their primordial composition and low virial temperatures. We show that star formation can be triggered in these filaments by a passing shock wave. The shells swept-up by the shock cool and fragment into cold clumps that form massive stars via thermal instability on a timescale shorter than the front's dynamical timescale. The shock, in turn, is self-sustained by energy injection from supernova explosions. The star formation front is analogous to a detonation wave, which drives exothermic reactions powering the shock. We find that sustained star formation would typically propel the front to a speed of $\sim 300-700\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$ during the epoch of reionization. Future observations by the $\textit{James Webb Space Telescope}$ could reveal the illuminated regions of cosmic filaments, and constrain the initial mass function of stars in them.},

  abstract      = {Recent long wavelength observations on the thermal dust continuum suggest that the Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) tail can be used as a time-efficient quantitative probe of the dust and ISM mass in high-$z$ galaxies. We use high-resolution cosmological simulations from the Feedback in Realistic Environment (FIRE) project to analyze the dust emission of $M\_*\gt10^{10}\;M\_{\odot}$ galaxies at $z=2-4$. Our simulations (MassiveFIRE) explicitly include various forms of stellar feedback, and they produce the stellar masses and star formation rates of high-$z$ galaxies in agreement with observations. Using radiative transfer modelling, we show that sub-millimeter (sub-mm) luminosity and molecular ISM mass are tightly correlated and that the overall normalization is in quantitative agreement with observations. Notably, sub-mm luminosity traces molecular ISM mass even during starburst episodes as dust mass and mass-weighted temperature evolve only moderately between $z=4$ and $z=2$, including during starbursts. Our finding supports the empirical approach of using broadband sub-mm flux as a proxy for molecular gas content in high-$z$ galaxies. We thus expect single-band sub-mm observations with ALMA to dramatically increase the sample size of high-$z$ galaxies with reliable ISM masses in the near future.},

  abstract      = {We examine the internal properties of the most massive ultracompact dwarf galaxy (UCD), M59-UCD3, by combining adaptive optics assisted near-IR integral field spectroscopy from Gemini/NIFS, and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging. We use the multi-band HST imaging to create a mass model that suggests and accounts for the presence of multiple stellar populations and structural components. We combine these mass models with kinematics measurements from Gemini/NIFS to find a best-fit stellar mass-to-light ratio ($M/L$) and black hole (BH) mass using Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM), axisymmetric Schwarzschild models, and triaxial Schwarzschild models. The best fit parameters in the JAM and axisymmetric Schwarzschild models have black holes between 2.5 and 5.9 million solar masses. The triaxial Schwarzschild models point toward a similar BH mass, but show a minimum $\chi^2$ at a BH mass of $\sim 0$. Models with a BH in all three techniques provide better fits to the central $V\_{rms}$ profiles, and thus we estimate the BH mass to be $4.2^{+2.1}\_{-1.7} \times 10^{6}$ M$\_\odot$ (estimated 1$\sigma$ uncertainties). We also present deep radio imaging of M59-UCD3 and two other UCDs in Virgo with dynamical BH mass measurements, and compare these to X-ray measurements to check for consistency with the fundamental plane of BH accretion. We detect faint radio emission in M59cO, but find only upper limits for M60-UCD1 and M59-UCD3 despite X-ray detections in both these sources. The BH mass and nuclear light profile of M59-UCD3 suggests it is the tidally stripped remnant of a $\sim$10$^{9-10}$ M$\_\odot$ galaxy.},

For z\~{}2 galaxies with moderate luminosities (L$_{8μm}$$\lt$10$^{11}$ L$_{solar}$), we find that the SFR can be estimated consistently from the multiwavelength data based on local luminosity correlations. However, 20\%-30\% of massive galaxies, and nearly all those with L$_{8μm}$$\gt$10$^{11}$ L$_{solar}$, show a mid-IR excess that is likely due to the presence of obscured active nuclei, as shown in a companion paper. There is a tight and roughly linear correlation between stellar mass and SFR for 24 {$\mu$}m-detected galaxies. For a given mass, the SFR at z=2 was larger by a factor of \~{}4 and \~{}30 relative to that in star-forming galaxies at z=1 and 0, respectively. Typical ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z=2 are relatively ``transparent'' to ultraviolet light, and their activity is long lived ($\gt$\~{}400 Myr), unlike that in local ULIRGs and high-redshift submillimeter-selected galaxies. ULIRGs are the common mode of star formation in massive galaxies at z=2, and the high duty cycle suggests that major mergers are not the dominant trigger for this activity. Current galaxy formation models underpredict the normalization of the mass-SFR correlation by about a factor of 4 and the space density of ULIRGs by an order of magnitude but give better agreement for z$\gt$1.4 quiescent galaxies.},

We describe the observations, data reduction, and extraction of basic flux and kinematic properties. With typically 3-4 times higher resolution and 4-5 times longer integrations (up to 23hr) than the seeing-limited datasets of the same objects, the AO data reveal much more detail in morphology and kinematics. The now complete AO observations confirm the majority of kinematically-classified disks and the typically elevated disk velocity dispersions previously reported based on subsets of the data. We derive typically flat or slightly negative radial [NII]/Ha gradients, with no significant trend with global galaxy properties, kinematic nature, or the presence of an AGN. Azimuthal variations in [NII]/Ha are seen in several sources and are associated with ionized gas outflows, and possible more metal-poor star-forming clumps or small companions. [Abridged]},

This galaxy resembles the Hoag's galaxy, one of the most spectacular examples of ring galaxies, characterized by a completely detached ring of young stars surrounding a central old spheroid. At odds with the isolated Hoag's galaxy, JO171 is part of a dense environment, the cluster Abell 3667, which is causing gas stripping along tentacles. Moreover, its ring counter-rotates with respect to the central spheroid. The joint analysis of the stellar populations and the gas/stellar kinematics shows that the origin of the ring was not due to an internal mechanism, but was related to a gas accretion event that happened in the distant past, prior to accretion onto Abell 3667, most probably within a filament. More recently, since infall in the cluster, the gas in the ring has been stripped by ram- pressure, causing the quenching of star formation in the stripped half of the ring. This is the first observed case of ram pressure stripping in action in a ring galaxy, and MUSE observations are able to reveal both of the events (accretion and stripping) that caused dramatic transformations in this galaxy.},

  abstract      = {Dust-enshrouded, starbursting, submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) at $z \geq 3$ have been proposed as progenitors of $z \geq 2$ compact quiescent galaxies (cQGs). To test this connection, we present a detailed spatially resolved study of the stars, dust and stellar mass in a sample of six submillimeter-bright starburst galaxies at $z \sim 4.5$. The stellar UV emission probed by HST is extended, irregular and shows evidence of multiple components. Informed by HST, we deblend Spitzer/IRAC data at rest-frame optical finding that the systems are undergoing minor mergers, with a typical stellar mass ratio of 1:6.5. The FIR dust continuum emission traced by ALMA locates the bulk of star formation in extremely compact regions (median $r\_{\rm{e}} = 0.70 \pm 0.29$ kpc) and it is in all cases associated with the most massive component of the mergers (median $\log (M\_{*}/M\_{\odot}) = 10.49 \pm 0.32$). We compare spatially resolved UV slope ($\beta$) maps with the FIR dust continuum to study the infrared excess ($\rm{IRX} = L\_{\rm{IR}}/L\_{\rm{UV}}$)-$\beta$ relation. The SMGs display systematically higher $\rm{IRX}$ values than expected from the nominal trend, demonstrating that the FIR and UV emissions are spatially disconnected. Finally, we show that the SMGs fall on the mass-size plane at smaller stellar masses and sizes than cQGs at $z = 2$. Taking into account the expected evolution in stellar mass and size between $z = 4.5$ and $z = 2$ due to the ongoing starburst and mergers with minor companions, this is in agreement with a direct evolutionary connection between the two populations.},

  abstract      = {ABRIDGED- The UV-optical color magnitude diagram (CMD) of rich galaxy groups is characterised by a well developed Red Sequence (RS), a Blue Cloud (BC) and the so-called Green Valley (GV). Loose, less evolved groups of galaxies likely not virialized yet may lack a well defined RS. This is actually explained in the framework of galaxy evolution. We are focussing on understanding galaxy migration towards the RS, checking for signatures of such a transition in their photometric and morphological properties. We report on the UV properties of a sample of ETGs galaxies inhabiting the RS. The analysis of their structures, as derived by fitting a Sersic law to their UV luminosity profiles, suggests the presence of an underlying disk. This is the hallmark of dissipation processes that still must have a role in the evolution of this class of galaxies. SPH simulations with chemo-photometric implementations able to match the global properties of our targets are used to derive their evolutionary paths through UV-optical CDM, providing some fundamental information such as the crossing time through the GV, which depends on their luminosity. The transition from the BC to the RS takes several Gyrs, being about 3-5 Gyr for the the brightest galaxies and more long for fainter ones, if it occurs. The photometric study of nearby galaxy structures in UV is seriously hampered by either the limited FoV of the cameras (e.g in HST) or by the low spatial resolution of the images (e.g in the GALEX). Current missions equipped with telescopes and cameras sensitive to UV wavelengths, such as Swift-UVOT and Astrosat-UVIT, provide a relatively large FoV and better resolution than the GALEX. More powerful UV instruments (size, resolution and FoV) are obviously bound to yield fundamental advances in the accuracy and depth of the surface photometry and in the characterisation of the galaxy environment.},

Hot galaxies are found to divide into groups in k-space that closely parallel conventional morphological classifications, namely, luminous ellipticals, compacts, bulges, bright dwarfs, and dwarf spheroidals. A major sequence is defined by luminous ellipticals, bulges, and most compacts, which together constitute a smooth continuum in k-space. Several properties vary smoothly with mass along this continuum, including bulge-to-disk ratio, radio properties, rotation, degree of velocity anisotropy, and 'unrelaxed'. A second major sequence is comprised of dwarf ellipticals and dwarf spheroidals. It is suggested that mass loss is a major factor in hot dwarf galaxies, but the dwarf sequence cannot be simply a mass-loss sequence, as it has the wrong direction in k-space.},

After recalibrating star formation measures, we are able to reliably measure specific star formation rates well below that of the so-called {\ldquo}main sequence{\rdquo} of star formation versus mass. We find an unexpectedly large population of quiescent galaxies with star formation rates intermediate between the main sequence and passive populations and with disproportionately high star formation rates. We demonstrate that a tight main sequence is a natural outcome of most histories of star formation and has little astrophysical significance but that the quiescent population requires additional astrophysics to explain its properties. Using a simple model for disk evolution based on the observed dependence of star formation on gas content in local galaxies, and assuming simple histories of cold gas inflow, we show that the evolution of galaxies away from the main sequence can be attributed to the depletion of gas due to star formation after a cutoff of gas inflow. The quiescent population is composed of galaxies in which the density of disk gas has fallen below a threshold for star formation probably set by disk stability. The evolution of galaxies beyond the quiescent state to gas exhaustion and the end of star formation requires another process, probably wind-driven mass loss. The environmental dependence of the three galaxy populations is consistent with recent numerical modeling, which indicates that cold gas inflows into galaxies are truncated at earlier epochs in denser environments.},

Both the 12 and 22 {$\mu$}m monochromatic luminosities correlate well with the reference the SFR estimates, but tend to underestimate the SFRs of metal-poor galaxies (at lower than solar metallicity), consistent with previous studies. We mitigate this metallicity dependence by using a linear combination of observed H{$\alpha$} and WISE MIR luminosities for our SFR estimates. This combination provides SFR measurements as robust as those applied to Spitzer data by Kennicutt et al. However, we find that the coefficient a in L $_{Hα(obs)}$ + aL $_{MIR}$ increases with the SFR, and show that a nonlinear combination of observed H{$\alpha$} and MIR luminosities gives the best SFR estimates with small scatters and with little dependence on physical parameters. Such a combination of H{$\alpha$} and MIR luminosities for SFR estimates is first applied to the WISE data. Using WISE data, we provide several SFR recipes that are applicable to galaxies with 0.1 lsim SFR (M $_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$) lsim 100.},

The H{$\alpha$} images of barred spiral galaxies often show active star formation in spiral arms, but less so in bars. We quantify the difference by measuring star formation rate (SFR) and star formation efficiency (SFE) at a scale where local star formation is spatially resolved. Our CO map covers the central 2farcm3 region of the galaxy; the combination of NRO45 and CARMA provides a high fidelity image, enabling accurate measurements of molecular gas surface density. We find that SFR and SFE are twice as high in the spiral arms as in the bar. We discuss this difference in the context of the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) law, which indicates a constant SFR at a given gas surface density. The KS law breaks down at our native resolution (\~{}250 pc), and substantial smoothing (to 500 pc) is necessary to reproduce the KS law, although with greater scatter.},

  abstract    = {We present a new measurement of the systemic proper motion of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), based on an expanded set of 30 fields containing background quasars and spanning a $\sim$3 year baseline, using the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} Wide Field Camera 3 (\textit{HST} WFC3). Combining this data with our previous 5 \textit{HST} fields, and an additional 8 measurements from the \textit{Gaia}-Tycho Astrometric Solution Catalog, brings us to a total of 43 SMC fields. We measure a systemic motion of $\mu_{W}$ = $-0.82$ $\pm$ 0.02 (random) $\pm$ 0.10 (systematic) mas yr$^{-1}$ and $\mu_{N}$ = $-1.21$ $\pm$ 0.01 (random) $\pm$ 0.03 (systematic) mas yr$^{-1}$. After subtraction of the systemic motion, we find little evidence for rotation, but find an ordered mean motion radially away from the SMC in the outer regions of the galaxy, indicating that the SMC is in the process of tidal disruption. We model the past interactions of the Clouds with each other based on the measured present-day relative velocity between them of $103 \pm 26$ km s$^{-1}$. We find that in 97\% of our considered cases, the Clouds experienced a direct collision $147 \pm 33$ Myr ago, with a mean impact parameter of $7.5 \pm 2.5$ kpc.},

J-PLUS is a multi narrow-band filter survey carried out with the 2 deg2 field of view T80Cam camera, mounted on the JAST/T80 telescope in the OAJ, Teruel, Spain. The information of the twelve J-PLUS bands, including the J0660 narrow-band filter located at rest-frame Halpha, is used over 42 deg2 to extract de-reddened and [NII] decontaminated Halpha emission line fluxes of 46 star-forming regions with previous SDSS and/or CALIFA spectroscopic information. The agreement of the inferred J-PLUS photometric Halpha fluxes and those obtained with spectroscopic data is remarkable, with a median comparison ratio R = 1.05 +- 0.25. This demonstrates that it is possible to retrieve reliable Halpha emission line fluxes from J-PLUS photometric data. With an expected area of thousands of square degrees upon completion, the J-PLUS dataset will allow the study of several star formation science cases in the nearby universe, as the spatially resolved star formation rate of nearby galaxies at z < 0.015, and how it is influenced by the environment, morphology or nuclear activity. As an illustrative example, the close pair of interacting galaxies NGC3994 and NGC3995 is analyzed, finding an enhancement of the star formation rate not only in the center, but also in outer parts of the disk of NGC3994.},

  title       = {Chemical enrichment in isolated barred spiral galaxies},
  abstract    = {To investigate the role of bars in the chemical evolution of isolated disc galaxies, we performed a series of 39 gas dynamical simulations of isolated barred and unbarred galaxies with various masses, initial gas fractions, and AGN feedback models. The presence of a bar drives a substantial amount of gas toward the central region of the galaxy. In the most massive galaxies, this results in a violent starburst, followed by a drop in star formation resulting from gas exhaustion. The time delay between Type Ia and Type II supernovae explosions means that barred galaxies experience a rapid increase in [O/H] in the central region, and a much more gradual increase in [Fe/H]. In unbarred galaxies, star formation proceeds at a slow and steady rate, and oxygen and iron are produced at steady rates which are similar except for a time offset. Comparing the abundance ratios in barred and unbarred galaxies with the same central stellar mass $M_*$, we find in barred galaxies an enhancement of 0.07 dex in [O/H], 0.05 dex in [Fe/H], and 0.05 dex in [O/Fe]. The [O/H] enhancement is in excellent agreement with observations from the SDSS. The initial gas fraction has very little effect on the abundance ratios in barred and unbarred galaxies, unless the galaxies experience a starburst. We considered AGN-host galaxies located near the bottom of the AGN regime, $M_*>3\times10^{10}M_\odot$, where AGN feedback dominates over supernovae feedback. We found that the impact of AGN feedback on the central abundances is marginal.},

  title       = {Difference in dwarf galaxy surface brightness profiles as a function of environment},
  abstract    = {We investigate surface brightness profiles (SBPs) of dwarf galaxies in field, group, and cluster environments. With deep $BVI$ images from the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network Supernova Program, SBPs of 38 dwarfs in the NGC 2784 group are fitted by a single exponential or double exponential model. We find that 53% of the dwarfs are fitted with single exponential profiles ("Type I"), while 47% of the dwarfs show double exponential profiles. 37% of all dwarfs have smaller sizes of the outer part than inner part ("Type II"), while 10% have a larger sized outer than inner part ("Type III"). We compare these results with those in the field and in the Virgo cluster, where SBP types of 102 field dwarfs are compiled from a previous study and SBP types of 375 cluster dwarfs are measured using SDSS $r$-band images. As a result, the distributions of SBP types are different in three environments. Common SBP types of the field, the NGC 2784 group, and the Virgo cluster are Type II, Type I and II, and Type I and III profiles, respectively. After comparing sizes of dwarfs in different environments, we suggest that since sizes of some dwarfs are changed due to the environmental effects, SBP types are able to be transformed and the distributions of SBP types in three environments are different. We discuss possible environmental mechanisms on the transformation of SBP types.},

  title       = {The dust and [CII] morphologies of redshift ~4.5 sub-millimeter galaxies at ~200pc resolution: The absence of large clumps in the interstellar medium of high-redshift galaxies},
  abstract    = {We present deep high resolution (0.03", 200pc) ALMA Band 7 observations covering the dust continuum and [CII] $\lambda157.7\mu$m emission in four $z\sim4.4-4.8$ sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs) selected from the ALESS and AS2UDS surveys. The data show that the rest-frame 160$\mu$m (observed 345 GHz) dust emission is consistent with smooth morphologies on kpc scales for three of the sources. One source, UDS47.0, displays apparent substructure but this is also consistent with a smooth morphology, as indicated by simulations showing that smooth exponential disks can appear clumpy when observed at high angular resolution (0.03") and depth of these observations ($\sigma_{345\text{GHz}} \sim27-47\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$). The four SMGs are bright [CII] emitters, and we extract [CII] spectra from the high resolution data, and recover $\sim20-100$% of the [CII] flux and $\sim40-80$% of the dust continuum emission, compared to the previous lower resolution observations. When tapered to 0.2" resolution our maps recover $\sim80-100$% of the continuum emission, indicating that $\sim60$% of the emission is resolved out on $\sim200$pc scales. We find that the [CII] emission in high-redshift galaxies is more spatially extended than the rest-frame 160$\mu$m dust continuum by a factor of $1.6\pm0.4$. By considering the $L_{\text{[CII]}}$/$L_{\text{FIR}}$ ratio as a function of the star-formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\text{SFR}}$) we revisit the [CII] deficit, and suggest that the decline in the $L_{\text{[CII]}}$/$L_{\text{FIR}}$ ratio as a function of $\Sigma_{\text{SFR}}$ is consistent with local processes. We also explore the physical drivers that may be responsible for these trends and can give rise to the properties found in the densest regions of SMGs.},

  abstract    = {Recent discoveries of bimodal main sequences (MSs) associated with young clusters (with ages $\lesssim 1$ Gyr) in the Magellanic Clouds have drawn a lot of attention. One of the prevailing formation scenarios attributes these split MSs to a bimodal distribution in stellar rotation rates, with most stars belonging to a rapidly rotating population. In this scenario, only a small fraction of stars populating a secondary blue sequence are slowly or non-rotating stars. Here, we focus on the blue MS in the young cluster NGC 1850. We compare the cumulative number fraction of the observed blue-MS stars to that of the high-mass-ratio binary systems at different radii. The cumulative distributions of both populations exhibit a clear anti-correlation, characterized by a highly significant Pearson coefficient of $-0.97$. Our observations are consistent with the possibility that blue-MS stars are low-mass-ratio binaries, and therefore their dynamical disruption is still ongoing. High-mass-ratio binaries, on the other hand, are more centrally concentrated.},

We use the Gini coefficient and M$_{20}$ to identify major mergers and classify galaxy morphology for a volume-limited sample of 3009 galaxies brighter than 0.4L$^{*}$$_{B}$, assuming pure luminosity evolution. We find that the merger fraction remains roughly constant at 10\% +/- 2\% for 0.2 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1.2. The fraction of E/S0/Sa galaxies increases from 21\% +/- 3\% at z \~{} 1.1 to 44\% +/- 9\% at z \~{} 0.3, while the fraction of Sb-Ir galaxies decreases from 64\% +/- 6\% at z \~{} 1.1 to 47\% +/- 9\% at z \~{} 0.3. The majority of z $\lt$ 1.2 Spitzer MIPS 24 {$\mu$}m sources with L(IR) $\gt$ 10$^{11}$ L$_{⊙}$ are disk galaxies, and only \~{}15\% are classified as major merger candidates. Edge-on and dusty disk galaxies (Sb-Ir) are almost a third of the red sequence at z \~{} 1.1, while E/S0/Sa make up over 90\% of the red sequence at z \~{} 0.3. Approximately 2\% of our full sample are red mergers. We conclude (1) the merger rate does not evolve strongly between 0.2 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1.2; (2) the decrease in the volume-averaged star formation rate density since z \~{} 1 is a result of declining star formation in disk galaxies rather than a disappearing population of major mergers; (3) the build-up of the red sequence at z $\lt$ 1 can be explained by a doubling in the number of spheroidal galaxies since z \~{} 1.2.},

For each galaxy, we obtain two-dimensional maps and radial profiles for three spectroscopically measured parameters that are sensitive to the recent SFH: D$_{ n }$(4000) (the 4000 {\AA} break), EW(H{$\delta$} $_{ A }$), and EW(H{$\alpha$}) (the equivalent width of the H{$\delta$} absorption and the H{$\alpha$} emission line). The majority of the spaxels are consistent with models of a continuously declining star formation rate, indicating that starbursts occur rarely in local galaxies with regular morphologies. We classify the galaxies into three classes: fully star-forming (SF), partly quenched (PQ), and totally quenched (TQ). The galaxies that are less massive than 10$^{10}$ M $_{⊙}$ present at most weak radial gradients in the diagnostic parameters. In contrast, massive galaxies with a stellar mass above 10$^{10}$ M $_{⊙}$ present significant gradients in the three diagnostic parameters if they are classified as SF or PQ but show weak gradients in D$_{ n }$(4000) and EW(H{$\delta$} $_{ A }$) and no gradients in EW(H{$\alpha$}) if they are in the TQ class. This implies the existence of a critical stellar mass ({\sim}10$^{10}$ M $_{⊙}$) above which the star formation in a galaxy is shut down from the inside out. Galaxies tend to evolve synchronously from the inner to the outer regions before their mass reaches the critical value. We have further divided the sample at a fixed mass by both bulge-to-total luminosity ratio and morphological type, finding that our conclusions hold regardless of these factors; it appears that the presence of a central dense object is not a driving parameter but rather a by-product of the star formation cessation process.},

  abstract = {We present a full-sky 100 {$\mu$}m map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 {$\mu$}m data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 {$\mu$}m map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of H$_{2}$ in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds are deficient in dust emission, as expected.  To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 {$\mu$}m DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 {$\mu$}m flux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 {$\mu$}m map no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 +/- 13 nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ at 140 {$\mu$}m and of 17 +/- 4 nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ at 240 {$\mu$}m (95\% confidence). This integrated flux \~{}2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field.  The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of 100 {$\mu$}m emission. We find consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B-V versus Mg$_{2}$ index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.},

  abstract      = {We present a hydrodynamical model of M33 and its recent interaction with M31. This scenario was previously proposed in the literature in order to explain the distorted gaseous and stellar disks of M33, as well as the increased star formation rate in both objects around 2 Gyr ago. We used an orbit integration scheme to find which estimate of the transverse velocity of M31 more favors the interaction scenario and then tried to reproduce it in our simulations. M33 was modeled as a stellar and gaseous disk embedded in a live dark-matter halo, while M31 was approximated only with a live dark halo. In the simulations the two galaxies passed each other with a pericenter distance of 37 kpc. Tides excited a two-armed spiral structure in the M33 disk, which is found to be the predominant spiral signal in the observed galaxy and has been long known as a feature easily induced by tidal interactions. We found that the gaseous warp produced by the interaction did not resemble enough the observed one and we performed an additional simulation including the hot gas halo of M31 to show that this feature can be properly reproduced by tidal forces and ram pressure stripping acting simultaneously on the gaseous disk. In addition to the spiral arms, tidal forces produced the stellar stream similar to the observed one and triggered a star formation burst at similar radii as it is observed.},

  abstract      = {We analyze the Illustris-1 hydrodynamical cosmological simulation to explore the stellar velocity dispersion of quiescent galaxies as an observational probe of dark matter halo velocity dispersion and mass. Stellar velocity dispersion is proportional to dark matter halo velocity dispersion for both central and satellite galaxies. The dark matter halos of central galaxies are in virial equilibrium and thus the stellar velocity dispersion is also proportional to dark matter halo mass. This proportionality holds even when a line-of-sight aperture dispersion is calculated in analogy to observations. In contrast, at a given stellar velocity dispersion, the dark matter halo mass of satellite galaxies is smaller than virial equilibrium expectations. This deviation from virial equilibrium probably results from tidal stripping of the outer dark matter halo. Stellar velocity dispersion appears insensitive to tidal effects and thus reflects the correlation between stellar velocity dispersion and dark matter halo mass prior to infall. There is a tight relation ($\lt$0.2 dex scatter) between line-of-sight aperture stellar velocity dispersion and dark matter halo mass suggesting that the dark matter halo mass may be estimated from the measured stellar velocity dispersion for both central and satellite galaxies. We evaluate the impact of treating all objects as central galaxies if the relation we derive is applied to a statistical ensemble. A large fraction ($\gt$2/3) of massive quiescent galaxies are central galaxies and systematic uncertainty in the inferred dark matter halo mass is $\lt$0.1 dex thus simplifying application of the simulation results to currently available observations.},

It also summarizes properties such as the Tully-Fisher and Faber-Jackson relations. Below about g\_bar= 10E-10 m s\^{}(-2), the observed relation deviates from the 1:1 line, g\_obs being much larger than g\_bar. The acceleration relation is followed by late and early type galaxies, and also by the dwarf spheroidals where the deviations from the 1:1 line are the largest ones. These deviations are currently attributed to dark matter. We show that the scale invariant theory, with the assumption of the scale invariance of the empty space, correctly predicts the observed deviations in the acceleration relation. The large deviations (up to a factor 400) and the flattening of the acceleration relation observed for the dwarf spheroidal galaxies are also well described. The presence of dark matter is no longer necessary in the scale invariant context, which also accounts why dark matter usually appears to dominate in galactic regions with low baryonic gravities.},

Our sample of galaxies is sub-divided into red, green and blue colour groups and into elliptical and non-elliptical (disk-type) morphologies. Using KiDS and VIKING derived postage stamp images, a group of eight volunteers visually classified bars, rings, morphological lenses, tidal streams, shells and signs of merger activity for all systems. We find a significant surplus of rings ($2.3\sigma$) and lenses ($2.9\sigma$) in disk-type galaxies as they transition across the green valley. Combined, this implies a joint ring/lens green valley surplus significance of $3.3\sigma$ relative to equivalent disk-types within either the blue cloud or the red sequence. We recover a bar fraction of \~{}44\% which remains flat with colour, however, we find that the presence of a bar acts to modulate the incidence of rings and (to a lesser extent) lenses, with rings in barred disk-type galaxies more common by \~{}20-30 percentage points relative to their unbarred counterparts, regardless of colour. Additionally, green valley disk-type galaxies with a bar exhibit a significant $3.0\sigma$ surplus of lenses relative to their blue/red analogues. The existence of such structures rules out violent transformative events as the primary end-of-life evolutionary mechanism, with a more passive scenario the favoured candidate for the majority of galaxies rapidly transitioning across the green valley.},

Some studies conclude that UDGs reside in massive dark matter halos while others, controversially, argue for the existence of UDGs with no dark matter at all. Here we show that these results arise because the uncertainties of these mass estimates have been substantially underestimated. Indeed, applying the same procedure to the well-studied Fornax dwarf spheroidal would conclude that it has an ``overmassive'' dark halo or, alternatively, that it lacks dark matter. We corroborate our argument with self- consistent mocks of tracers in cosmological halos, showing that masses from samples with $5 \lt N \lt 10$ tracers (assuming no measurement errors) are uncertain by at least an order of magnitude. Finally, we estimate masses of UDGs with HST imaging in Coma and show that their recent mass measurements (with adequate uncertainties) are in agreement with that of other dwarfs, such as Fornax.. We also provide bias and scatter factors for a range of sample sizes and measurement errors, of wider applicability.},

  abstract      = {A maximum stellar surface density $\Sigma\_{max} \sim 3 \times 10^5\,{\rm M\_\odot\,pc^{-2}}$ is observed across all classes of dense stellar systems (e.g. star clusters, galactic nuclei, etc.), spanning $\sim 8$ orders of magnitude in mass. It has been proposed that this characteristic scale is set by some dynamical feedback mechanism preventing collapse beyond a certain surface density. However, simple analytic models and detailed simulations of star formation moderated by feedback from massive stars argue that feedback becomes $\{$$\backslash$it less$\}$ efficient at higher surface densities (with the star formation efficiency increasing as $\sim \Sigma/\Sigma\_{crit}$). We therefore propose an alternative model wherein stellar feedback becomes ineffective at moderating star formation above some $\Sigma\_{crit}$, so the supply of star-forming gas is rapidly converted to stars before the system can contract to higher surface density. We show that such a model -- with $\Sigma\_{crit}$ taken directly from the theory -- naturally predicts the observed $\Sigma\_{max}$. $\Sigma\_{max}\sim 100\Sigma\_{crit}$ because the gas consumption time is longer than the global freefall time even when feedback is ineffective. Moreover the predicted $\Sigma\_{max}$ is robust to spatial scale and metallicity, and is preserved even if multiple episodes of star formation/gas inflow occur. In this context, the observed $\Sigma\_{max}$ directly tells us where feedback fails.},

Here, we show that a robust statistical measure of the velocity dispersion of the tracer globular clusters implies a mundane velocity dispersion and a poorly constrained mass-to-light ratio. Models that include the possibility that some of the tracers are field contaminants do not yield a more constraining inference. We derive only a weak constraint on the mass-to-light ratio of the system within the half-light radius or within the radius of the furthest tracer (M/L\_V$\lt$8.1 at the 90-percent confidence level). Typical mass-to-light ratios measured for dwarf galaxies of the same stellar mass as NGC1052-DF2 are well within this limit. With this study, we emphasize the need to properly account for measurement uncertainties and to stay as close as possible to the data when determining dynamical masses from very small data sets of tracers.},

  abstract      = {We present observations of NGC 1068 covering the $19.7-53.0$ $\mu$m wavelength range using FORCAST and HAWC+ onboard SOFIA. Using these observations, high-angular resolution infrared (IR) and sub-mm observations, we find an observational turn-over of the torus emission in the $30-40$ $\mu$m wavelength range with a characteristic temperature of $70-100$ K. This component is clearly different from the diffuse extended emission in the narrow line and star formation regions at 10-100 $\mu$m within the central 700 pc. We compute $2.2-432$ $\mu$m 2D images using the best inferred $\backslash$textsc$\{$clumpy$\}$ torus model based on several nuclear spectral energy distribution (SED) coverages. We find that when $1-20$ $\mu$m SED is used, the inferred result gives a small torus size ($\lt4$ pc radius) and a steep radial dust distribution. The computed torus using the $1-432$ $\mu$m SED provides comparable torus sizes, $5.1^{+0.4}\_{-0.4}$ pc radius, and morphology to the recently resolved 432 $\mu$m ALMA observations. This result indicates that the $1-20$ $\mu$m wavelength range is not able to probe the full extent of the torus. The characterization of the turn-over emission of the torus using the $30-60$ $\mu$m wavelength range is sensitive to the detection of cold dust in the torus. The morphology of the dust emission in our 2D image at 432 $\mu$m is spatially coincident with the cloud distribution, while the morphology of the emission in the $1-20$ $\mu$m wavelength range shows an elongated morphology perpendicular to the cloud distribution. We find that our 2D $\backslash$textsc$\{$clumpy$\}$ torus image at 12 $\mu$m can produce comparable results to those observed using IR interferometry.},

The toy models provide useful approximations for the behaviour of the simulated galaxies. We find that (a) the inflow rate is proportional to mass and to (1 + z)$^{5/2}$, (b) the penetration to the inner halo is {\tilde}50 per cent at z=4-2, (c) the disc radius is {\tilde}5 per cent of the virial radius, (d) the galaxies reach a steady state with the SFR following the accretion rate into the galaxy, (e) there is an intense gas inflow through the disc, comparable to the SFR, following the predictions of VDI and (f) the galaxies approach a steady state with the bulge mass comparable to the disc mass, where the draining of gas by SFR, outflows and disc inflows is replenished by fresh accretion.

Although this is commonly attributed to violent mergers, the properties of many of these galaxies are incompatible with such events, showing gas-rich, clumpy, extended rotating disks not dominated by spheroids. Cosmological simulations and clustering theory are used to explore how these galaxies acquired their gas. Here we report that they are `stream-fed galaxies', formed from steady, narrow, cold gas streams that penetrate the shock-heated media of massive dark matter haloes. A comparison with the observed abundance of star-forming galaxies implies that most of the input gas must rapidly convert to stars. One-third of the stream mass is in gas clumps leading to mergers of mass ratio greater than 1:10, and the rest is in smoother flows. With a merger duty cycle of 0.1, three-quarters of the galaxies forming stars at a given rate are fed by smooth streams. The rarer, submillimetre galaxies that form stars even more intensely are largely merger-induced starbursts. Unlike destructive mergers, the streams are likely to keep the rotating disk configuration intact, although turbulent and broken into giant star-forming clumps that merge into a central spheroid. This stream-driven scenario for the formation of discs and spheroids is an alternative to the merger picture.},

We split our sample in satellite ($R\ltR\_{200}$), nearby ($1\ltR/R\_{200}\lt2.5$), and field ($R\gt2.5 R\_{\rm 200}$) galaxies. Simulated galaxies from all three groups are in excellent agreement with Local Group dwarf galaxies in terms of: stellar mass-velocity dispersion, stellar mass-metallicity relation, star formation histories, and stellar mass functions. Satellites and nearby galaxies show lower velocity dispersions and gas fractions compared to field galaxies. While field galaxies follow global abundance matching relations, satellites and nearby galaxies deviate from them, showing lower dark matter masses for given stellar mass. The reason for this deficit in dark matter mass is substantial mass loss experienced by satellites and $\sim80$$\backslash$\% of the nearby galaxies, while orbiting inside $R\_{200}$ at earlier times. However, both satellites and nearby objects fall back onto the relation for field galaxies if we use the maximum of their virial mass instead of the present-day value. This allows us to provide estimates for the peak masses of observed Local Group galaxies. Finally, using radial velocities, distances, and the velocity dispersion-stellar mass relation from our simulations, we derive a metric to distinguish between galaxies harassed by the central object and unaffected ones. Applying this metric to observed objects we find that even far away dwarf galaxies like Eri II ($D\approx$ 370 kpc) have a strong probability ($\approx 83$$\backslash$\%) of having been affected by the Milky Way in the past. This naturally explains the lack of gas and recent star formation seen in Eri II.},

The shape of this law is crucial to test galaxy formation models, which are currently discrepant especially at the lowest masses, allowing to constrain fundamental parameters, e.g. the retained fraction of angular momentum. In this study, we accurately determine the empirical $j\_\ast-M\_\ast$ relation (Fall relation) for 92 nearby spiral galaxies (from S0 to Irr) selected from the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) sample in the unprecedented mass range $7 \lesssim \log M\_\ast/M\_\odot \lesssim 11.5$. We significantly improve all previous estimates of the Fall relation by determining $j\_\ast$ profiles homogeneously for all galaxies, using extended HI rotation curves, and selecting only galaxies for which a robust $j\_\ast$ could be measured (converged $j\_\ast(\ltR)$ radial profile). We find the relation to be well described by a single, unbroken power-law $j\_\ast\propto M\_\ast^\alpha$ over the entire mass range, with $\alpha=0.55\pm 0.02$ and orthogonal intrinsic scatter of $0.17\pm 0.01$ dex. We finally discuss some implications for galaxy formation models of this fundamental scaling law and, in particular, the fact that it excludes models in which discs of all masses retain the same fraction of the halo angular momentum.},

We use FIRE cosmological zoom-in simulations of three MW-mass disk galaxies to study the spatial distribution, chemistry, and kinematics of the oldest surviving stars ($z\_{\rm form} \gtrsim 5$) in MW-like galaxies. We predict the oldest stars to be less centrally concentrated at $z=0$ than stars formed at later times as a result of two processes. First, the majority of the oldest stars are not formed $\textit{in situ}$ but are accreted during hierarchical assembly. These $\textit{ex situ}$ stars are deposited on dispersion-supported, halo-like orbits but dominate over old stars formed $\textit{in situ}$ in the solar neighborhood, and in some simulations, even in the galactic center. Secondly, old stars formed $\textit{in situ}$ are driven outwards by bursty star formation and energetic feedback processes that create a time-varying gravitational potential at $z\gtrsim 2$, similar to the process that creates dark matter cores and expands stellar orbits in bursty dwarf galaxies. The total fraction of stars that are ancient is more than an order of magnitude higher for sight lines $\textit{away}$ from the bulge and inner halo than for inward-looking sight lines. Although the task of identifying specific stars as ancient remains challenging, we anticipate that million-star spectral surveys and photometric surveys targeting metal-poor stars already include hundreds of stars formed before $z=5$. We predict most of these targets to have higher metallicity ($-3 \lt \rm [Fe/H] \lt -2$) than the most extreme metal-poor stars.},

  title       = {GHASP: an H$α$ kinematical survey of spiral galaxies - XI. Distribution of luminous and dark matter in spiral and irregular nearby galaxies using WISE photometry},
  abstract    = {We present the mass distribution of a sample of 121 nearby galaxies with high quality optical velocity fields and available infra-red $\it{WISE}$ 3.4 $\mu$m data. Contrary to previous studies, this sample covers all morphological types and is not biased toward late-type galaxies. These galaxies are part of the Fabry-Perot kinematical $\it{GHASP}$ survey of spirals and irregular nearby galaxies. Combining the kinematical data to the $\it{WISE}$ surface brightness data probing the emission from the old stellar population, we derive mass models allowing us to compare the luminous to the dark matter halo mass distribution in the optical regions of those galaxies. Dark matter (DM) models are constructed using the isothermal core profile and the Navarro-Frenk-White cuspy profile. We allow the M/L of the baryonic disc to vary or we keep it fixed, constrained by stellar evolutionary models (WISE W$_1$-W$_2$ color) and we carry out best fit (BFM) and pseudo-isothermal maximum disc (MDM) models. We found that the MDM provides M/L values four times higher than the BFM, suggesting that disc components, on average, tend to be maximal. The main results are: (i) the rotation curves of most galaxies are better fitted with core rather than cuspy profiles; (ii) the relation between the parameters of the DM and of the luminous matter components mostly depends on morphological types. More precisely, the distribution of the DM inside galaxies depends on whether or not the galaxy has a bulge.},

  abstract    = {We present the Feedback Acting on Baryons in Large-scale Environments (FABLE) suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies, groups and clusters. The simulations use the AREPO moving-mesh code with a set of physical models for galaxy formation based on the successful Illustris simulation, but with updated AGN and supernovae feedback models. This allows us to simultaneously reproduce the observed redshift evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function together with the stellar and gas mass fractions of local groups and clusters across a wide range of halo masses. Focusing on the properties of groups and clusters, we find very good agreement with a range of observed scaling relations, including the X-ray luminosity--total mass and gas mass relations as well as the total mass--temperature and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich flux--mass relations. Careful comparison of our results with scaling relations based on X-ray hydrostatic masses as opposed to weak lensing-derived masses reveals some discrepancies, which hint towards a non-negligible X-ray mass bias in observed samples. We further show that radial profiles of density, pressure and temperature of the simulated intracluster medium are in very good agreement with observations, in particular for $r > 0.3\ r_{500}$. In the innermost regions however we find too large entropy cores, which indicates that a more sophisticated modelling of the physics of AGN feedback may be required to accurately reproduce the observed populations of cool-core and non-cool-core clusters.},

  title       = {New Interpretation of the mass-temperature relation and mass calibration of galaxy clusters based on the fundamental plane},
  abstract    = {Observations and numerical simulations have shown that the relation between the mass scaled with the critical density of the Universe and the X-ray temperature of galaxy clusters is approximately represented by $M_\Delta \propto T_X^{3/2}$ (e.g. $\Delta=500$). This relation is often interpreted as evidence that clusters are in virial equilibrium. However, the recently discovered fundamental plane (FP) of clusters indicates that the temperature of clusters primarily depends on a combination of the characteristic mass $M_s$ and radius $r_s$ of the Navarro-Frenk-White profile rather than $M_\Delta$. Moreover, the angle of the FP revealed that clusters are not in virial equilibrium because of continuous mass accretion from the surrounding matter. By considering both the FP and the mass-dependence of the cluster concentration parameter, we show that this paradox can be solved and the relation $M_\Delta \propto T_X^{3/2}$ actually reflects the central structure of clusters. We also find that the intrinsic scatter in the halo concentration-mass relation can largely account for the spread of clusters on the FP. We also show that X-ray data alone form the FP and the angle and the position are consistent with those of the FP constructed from gravitational-lensing data. We demonstrate that a possible shift between the two FPs can be used to calibrate cluster masses obtained via X-ray observations.},

  title       = {Leaves on trees: identifying halo stars with extreme gradient boosted trees},
  abstract    = {Extended stellar haloes are a natural by-product of the hierarchical formation of massive galaxies. If merging is a non-negligible factor in the growth of our Galaxy, evidence of such events should be encoded in its stellar halo. Reliable identification of genuine halo stars is a challenging task however. The 1st Gaia data release contains the positions, parallaxes and proper motions for over 2 million stars, mostly in the Solar neighbourhood. Gaia DR2 will enlarge this sample to over 1.5 billion stars, the brightest ~5 million of which will have a full phase-space information. Our aim is to develop a machine learning model to reliably identify halo stars, even when their full phase-space information is not available. We use the Gradient Boosted Trees algorithm to build a supervised halo star classifier. The classifier is trained on a sample extracted from the Gaia Universe Model Snapshot, convolved with the errors of TGAS, as well as with the expected uncertainties of the upcoming Gaia DR2. We also trained our classifier on the cross-match between the TGAS and RAVE catalogues, where the halo stars are labelled in an entirely model independent way. We then use this model to identify halo stars in TGAS. When full phase- space information is available and for Gaia DR2-like uncertainties, our classifier is able to recover 90% of the halo stars with at most 30% distance errors, in a completely unseen test set, and with negligible levels of contamination. When line-of-sight velocity is not available, we recover ~60% of such halo stars, with less than 10% contamination. When applied to the TGAS data, our classifier detects 337 high confidence RGB halo stars. Although small, this number is consistent with the expectation from models given the data uncertainties. The large parallax errors are the biggest limitation to identify a larger number of halo stars in all the cases studied.},

We use the Monte Carlo scheme to construct the initial conditions for each cluster, taking into account the uncertainties in the kinematical data and distances. The sample clusters show typically maximum height to the Galactic plane below 1.5 kpc, and develop rather eccentric orbits. Seven of the bulge sample clusters share the orbital properties of the bar/bulge, having perigalactic and apogalatic distances, and maximum vertical excursion from the Galactic plane inside the bar region. NGC 6540 instead shows a completely different orbital behaviour, having a dynamical signature of the thick-disc. Both prograde and prograde-retrograde orbits with respect to the direction of the Galactic rotation were revealed, which might characterize a chaotic behaviour.},

Galaxy Evolution Explorer UV data are used to cleanly divide the sample into star-forming and quenched galaxies and to identify galaxies in transition (the green valley). Despite a stark difference in visual appearance between blue and red galaxies, their average radial stellar mass density profiles are remarkably similar (especially in the outer regions) at fixed mass. The inner stellar mass surface density within a radius of 1 kpc, Σ 1 , is used to quantify the growth of the bulge as galaxies evolve. When galaxies are divided into narrow mass bins, their distribution in the color-Σ 1 plane at fixed mass forms plausible evolutionary tracks. Σ 1 seems to grow as galaxies evolve through the blue cloud, and once it crosses a threshold value, galaxies are seen to quench at fixed Σ 1 . The Σ 1 threshold for quenching grows with stellar mass, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/776/1/63/apj484827ieqn1.gif] {$\Sigma _1\propto M_*^{0.64}$} . However, the existence of some star-forming galaxies above the threshold Σ 1 implies that a dense bulge is necessary but not sufficient to quench a galaxy fully. This would be consistent with a two-step quenching process in which gas within a galaxy is removed or stabilized against star formation by bulge-driven processes (such as a starburst, active galactic nucleus feedback, or morphological quenching), whereas external gas accretion is suppressed by separate halo-driven processes (such as halo gas shock heating). Quenching thus depends on an interplay between the inner structure of a galaxy and its surrounding dark matter halo, and lack of perfect synchrony between the two could produce the observed scatter in color versus Σ 1 .},

  abstract = {The presence of extremely compact galaxies at z ~ 2 and their subsequent growth in physical size has been the cause of much puzzlement. We revisit the question using deep infrared Wide Field Camera 3 data to probe the rest-frame optical structure of 935 galaxies selected with 0.4 < z < 2.5 and stellar masses M * > 10 10.7 M ☉ in the UKIRT Ultra Deep Survey and GOODS-South fields of the CANDELS survey. At each redshift, the most compact sources are those with little or no star formation, and the mean size of these systems at fixed stellar mass grows by a factor of 3.5 ± 0.3 over this redshift interval. The data are sufficiently deep to identify companions to these hosts whose stellar masses are ten times smaller. By searching for these around 404 quiescent hosts within a physical annulus 10 h –1 kpc < R < 30 h –1 kpc, we estimate the minor merger rate over 0.4 < z < 2. We find that 13%-18% of quiescent hosts have likely physical companions with stellar mass ratios of 0.1 or greater. Mergers of these companions will typically increase the host mass by 6% ± 2% per merger timescale. We estimate the minimum growth rate necessary to explain the declining abundance of compact galaxies. Using a simple model motivated by recent numerical simulations, we then assess whether mergers of the faint companions with their hosts are sufficient to explain this minimal rate. We find that mergers may explain most of the size evolution observed at z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 1 if a relatively short merger timescale is assumed, but the rapid growth seen at higher redshift likely requires additional physical processes.},

Employing this capability over all five 3D- HST /CANDELS fields provides a sample of 3200 galaxies enabling a division into subsamples based on stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR). By creating deep stacked H α images, we reach surface brightness limits of 1 × 10 −18 erg s −1 cm −2 arcsec −2 , allowing us to map the distribution of ionized gas to ∼10 kpc for typical L * galaxies at this epoch. We find that the spatial extent of the H α distribution increases with stellar mass as ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/828/1/27/apjaa2d0cieqn1.gif] {${r}_{{\rm{H}}\alpha }=1.5{({M}_{* }/{10}^{10}{M}_{\odot })}^{0.23}$} kpc.

We map the H α distribution as a function of SFR(IR+UV) and find evidence for “coherent star formation” across the SFR– M * plane: above the main sequence (MS), H α is enhanced at all radii; below the MS, H α is depressed at all radii. This suggests that at all masses the physical processes driving the enhancement or suppression of star formation act throughout the disks of galaxies. At high masses ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/828/1/27/apjaa2d0cieqn3.gif] {${10}^{10.5}\lt {M}_{* }/{M}_{\odot }\lt {10}^{11}$} ), above the MS, H α is particularly enhanced in the center, potentially building bulges and/or supermassive black holes. Below the MS, a strong central dip in the EW(H α ), as well as the inferred specific SFR, appears. Importantly, though, across the entirety of the SFR– M * plane, the absolute SFR as traced by H α is always centrally peaked, even in galaxies below the MS.},

  abstract = {The shutdown of star formation in galaxies is generally termed "quenching." Quenching may occur through a variety of processes, e.g., active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, stellar feedback, or the shock heating of gas in the dark matter halo. However, which mechanism(s) is, in fact, responsible for quenching is still in question. This paper addresses quenching by searching for traces of possible quenching processes through their effects on galaxy structural parameters such as stellar mass ( M * ), M * / r e , surface stellar mass density (~ M * / r 2 e ), and Sérsic index ( n ). We analyze the rest-frame U – B color correlations versus these structural parameters using a sample of galaxies in the redshift range 0.5 ≤ z < 0.8 from the DEEP2/AEGIS survey. In addition to global radii, stellar masses, and Sérsic parameters, we also use "bulge" and "disk" photometric measurements from GIM2D fits to HST /ACS V and I images. We assess the tightness of the color relationships by measuring their "overlap regions," defined as the area in color-parameter space in which red and blue galaxies overlap; the parameter that minimizes these overlap regions is considered to be the most effective color discriminator. We find that Sérsic index ( n ) has the smallest overlap region among all tested parameters and resembles a step function with a threshold value of n = 2.3. There exists, however, a significant population of outliers with blue colors yet high n values that seem to contradict this behavior; they make up ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 40% of n > 2.3 galaxies. We hypothesize that their Sérsic values may be distorted by bursts of star formation, AGNs, and/or poor fits, leading us to consider central surface stellar mass density , Σ* 1 kpc , as an alternative to Sérsic index. Not only does Σ* 1 kpc correct the outliers, but it also forms a tight relationship with color, suggesting that the innermost structure of galaxies is most physically linked with quenching . Furthermore, at z ~ 0.65, the majority of the blue cloud galaxies cannot simply fade onto the red sequence since their GIM2D bulge masses are only half as large on average as the bulge masses of similar red sequence galaxies, thus demonstrating that stellar mass must absolutely increase at the centers of galaxies as they quench. We discuss a two-stage model for quenching in which galaxy star formation rates are controlled by their dark halos while they are still in the blue cloud and a second quenching process sets in later, associated with the central stellar mass buildup. The mass buildup is naturally explained by any non-axisymmetric features in the potential, such as those induced by mergers and/or disk instabilities. However, the identity of the second quenching agent is still unknown. We have placed our data catalog online.},

In this paper,we ask when these dense cores were formed and determine how galaxies gradually assembled around them. We select galaxies that have a stellar mass >3 × 10 10 M ☉ inside r = 1 kpc out to z = 2.5, using the 3D-HST survey and data at low redshift. Remarkably, the number density of galaxies with dense cores appears to have decreased from z = 2.5 to the present. This decrease is probably mostly due to stellar mass loss and the resulting adiabatic expansion, with some contribution from merging. We infer that dense cores were mostly formed at z > 2.5, consistent with their largely quiescent stellar populations. While the cores appear to form early, the galaxies in which they reside show strong evolution: their total masses increase by a factor of 2-3 from z = 2.5 to z = 0 and their effective radii increase by a factor of 5-6. As a result, the contribution of dense cores to the total mass of the galaxies in which they reside decreases from ~50% at z = 2.5 to ~15% at z = 0. Because of their early formation, the contribution of dense cores to the total stellar mass budget of the universe is a strong function of redshift. The stars in cores with M 1 kpc > 3 × 10 10 M ☉ make up ~0.1% of the stellar mass density of the universe today but 10%-20% at z ~ 2, depending on their initial mass function. The formation of these cores required the conversion of ~10 11 M ☉ of gas into stars within ~1 kpc, while preventing significant star formation at larger radii.},

When M star is fixed we see that strong trends remain with all other parameters, whereas residual trends are weaker when Σ, n , or σ is fixed. Overall σ is the best indicator of a galaxy's typical color, showing the largest residual color dependence when any of the other three parameters are fixed, and M star is the poorest. Other studies have indicated that both the central black hole mass and possibly host dark matter halo properties (mass or concentration) are also better correlated with σ than with M star , Σ, or n .

The criteria are thoroughly tested with theoretical stellar population synthesis models and real galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts to evaluate their efficiency and contamination. We apply the well-tested VJL criteria to the HST /WFC3 Early Release Science field and study the physical properties of selected galaxies. The redshift distribution of selected SFGs peaks at z ~ 2.7, slightly lower than that of Lyman break galaxies at z ~ 3. Comparing the observed mid-infrared fluxes of selected galaxies with the prediction of pure stellar emission, we find that our VJL method is effective at selecting massive dusty SFGs that are missed by the Lyman break technique. About half of the star formation in massive ( M star > 10 10 M ☉ ) galaxies at 2.3 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 3.5 is contributed by dusty (extinction E ( B – V ) > 0.4) SFGs, which, however, only account for ~20% of the number density of massive SFGs. We also use the mid-infrared fluxes to clean our PEG sample and find that galaxy size can be used as a secondary criterion to effectively eliminate the contamination of dusty SFGs. The redshift distribution of the cleaned PEG sample peaks at z ~ 2.5. We find six PEG candidates at z > 3 and discuss possible methods to distinguish them from dusty contamination. We conclude that at least part of our candidates are real PEGs at z ~ 3, implying that these types of galaxies began to form their stars at z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 5. We measure the integrated stellar mass density (ISMD) of PEGs at z ~ 2.5 and set constraints on it at z > 3.

We measure surface brightness profiles for these galaxies using a method that properly measures low surface brightness flux at large radii. We find that quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2 very closely follow Sérsic profiles, with n median = 3.7, and have no excess flux at large radii. Their effective radii are a factor of ~4 smaller than those of low-redshift quiescent galaxies of similar mass. However, there is a significant spread in sizes ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/749/2/121/apj423213ieqn1.gif] {$\sigma _{\log _{10} r_e} = 0.24$} ), with the largest z ~ 2 galaxies lying close to the z = 0 mass-size relation. We compare the stellar mass surface density profiles with those of massive elliptical galaxies in the Virgo Cluster and confirm that most of the mass growth which occurs between z ~ 2 and z = 0 must be due to accretion of material onto the outer regions of the galaxies. Additionally, we investigate the evolution in the size distribution of massive quiescent galaxies. We find that the minimum size growth required for z ~ 2 quiescent galaxies to fall within the z = 0 size distribution is a factor of ~2 smaller than the total median size growth between z ~ 2 and z = 0.},

Galaxies were selected to be more massive than 10 10 M ☉ and have specific star formation rates (SFRs) above 1/ t H . We model the seven-band optical ACS + near-IR WFC3 spectral energy distributions of individual bins of pixels, accounting simultaneously for the galaxy-integrated photometric constraints available over a longer wavelength range. We analyze variations in rest-frame color, stellar surface mass density, age, and extinction as a function of galactocentric radius and local surface brightness/density, and measure structural parameters on luminosity and stellar mass maps. We find evidence for redder colors, older stellar ages, and increased dust extinction in the nuclei of galaxies. Big star-forming clumps seen in star formation tracers are less prominent or even invisible in the inferred stellar mass distributions. Off-center clumps contribute up to ~20% to the integrated SFR, but only 7% or less to the integrated mass of all massive SFGs at z ~ 1 and z ~ 2, with the fractional contributions being a decreasing function of wavelength used to select the clumps. The stellar mass profiles tend to have smaller sizes and M20 coefficients, and higher concentration and Gini coefficients than the light distribution. Our results are consistent with an inside-out disk growth scenario with brief (100-200 Myr) episodic local enhancements in star formation superposed on the underlying disk. Alternatively, the young ages of off-center clumps may signal inward clump migration, provided this happens efficiently on the order of an orbital timescale.},

We explore the relationship between rest-frame optical color, stellar mass, star formation activity, and galaxy structure. We confirm the dramatic increase from z = 2.2 to the present day in the number density of non-star-forming galaxies above 3 × 10 10 M ☉ reported by others. We further find that the vast majority of these quiescent systems have concentrated light profiles, as parameterized by the Sérsic index, and the population of concentrated galaxies grows similarly rapidly. We examine the joint distribution of star formation activity, Sérsic index, stellar mass, inferred velocity dispersion, and stellar surface density. Quiescence correlates poorly with stellar mass at all z < 2.2. Quiescence correlates well with Sérsic index at all redshifts. Quiescence correlates well with "velocity dispersion" and stellar surface density at z > 1.3, and somewhat less well at lower redshifts. Yet, there is significant scatter between quiescence and galaxy structure: while the vast majority of quiescent galaxies have prominent bulges, many of them have significant disks, and a number of bulge-dominated galaxies have significant star formation. Noting the rarity of quiescent galaxies without prominent bulges, we argue that a prominent bulge (and perhaps, by association, a supermassive black hole) is an important condition for quenching star formation on galactic scales over the last 10 Gyr, in qualitative agreement with the active galactic nucleus feedback paradigm.},

  abstract = {The presence of massive, compact, quiescent galaxies at z >2 presents a major challenge for theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution. Using one of the deepest large public near-IR surveys to date, we investigate in detail the correlations between star formation and galaxy structural parameters (size, stellar mass, and surface density) from z = 2 to the present. At all redshifts, massive quiescent galaxies (i.e., those with little or no star formation) occupy the extreme high end of the surface density distribution and follow a tight mass-size correlation, while star-forming galaxies show a broad range of both densities and sizes. Conversely, galaxies with the highest surface densities comprise a nearly homogeneous population with little or no ongoing star formation, while less dense galaxies exhibit high star formation rates and varying levels of dust obscuration. Both the sizes and surface densities of quiescent galaxies evolve strongly from z = 2-0; we parameterize this evolution for both populations with simple power-law functions and present best-fit parameters for comparison to future theoretical models. Higher-mass quiescent galaxies undergo faster structural evolution, consistent with previous results. Interestingly, star-forming galaxies' sizes and densities evolve at rates similar to those of quiescent galaxies. It is therefore possible that the same physical processes drive the structural evolution of both populations, suggesting that "dry mergers" may not be the sole culprit in this size evolution.},

  abstract = {Using a high-resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulation of the formation of a massive spheroidal galaxy we show that elliptical galaxies can be very compact and massive at high redshift in agreement with recent observations. Accretion of stripped infalling stellar material increases the size of the system with time and the central concentration is reduced by dynamical friction of the surviving stellar cores. In a specific case of a spheroidal galaxy with a final stellar mass of 1.5 × 10 11 M ☉ we find that the effective radius r e increases from 0.7 ± 0.2 kpc at z = 3 to r e = 2.4 ± 0.4 kpc at z = 0 with a concomitant decrease in the effective density of an order of magnitude and a decrease of the central velocity dispersion by approximately 20% over this time interval. A simple argument based on the virial theorem shows that during the accretion of weakly bound material (minor mergers) the radius can increase as the square of the mass in contrast to the usual linear rate of increase for major mergers. By undergoing minor mergers compact high-redshift spheroids can evolve into present-day systems with sizes and concentrations similar to observed local ellipticals. This indicates that minor mergers may be the main driver for the late evolution of sizes and densities of early-type galaxies.},

In total, our sample contains structural data for 465 galaxies (mainly early-type) in the redshift range 0.2 < z < 2.7. The size evolution of passively evolving galaxies over this redshift range is gradual and continuous, with no evidence for an end or change to the process around z ~ 1, as has been hinted at by some surveys which analyze subsets of the data in isolation.

The number density of local compact galaxies with luminosity weighted (LW) ages compatible with being already passive at high redshift is compared with the density of compact passive galaxies observed at high- z . Our results place an upper limit of a factor ~2 on the evolution of the number density and are inconsistent with a significant size evolution for most of the compact galaxies observed at high- z . Instead, the evolution may be significant (up to a factor five) for the most extreme, ultracompact galaxies. Considering all compact galaxies, regardless of LW age and star formation activity, a minority of local compact galaxies (≤1/3) might have formed at z < 1. Finally, we show that the secular decrease of the galaxy stellar mass due to simple stellar evolution may in some cases be a non-negligible factor in the context of the evolution of the mass-size relation, and we caution that passive evolution in mass should be taken into account when comparing samples at different redshifts.},

  abstract = {We explore the simple inter-relationships between mass, star formation rate, and environment in the SDSS, zCOSMOS, and other deep surveys. We take a purely empirical approach in identifying those features of galaxy evolution that are demanded by the data and then explore the analytic consequences of these. We show that the differential effects of mass and environment are completely separable to z ~ 1, leading to the idea of two distinct processes of "mass quenching" and "environment quenching." The effect of environment quenching, at fixed over-density, evidently does not change with epoch to z ~ 1 in zCOSMOS, suggesting that the environment quenching occurs as large-scale structure develops in the universe, probably through the cessation of star formation in 30%-70% of satellite galaxies. In contrast, mass quenching appears to be a more dynamic process, governed by a quenching rate. We show that the observed constancy of the Schechter M * and α s for star-forming galaxies demands that the quenching of galaxies around and above M * must follow a rate that is statistically proportional to their star formation rates (or closely mimic such a dependence). We then postulate that this simple mass-quenching law in fact holds over a much broader range of stellar mass (2 dex) and cosmic time. We show that the combination of these two quenching processes, plus some additional quenching due to merging naturally produces (1) a quasi-static single Schechter mass function for star-forming galaxies with an exponential cutoff at a value M * that is set uniquely by the constant of proportionality between the star formation and mass quenching rates and (2) a double Schechter function for passive galaxies with two components. The dominant component (at high masses) is produced by mass quenching and has exactly the same M * as the star-forming galaxies but a faint end slope that differs by Δα s ~ 1. The other component is produced by environment effects and has the same M * and α s as the star-forming galaxies but an amplitude that is strongly dependent on environment. Subsequent merging of quenched galaxies will modify these predictions somewhat in the denser environments, mildly increasing M * and making α s slightly more negative. All of these detailed quantitative inter-relationships between the Schechter parameters of the star-forming and passive galaxies, across a broad range of environments, are indeed seen to high accuracy in the SDSS, lending strong support to our simple empirically based model. We find that the amount of post-quenching "dry merging" that could have occurred is quite constrained. Our model gives a prediction for the mass function of the population of transitory objects that are in the process of being quenched. Our simple empirical laws for the cessation of star formation in galaxies also naturally produce the "anti-hierarchical" run of mean age with mass for passive galaxies, as well as the qualitative variation of formation timescale indicated by the relative α-element abundances.},

The SMFs of the combined population are in good agreement with previous measurements and show that the stellar mass density of the universe was only 50%, 10%, and 1% of its current value at z ~ 0.75, 2.0, and 3.5, respectively. The quiescent population drives most of the overall growth, with the stellar mass density of these galaxies increasing as ρ star ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} (1 + z ) –4.7 ± 0.4 since z = 3.5, whereas the mass density of star-forming galaxies increases as ρ star ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} (1 + z ) –2.3 ± 0.2 . At z > 2.5, star-forming galaxies dominate the total SMF at all stellar masses, although a non-zero population of quiescent galaxies persists to z = 4. Comparisons of the K s -selected star-forming galaxy SMFs with UV-selected SMFs at 2.5 < z < 4 show reasonable agreement and suggest that UV-selected samples are representative of the majority of the stellar mass density at z > 3.5. We estimate the average mass growth of individual galaxies by selecting galaxies at fixed cumulative number density. The average galaxy with log( M star / M ☉ ) = 11.5 at z = 0.3 has grown in mass by only 0.2 dex (0.3 dex) since z = 2.0 (3.5), whereas those with log( M star / M ☉ ) = 10.5 have grown by >1.0 dex since z = 2. At z < 2, the time derivatives of the mass growth are always larger for lower-mass galaxies, which demonstrates that the mass growth in galaxies since that redshift is mass-dependent and primarily bottom-up. Lastly, we examine potential sources of systematic uncertainties in the SMFs and find that those from photo- z templates, stellar population synthesis modeling, and the definition of quiescent galaxies dominate the total error budget in the SMFs.},

The observed spectral energy distributions show pronounced breaks, sampled by a set of near-IR medium-bandwidth filters, resulting in tightly constrained photometric redshifts. Fitting stellar population models suggests large Balmer/4000 Å breaks, relatively old stellar populations, large stellar masses, and low SFRs, with a median specific SFR of 2.9 ± 1.8 × 10 –11 yr –1 . Ultradeep Herschel /PACS 100 μm, 160 μm and Spitzer /MIPS 24 μm data reveal no dust-obscured SFR activity for 15/19(79%) galaxies. Two far-IR detected galaxies are obscured QSOs. Stacking the far-IR undetected galaxies yields no detection, consistent with the spectral energy distribution fit, indicating independently that the average specific SFR is at least 10 × smaller than that of typical star-forming galaxies at z ~ 4. Assuming all far-IR undetected galaxies are indeed quiescent, the volume density is 1.8 ± 0.7 × 10 –5 Mpc –3 to a limit of log 10 M / M ☉ ≥ 10.6, which is 10 × and 80 × lower than at z = 2 and z = 0.1. They comprise a remarkably high fraction (~35%) of z ~ 4 massive galaxies, suggesting that suppression of star formation was efficient even at very high redshift. Given the average stellar age of 0.8 Gyr and stellar mass of 0.8 × 10 11 M ☉ , the galaxies likely started forming stars before z = 5, with SFRs well in excess of 100 M ☉ yr –1 , far exceeding that of similarly abundant UV-bright galaxies at z ≥ 4. This suggests that most of the star formation in the progenitors of quiescent z ~ 4 galaxies was obscured by dust.},

ZFOURGE provides well-constrained photometric redshifts made possible through deep medium-bandwidth imaging at 1-2 μm. We combine this with Hubble Space Telescope imaging from the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey, allowing for the efficient selection of both blue and red galaxies down to stellar masses of ~10 9.5 M ☉ at z ~ 2.5. The total surveyed area is 316 arcmin 2 distributed over three independent fields. We supplement these data with the wider and shallower NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey to provide stronger constraints at high masses. Several studies at z ≤ 1.5 have revealed a steepening of the slope at the low-mass end of the SMF, leading to an upturn at masses <10 10 M ☉ that is not well described by a standard single-Schechter function. We find evidence that this feature extends to at least z ~ 2 and that it can be found in both the star-forming and quiescent populations individually. The characteristic mass ( M *) and slope at the lowest masses (α) of a double-Schechter function fit to the SMF stay roughly constant at Log( M / M ☉ ) ~ 10.65 and ~ – 1.5, respectively. The SMF of star-forming galaxies has evolved primarily in normalization, while the change in shape is relatively minor. Our data allow us, for the first time, to observe a rapid buildup at the low-mass end of the quiescent SMF. Since z = 2.5, the total stellar mass density of quiescent galaxies (down to 10 9 M ☉ ) has increased by a factor of ~12, whereas the mass density of star-forming galaxies only increases by a factor of ~2.2.},

We determine the UV-continuum slope β in these galaxies, and compare the slopes with galaxies at later times to measure the evolution in β. For luminous L * z =3 galaxies, we measure a mean UV-continuum slope β of –2.0 ± 0.2, which is comparable to the β ~ –2 derived at similar luminosities at z ~ 5-6. However, for the lower luminosity 0.1 L * z =3 galaxies, we measure a mean β of –3.0 ± 0.2. This is substantially bluer than is found for similar luminosity galaxies at z ~ 4, just 800 Myr later, and even at z ~ 5-6. In principle, the observed β of –3.0 can be matched by a very young, dust-free stellar population, but when nebular emission is included the expected β becomes ≥–2.7. To produce these very blue βs (i.e., β ~ –3), extremely low metallicities and mechanisms to reduce the red nebular emission seem to be required. For example, a large escape fraction (i.e., f esc ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 0.3) could minimize the contribution from this red nebular emission. If this is correct and the escape fraction in faint z ~ 7 galaxies is ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 0.3, it may help to explain how galaxies reionize the universe.},

Two similarly bright sources are also detected in a reanalysis of the GOODS-S data set. Three of the four galaxies in GOODS-N are significantly detected at 4.5σ-6.2σ in the very deep Spitzer /IRAC 4.5 μm data, as is one of the GOODS-S candidates. Furthermore, the brightest of our candidates (at z = 10.2 ± 0.4) is robustly detected also at 3.6 μm (6.9σ), revealing a flat UV spectral energy distribution with a slope β = –2.0 ± 0.2, consistent with demonstrated trends with luminosity at high redshift. Thorough testing and use of grism data excludes known low-redshift contamination at high significance, including single emission-line sources, but as-yet unknown low redshift sources could provide an alternative solution given the surprising luminosity of these candidates. Finding such bright galaxies at z ~ 9-10 suggests that the luminosity function for luminous galaxies might evolve in a complex way at z > 8. The cosmic star formation rate density still shows, however, an order-of-magnitude increase from z ~ 10 to z ~ 8 since the dominant contribution comes from low-luminosity sources. Based on the IRAC detections, we derive galaxy stellar masses at z ~ 10, finding that these luminous objects are typically 10 9 M ☉ . This allows for a first estimate of the cosmic stellar mass density at z ~ 10 resulting in ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/786/2/108/apj491415ieqn1.gif] {$\log _{10}\rho _{*} = 4.7^{+0.5}_{-0.8}$} M ☉ Mpc –3 for galaxies brighter than M UV ~ –18.

Existing deep observations from the Chandra X-Ray Observatory and ground-based facilities are supplemented with new, deep imaging in the optical and near-infrared from the European Southern Observatory and from the Kitt Peak National Observatory. Deep observations with the Space Infrared Telescope Facility are scheduled. Reduced data from all facilities are being released worldwide within 3-6 months of acquisition. Together, this data set provides two deep reference fields for studies of distant normal and active galaxies, supernovae, and faint stars in our own Galaxy. This Letter serves to outline the survey strategy and describe the specific data that have been used in the accompanying letters, summarizing the reduction procedures and sensitivity limits.},

  abstract = {We present Hubble Space Telescope NIC2 morphologies of a spectroscopic sample of massive galaxies at z ~ 2.3 by extending our sample of 9 compact quiescent galaxies ( r e ~ 0.9 kpc) with 10 massive emission-line galaxies. The emission-line galaxies are classified by the nature of their ionized emission; there are six star-forming galaxies and four galaxies hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The star-forming galaxies are the largest among the emission-line galaxies, with a median size of r e = 2.8 kpc. The three galaxies with the highest star formation rates ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 100 M ☉ yr –1 ) have irregular and clumpy morphologies. The AGN host galaxies are more similar to the compact quiescent galaxies in terms of their structures ( r e ~ 1.1 kpc) and spectral energy distributions. The total sample clearly separates into two classes in a color-mass diagram: the large star-forming galaxies that form the blue cloud, and the compact quiescent galaxies on the red sequence. However, it is unclear how or even if the two classes are evolutionary related. Three out of six massive star-forming galaxies have dense cores and thus may passively evolve into compact galaxies due to fading of outer star-forming regions. For these galaxies, a reverse scenario in which compact galaxies grow inside-out by star formation is also plausible. We do caution though that the sample is small. Nonetheless, it is evident that a Hubble sequence of massive galaxies with strongly correlated galaxy properties is already in place at z > 2.},

For 2905 field galaxies, complete to 10 10 (10 10.8 ) M ☉ at z < 0.7(1), with Keck spectroscopic redshifts out to z = 1.1, we compile SF rates (SFRs) from emission lines, GALEX , and Spitzer MIPS 24 μm photometry, optical-NIR M * measurements, and HST morphologies. Galaxies with reliable signs of SF form a distinct "main sequence" (MS), with a limited range of SFRs at a given M * and z (1 σ ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} ±0.3 dex), and log(SFR) approximately proportional to log M * . The range of log(SFR) remains constant to z > 1, while the MS as a whole moves to higher SFR as z increases. The range of the SFR along the MS constrains the amplitude of episodic variations of SF and the effect of mergers on the SFR. Typical galaxies spend ~67%(95%) of their lifetime since z = 1 within a factor of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} 2(4) of their average SFR at a given M * and z . The dominant mode of the evolution of SF since z ~ 1 is apparently a gradual decline of the average SFR in most individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of starburst episodes, or a decreasing factor by which SFRs are enhanced in starbursts. LIRGs at z ~ 1 seem to mostly reflect the high SFR typical for massive galaxies at that epoch. The smooth MS may reflect that the same set of few physical processes governs SF prior to additional quenching processes. A gradual process like gas exhaustion may play a dominant role.},

We use a sample of BzK-selected star-forming galaxies, drawn from the Cosmic Evolution Survey, to perform a stacking analysis of their 1.4 GHz radio continuum as a function of different stellar population properties, after cleaning the sample from contamination by active galactic nuclei. Dust unbiased SFRs are derived from radio fluxes assuming the local radio-IR correlation. The main results of this work are: (1) specific star formation rate (SSFR)s are constant over about 1 dex in stellar mass and up to the highest stellar mass probed, (2) the dust attenuation is a strong function of galaxy stellar mass with more massive galaxies being more obscured than lower mass objects, (3) a single value of the UV extinction applied to all galaxies would lead to a gross underestimate of the SFR in massive galaxies, (4) correcting the observed UV luminosities for dust attenuation based on the Calzetti recipe provides results in very good agreement with the radio derived ones, (5) the mean SSFR of our sample steadily decreases by a factor of ~4 with decreasing redshift from z = 2.3 to 1.4 and a factor of ~40 down the local universe. These empirical SFRs would cause galaxies to dramatically overgrow in mass if maintained all the way to low redshifts; we suggest that this does not happen because star formation is progressively quenched, likely starting from the most massive galaxies.},

  abstract = {We compare multi-wavelength star formation rate (SFR) indicators out to z ~ 3 in the GOODS-South field. Our analysis uniquely combines U to 8 μm photometry from FIREWORKS, MIPS 24 μm and PACS 70, 100, and 160 μm photometry from the PEP, and H α spectroscopy from the SINS survey. We describe a set of conversions that lead to a continuity across SFR indicators. A luminosity-independent conversion from 24 μm to total infrared luminosity yields estimates of L IR that are in the median consistent with the L IR derived from PACS photometry, albeit with significant scatter. Dust correction methods perform well at low-to-intermediate levels of star formation. They fail to recover the total amount of star formation in systems with large SFR IR /SFR UV ratios, typically occuring at the highest SFRs (SFR UV + IR ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 100 M ☉ yr –1 ) and redshifts ( z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 2.5) probed. Finally, we confirm that H α-based SFRs at 1.5 < z < 2.6 are consistent with SFR SED and SFR UV + IR provided extra attenuation toward H II regions is taken into account ( A V , neb = A V , continuum /0.44). With the cross-calibrated SFR indicators in hand, we perform a consistency check on the star formation histories inferred from spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. We compare the observed SFR -M relations and mass functions at a range of redshifts to equivalents that are computed by evolving lower redshift galaxies backward in time. We find evidence for underestimated stellar ages when no stringent constraints on formation epoch are applied in SED modeling. We demonstrate how resolved SED modeling, or alternatively deep UV data, may help to overcome this bias. The age bias is most severe for galaxies with young stellar populations and reduces toward older systems. Finally, our analysis suggests that SFHs typically vary on timescales that are long (at least several 100 Myr) compared to the galaxies' dynamical time.},

This selection excludes red, dusty, star-forming galaxies with higher masses, which brings down the slope. By selecting on L IR / L UV (a proxy for dust obscuration) and the rest-frame U – V colors, we show that star-forming galaxies fall in three distinct regions of the log(SFR)-log( M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sstarf.gif] {sstarf} ) plane: (1) actively star-forming galaxies with "normal" dust obscuration and associated colors (54% for log ( M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sstarf.gif] {sstarf} ) > 10 at 1 < z < 1.5), (2) red star-forming galaxies with low levels of dust obscuration and low-specific SFRs (11%), and (3) dusty, blue star-forming galaxies with high-specific SFRs (7%). The remaining 28% comprises quiescent galaxies. Galaxies on the "normal" star formation sequence show strong trends of increasing dust attenuation with stellar mass and a decreasing specific SFR, with an observed scatter of 0.25 dex. The dusty, blue galaxies reside in the upper envelope of the star formation sequence with remarkably similar spectral shapes at all masses, suggesting that the same physical process is dominating the stellar light. The red, low-dust star-forming galaxies may be in the process of shutting off and migrating to the quiescent population.},

  abstract = {We explore star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies based on the evolution of the star formation rate stellar mass relation (SFR– M * ). Using data from the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE) in combination with far-IR imaging from the Spitzer and Herschel observatories we measure the SFR– M * relation at 0.5 < z < 4. Similar to recent works we find that the average infrared spectral energy distributions of galaxies are roughly consistent with a single infrared template across a broad range of redshifts and stellar masses, with evidence for only weak deviations. We find that the SFR– M * relation is not consistent with a single power law of the form ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/817/2/118/apj521239ieqn1.gif] {$\mathrm{SFR}\propto {M}_{*}^{\alpha }$} at any redshift; it has a power law slope of α ∼ 1 at low masses, and becomes shallower above a turnover mass ( M 0 ) that ranges from 10 9.5 to 10 10.8 M ⊙ , with evidence that M 0 increases with redshift. We compare our measurements to results from state-of-the-art cosmological simulations, and find general agreement in the slope of the SFR– M * relation albeit with systematic offsets. We use the evolving SFR– M * sequence to generate SFHs, finding that typical SFRs of individual galaxies rise at early times and decline after reaching a peak. This peak occurs earlier for more massive galaxies. We integrate these SFHs to generate mass growth histories and compare to the implied mass growth from the evolution of the stellar mass function (SMF). We find that these two estimates are in broad qualitative agreement, but that there is room for improvement at a more detailed level. At early times the SFHs suggest mass growth rates that are as much as 10× higher than inferred from the SMF. However, at later times the SFHs under-predict the inferred evolution, as is expected in the case of additional growth due to mergers.},

Throughout this study our emphasis is on the properties of galaxies on and off of a local "star-forming sequence." We discuss how the physical characteristics of galaxies along this sequence are related to scaling relations typically derived for galaxies of different morphological types. We find, among other trends, that our measure of the star formation rate surface density, Σ SFR , is nearly constant along this sequence. We discuss this result and implications for galaxies at higher redshift. For the first time, we report on measurements of the local UV luminosity function versus galaxy structural parameters, as well as inclination. We also split our sample into disk-dominated and bulge-dominated subsamples using the i -band Sersic index and find that disk-dominated galaxies occupy a very tight locus in SFR/ M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/star.gif] {star} vs. M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/star.gif] {star} space, while bulge-dominated galaxies display a much larger spread of SFR/ M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/star.gif] {star} at fixed stellar mass. A significant fraction of galaxies with SFR/ M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/star.gif] {star} and Σ SFR above those on the "star-forming sequence" are bulge-dominated. We can use our derived distribution functions to ask whether a significant fraction of these galaxies may be experiencing a final episode of star formation (possibly induced by a merger or other burst), soon to be quenched, by determining whether this population can explain the growth rate of the non-star-forming galaxies on the "red sequence." We find that this is a plausible scenario for bulge-dominated galaxies near the characteristic transition mass under reasonable assumptions regarding quenching timescales. Similarly, we use this technique to estimate the rate of mergers/starbursts that take galaxies off of the star-forming sequence and show that the implied merger rates are consistent with local measurements.},

  abstract = {One of the central features of the last 8-10 billion years of cosmic history has been the emergence of a well-populated red sequence of non-star-forming galaxies. A number of models of galaxy formation and evolution have been devised to attempt to explain this behavior. Most current models require feedback from supermassive black holes (AGN feedback) to quench star formation in galaxies in the centers of their dark matter halos (central galaxies). Such models make the strong prediction that all quenched central galaxies must have a large supermassive black hole (and, by association, a prominent bulge component). I show using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey that the observations are consistent with this prediction. Over 99.5% of red-sequence galaxies with stellar masses in excess of 10 10 M ☉ have a prominent bulge component (as defined by having a Sérsic index n above 1.5). Those very rare red-sequence central galaxies with little or no bulge ( n < 1.5) usually have detectable star formation or AGN activity; the fraction of truly quenched bulgeless central galaxies is <0.1% of the total red-sequence population. I conclude that a bulge, and by implication a supermassive black hole, is an absolute requirement for full quenching of star formation in central galaxies. This is in agreement with the most basic prediction of the AGN feedback paradigm.},

We take these findings—which suggest that quenching is the natural downturn of all SFHs affecting galaxies at rates/times correlated with their densities—to mean that: (1) models in which galaxies are diversified on Hubble timescales by something like initial conditions rival the dominant grow-and-quench framework as good descriptions of the data; or (2) absent spatial information, many metrics of galaxy evolution are too undiscriminating—if not inherently misleading—to confirm a unique explanation. We outline future tests of our model but stress that, even if ultimately incorrect, it illustrates how exploring different paradigms can aid learning and, we hope, more detailed modeling efforts.},

However, in contrast with some simulations, there is only a weak relation between star formation rate (SFR) and size within the star-forming population: when dividing into quartiles based on residual offsets in SFR, we find that the sizes of star-forming galaxies in the lowest quartile are 0.27 ± 0.06 dex smaller than the highest quartile.

Taken together, these results suggest that there is an abrupt cessation of star formation after galaxies attain particular structural properties. Confirming earlier results, we find that central stellar density within a 1 kpc fixed physical radius is the key parameter connecting galaxy morphology and star formation histories: galaxies with high central densities are red and have increasingly lower SFR/ ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/838/1/19/apjaa6258ieqn3.gif] {${M}_{\star }$} , whereas galaxies with low central densities are blue and have a roughly constant (higher) SFR/ ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/838/1/19/apjaa6258ieqn4.gif] {${M}_{\star }$} at a given redshift.

Structural measurements for all but the z ~ 0.1 galaxies are based on Hubble Space Telescope imaging, and SFRs are derived using a Herschel -calibrated ladder of SFR indicators. We find that a correlation between the structure and stellar population of galaxies (i.e., a "Hubble sequence") is already in place since at least z ~ 2.5. At all epochs, typical star-forming galaxies on the main sequence are well approximated by exponential disks, while the profiles of quiescent galaxies are better described by de Vaucouleurs profiles. In the upper envelope of the main sequence, the relation between the SFR and Sérsic index reverses, suggesting a rapid buildup of the central mass concentration in these starbursting outliers. We observe quiescent, moderately and highly star-forming systems to co-exist over an order of magnitude or more in stellar mass. At each mass and redshift, galaxies on the main sequence have the largest size. The rate of size growth correlates with specific SFR, and so does Σ SFR at each redshift. A simple model using an empirically determined star formation law and metallicity scaling, in combination with an assumed geometry for dust and stars, is able to relate the observed Σ SFR and SFR IR /SFR UV , provided a more patchy dust geometry is assumed for high-redshift galaxies.},

  abstract = {We study the structural evolution of massive galaxies by linking progenitors and descendants at a constant cumulative number density of n c = 1.4 × 10 –4 Mpc –3 to z ~ 3. Structural parameters were measured by fitting Sérsic profiles to high-resolution CANDELS HST WFC3 J 125 and H 160 imaging in the UKIDSS-UDS at 1 < z < 3 and ACS I 814 imaging in COSMOS at 0.25 < z < 1. At a given redshift, we selected the HST band that most closely samples a common rest-frame wavelength so as to minimize systematics from color gradients in galaxies. At fixed n c , galaxies grow in stellar mass by a factor of ~3 from z ~ 3 to z ~ 0. The size evolution is complex: galaxies appear roughly constant in size from z ~ 3 to z ~ 2 and then grow rapidly to lower redshifts. The evolution in the surface mass density profiles indicates that most of the mass at r < 2 kpc was in place by z ~ 2, and that most of the new mass growth occurred at larger radii. This inside-out mass growth is therefore responsible for the larger sizes and higher Sérsic indices of the descendants toward low redshift. At z < 2, the effective radius evolves with the stellar mass as r e ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} M 2.0 , consistent with scenarios that find dissipationless minor mergers to be a key driver of size evolution. The progenitors at z ~ 3 were likely star-forming disks with r e ~ 2 kpc, based on their low Sérsic index of n ~ 1, low median axis ratio of b / a ~ 0.52, and typical location in the star-forming region of the U – V versus V – J diagram. By z ~ 1.5, many of these star-forming disks disappeared, giving rise to compact quiescent galaxies. Toward lower redshifts, these galaxies continued to assemble mass at larger radii and became the local ellipticals that dominate the high-mass end of the mass function at the present epoch.},

  abstract = {Using public data from the NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey (NMBS) and the Cosmic Assembly Near-Infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS), we investigate the population of massive galaxies at z > 3. The main aim of this work is to identify the potential progenitors of z ~ 2 compact, massive, quiescent galaxies (CMQGs), furthering our understanding of the onset and evolution of massive galaxies. Our work is enabled by high-resolution images from CANDELS data and accurate photometric redshifts, stellar masses, and star formation rates (SFRs) from 37-band NMBS photometry. The total number of massive galaxies at z > 3 is consistent with the number of massive, quiescent galaxies (MQGs) at z ~ 2, implying that the SFRs for all of these galaxies must be much lower by z ~ 2. We discover four CMQGs at z > 3, pushing back the time for which such galaxies have been observed. However, the volume density for these galaxies is significantly less than that of galaxies at z < 2 with similar masses, SFRs, and sizes, implying that additional CMQGs must be created in the intervening ~1 Gyr between z = 3 and z = 2. We find five star-forming galaxies at z ~ 3 that are compact ( R e 10 10.6 M ☉ ; these galaxies are likely to become members of the massive, quiescent, compact galaxy population at z ~ 2. We evolve the stellar masses and SFRs of each individual z > 3 galaxy adopting five different star formation histories (SFHs) and studying the resulting population of massive galaxies at z = 2.3. We find that declining or truncated SFHs are necessary to match the observed number density of MQGs at z ~ 2, whereas a constant delayed-exponential SFH would result in a number density significantly smaller than observed. All of our assumed SFHs imply number densities of CMQGs at z ~ 2 that are consistent with the observed number density. Better agreement with the observed number density of CMQGs at z ~ 2 is obtained if merging is included in the analysis and better still if star formation quenching is assumed to shortly follow the merging event, as implied by recent models of the formation of MQGs.},

This galaxy, GOODS-N-774, has a stellar mass of 100 billion solar masses, a half-light radius of 1.0 kiloparsecs and a star formation rate of  solar masses per year. The star-forming gas has a velocity dispersion of 317 +/- 30 kilometres per second. This is similar to the stellar velocity dispersions of the putative descendants of GOODS-N-774, which are compact quiescent galaxies at z \~{} 2 (refs 8, 9, 10, 11) and giant elliptical galaxies in the nearby Universe. Galaxies such as GOODS-N-774 seem to be rare; however, from the star formation rate and size of this galaxy we infer that many star-forming cores may be heavily obscured, and could be missed in optical and near-infrared surveys.},

  abstract = {We use GOODS and CANDELS images to identify progenitors of massive ( M > 10 10 M ☉ ) compact early-type galaxies (ETGs) at z ~ 1.6. Because merging and accretion increase the size of the stellar component of galaxies, if the progenitors are among known star-forming galaxies, these must be compact themselves. We select candidate progenitors among compact Lyman-break galaxies at z ~ 3 on the basis of their mass, star-formation rate (SFR), and central stellar density, and we find that these account for a large fraction of, and possibly all, compact ETGs at z ~ 1.6. We find that the average far-UV spectral energy distribution (SED) of the candidates is redder than that of the non-candidates, but the optical and mid-IR SED are the same, implying that the redder UV of the candidates is inconsistent with larger dust obscuration and consistent with more evolved (aging) star formation. This is in line with other evidence suggesting that compactness is a sensitive predictor of passivity among high-redshift massive galaxies. We also find that the light distribution of both the compact ETGs and their candidate progenitors does not show any extended "halos" surrounding the compact "core,"both in individual images and in stacks. We argue that this is generally inconsistent with the morphology of merger remnants, even if gas rich, as predicted by N -body simulations. This suggests that the compact ETGs formed via highly dissipative, mostly gaseous accretion of units whose stellar components are very small and undetected in the Hubble Space Telescope images, with their stellar mass assembling in situ, and that they have not experienced any major merging until the epoch of observations at z ~ 1.6.},

Our laser guide star adaptive optics and good seeing data show the presence of turbulent rotating star-forming outer rings/disks, plus central bulge/inner disk components, whose mass fractions relative to the total dynamical mass appear to scale with the [N II]/Hα flux ratio and the star formation age. We propose that the buildup of the central disks and bulges of massive galaxies at z ~ 2 can be driven by the early secular evolution of gas-rich proto-disks. High-redshift disks exhibit large random motions. This turbulence may in part be stirred up by the release of gravitational energy in the rapid "cold" accretion flows along the filaments of the cosmic web. As a result, dynamical friction and viscous processes proceed on a timescale of <1 Gyr, at least an order of magnitude faster than in z ~ 0 disk galaxies. Early secular evolution thus drives gas and stars into the central regions and can build up exponential disks and massive bulges, even without major mergers. Secular evolution along with increased efficiency of star formation at high surface densities may also help to account for the short timescales of the stellar buildup observed in massive galaxies at z ~ 2.},

  abstract = {Although giant clumps of stars are thought to be crucial to galaxy formation and evolution, the most basic demographics of clumps are still uncertain, mainly because the definition of clumps has not been thoroughly discussed. In this paper, we carry out a study of the basic demographics of clumps in star-forming galaxies at 0.5 < z < 3, using our proposed physical definition that UV-bright clumps are discrete star-forming regions that individually contribute more than 8% of the rest-frame UV light of their galaxies. Clumps defined this way are significantly brighter than theH II regions of nearby large spiral galaxies, either individually or blended, when physical spatial resolution and cosmological dimming are considered. Under this definition, we measure the fraction of star-forming galaxies that have at least one off-center clump ( f clumpy ) and the contributions of clumps to the rest-frame UV light and star formation rate (SFR) of star-forming galaxies in the CANDELS/GOODS-S and UDS fields, where our mass-complete sample consists of 3239 galaxies with axial ratio q > 0.5. The redshift evolution of f clumpy changes with the stellar mass ( M * ) of the galaxies. Low-mass (log ( M * / M ☉ ) < 9.8) galaxies keep an almost constant f clumpy of ~60% from z ~ 3 to z ~ 0.5. Intermediate-mass and massive galaxies drop their f clumpy from 55% at z ~ 3 to 40% and 15%, respectively, at z ~ 0.5. We find that (1) the trend of disk stabilization predicted by violent disk instability matches the f clumpy trend of massive galaxies; (2) minor mergers are a viable explanation of the f clumpy trend of intermediate-mass galaxies at z < 1.5, given a realistic observability timescale; and (3) major mergers are unlikely responsible for the f clumpy trend in all masses at z < 1.5. The clump contribution to the rest-frame UV light of star-forming galaxies shows a broad peak around galaxies with log ( M * / M ☉ ) ~ 10.5 at all redshifts. The clump contribution in the intermediate-mass and massive galaxies is possibly linked to the molecular gas fraction of the galaxies. The clump contribution to the SFR of star-forming galaxies, generally around 4%-10%, also shows dependence on the galaxy M * , but for a given galaxy M * , its dependence on the redshift is mild.},

Our results are based on multi-configuration CO[2-1] observations obtained at the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer. All six star-forming galaxies observed were detected at high significance. High spatial resolution observations resolve the CO emission in four of them, implying sizes of the gas reservoirs of order of 6-11 kpc and suggesting the presence of ordered rotation. The galaxies have UV morphologies consistent with clumpy, unstable disks, and UV sizes that are consistent with those measured in CO. The star formation efficiencies are homogeneously low within the sample and similar to those of local spirals—the resulting gas depletion times are ~0.5 Gyr, much higher than what is seen in high- z submillimeter galaxies and quasars. The CO luminosities can be predicted to within 0.15 dex from the observed star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses, implying a tight correlation of the gas mass with these quantities. We use new dynamical models of clumpy disk galaxies to derive dynamical masses for our sample. These models are able to reproduce the peculiar spectral line shapes of the CO emission. After accounting for the stellar and dark matter masses, we derive molecular gas reservoirs with masses of (0.4-1.2)×10 11 M ☉ . The implied conversion (CO luminosity-to-gas mass) factor is very high: α CO = 3.6 ± 0.8, consistent with a Galactic conversion factor but 4 times higher than that of local ultra-luminous IR galaxies that is typically used for high-redshift objects. The gas mass in these galaxies is comparable to or larger than the stellar mass, and the gas accounts for an impressive 50%-65% of the baryons within the galaxies' half-light radii. We are thus witnessing truly gas-dominated galaxies at z ~ 1.5, a finding that explains the high specific SFRs observed for z > 1 galaxies. The BzK galaxies can be viewed as scaled-up versions of local disk galaxies, with low-efficiency star formation taking place inside extended, low-excitation gas disks. These galaxies are markedly different than local ULIRGs and high- z submillimeter galaxies and quasars, where higher excitation and more compact gas is found.},

  abstract      = {Stars form from cold molecular interstellar gas. As this is relatively rare in the local Universe, galaxies like the Milky Way form only a few new stars per year. Typical massive galaxies in the distant Universe formed stars an order of magnitude more rapidly. Unless star formation was significantly more efficient, this difference suggests that young galaxies were much more molecular-gas rich. Molecular gas observations in the distant Universe have so far largely been restricted to very luminous, rare objects, including mergers and quasars, and accordingly we do not yet have a clear idea about the gas content of more normal (albeit massive) galaxies. Here we report the results of a survey of molecular gas in samples of typical massive-star-forming galaxies at mean redshifts $\lt$z$\gt$ of about 1.2 and 2.3, when the Universe was respectively 40\% and 24\% of its current age. Our measurements reveal that distant star forming galaxies were indeed gas rich, and that the star formation efficiency is not strongly dependent on cosmic epoch. The average fraction of cold gas relative to total galaxy baryonic mass at z = 2.3 and z = 1.2 is respectively about 44\% and 34\%, three to ten times higher than in today's massive spiral galaxies. The slow decrease between z\~{}2 and z\~{}1 probably requires a mechanism of semi-continuous replenishment of fresh gas to the young galaxies.},

  abstract = {We present PHIBSS, the IRAM Plateau de Bure high- z blue sequence CO 3-2 survey of the molecular gas properties in massive, main-sequence star-forming galaxies (SFGs) near the cosmic star formation peak. PHIBSS provides 52 CO detections in two redshift slices at z ~ 1.2 and 2.2, with log( M * ( M ☉ )) ≥ 10.4 and log(SFR( M ☉ /yr)) ≥ 1.5. Including a correction for the incomplete coverage of the M * -SFR plane, and adopting a "Galactic" value for the CO-H 2 conversion factor, we infer average gas fractions of ~0.33 at z ~ 1.2 and ~0.47 at z ~ 2.2. Gas fractions drop with stellar mass, in agreement with cosmological simulations including strong star formation feedback. Most of the z ~ 1-3 SFGs are rotationally supported turbulent disks. The sizes of CO and UV/optical emission are comparable. The molecular-gas-star-formation relation for the z = 1-3 SFGs is near-linear, with a ~0.7 Gyr gas depletion timescale; changes in depletion time are only a secondary effect. Since this timescale is much less than the Hubble time in all SFGs between z ~ 0 and 2, fresh gas must be supplied with a fairly high duty cycle over several billion years. At given z and M * , gas fractions correlate strongly with the specific star formation rate (sSFR). The variation of sSFR between z ~ 0 and 3 is mainly controlled by the fraction of baryonic mass that resides in cold gas.},

  abstract  = {The role of disc instabilities, such as bars and spiral arms, and the associated resonances, in growing bulges in the inner regions of disc galaxies have long been studied in the low-redshift nearby Universe. There it has long been probed observationally, in particular through peanut-shaped bulges (Chap.                   14                                  ). This secular growth of bulges in modern disc galaxies is driven by weak, non-axisymmetric instabilities: it mostly produces pseudobulges at slow rates and with long star-formation timescales. Disc instabilities at high redshift (z{\thinspace}>{\thinspace}1) in moderate-mass to massive galaxies (1010 to a few 1011{\thinspace}M⊙ of stars) are very different from those found in modern spiral galaxies. High-redshift discs are globally unstable and fragment into giant clumps containing 108−9{\thinspace}M⊙ of gas and stars each, which results in highly irregular galaxy morphologies. The clumps and other features associated to the violent instability drive disc evolution and bulge growth through various mechanisms on short timescales. The giant clumps can migrate inward and coalesce into the bulge in a few 108 years. The instability in the very turbulent media drives intense gas inflows toward the bulge and nuclear region. Thick discs and supermassive black holes can grow concurrently as a result of the violent instability. This chapter reviews the properties of high-redshift disc instabilities, the evolution of giant clumps and other features associated to the instability, and the resulting growth of bulges and associated sub-galactic components.},

For the first time, we fit two-dimensional models comprising a single Sérsic fit and two-component (i.e., bulge + disk) decompositions not only to the H -band light distributions, but also to the stellar mass maps reconstructed from resolved stellar population modeling. We confirm that the increased bulge prominence among quiescent galaxies, as reported previously based on rest-optical observations, remains in place when considering the distributions of stellar mass. Moreover, we observe an increase of the typical Sérsic index and bulge-to-total ratio (with median B / T reaching 40%-50%) among star-forming galaxies above 10 11 M ☉ . Given that quenching for these most massive systems is likely to be imminent, our findings suggest that significant bulge growth precedes a departure from the star-forming main sequence. We demonstrate that the bulge mass (and ideally knowledge of the bulge and total mass) is a more reliable predictor of the star-forming versus quiescent state of a galaxy than the total stellar mass. The same trends are predicted by the state-of-the-art, semi-analytic model by Somerville et al. In this model, bulges and black holes grow hand in hand through merging and/or disk instabilities, and feedback from active galactic nuclei shuts off star formation. Further observations will be required to pin down star formation quenching mechanisms, but our results imply that they must be internal to the galaxies and closely associated with bulge growth.},

After careful data reduction and stacking analysis, we conduct a radially resolved pixel spectral energy distribution fitting to obtain the radial distributions of the stellar mass and rest-frame colors. The stellar mass of MWs increases in a self-similar way, irrespective of the radial distance, while that of MGs grows in an inside-out way where they obtain ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/805/1/34/apj510634ieqn4.gif] {$\sim 75\%$} of the total mass at the outer ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/805/1/34/apj510634ieqn5.gif] {$\gt 2.5$} kpc) radius since ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/805/1/34/apj510634ieqn6.gif] {$z\sim 2$} . Although the radial mass profiles evolve in distinct ways, the formation and quenching of the central dense region (or bulge) ahead of the formation of the outer disk are found to be common for both systems. The sudden reddening of the bulge at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/805/1/34/apj510634ieqn7.gif] {$z\sim 1.6$} and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/805/1/34/apj510634ieqn8.gif] {$z\sim 2.4$} for MWs and MGs, respectively, suggests the formation of the bulge and would give a clue to the different gas accretion histories and quenching. A new approach to evaluate the morphological diversity is conducted by using the average surface density profile and its dispersion. The variety of the radial mass profiles for MGs peaks at higher redshift ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/805/1/34/apj510634ieqn9.gif] {$z\gt 2.8$} ) and then rapidly converges to a more uniform shape at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/805/1/34/apj510634ieqn10.gif] {$z\lt 1.5$} , while that for MWs remains in the outer region over the redshift. Compared with the observed star-formation rates and color profiles, the evolution of variety is consistently explained by the star-formation activities.},

  abstract = {The increasing abundance of passive "red-sequence" galaxies since z ~ 1-2 is mirrored by a coincident rise in the number of galaxies with spheroidal morphologies. In this paper, however, we show in detail, that, the correspondence between galaxy morphology and color is not perfect, providing insight into the physical origin of this evolution. Using the COSMOS survey, we study a significant population of red-sequence galaxies with disk-like morphologies. These passive disks typically have Sa-Sb morphological types with large bulges, but they are not confined to dense environments. They represent nearly one-half of all red-sequence galaxies and dominate at lower masses ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 10 10 M ☉ ) where they are increasingly disk-dominated. As a function of time, the abundance of passive disks with M * ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 10 11 M ☉ increases, but not as fast as red-sequence spheroidals in the same mass range. At higher mass, the passive disk population has declined since z ~ 1, likely because they transform into spheroidals. Based on these trends, we estimate that as much as 60% of galaxies transitioning onto the red sequence evolve through a passive disk phase. The origin of passive disks therefore has broad implications for our understanding of how star formation shuts down. Because passive disks tend to be more bulge-dominated than their star-forming counterparts, a simple fading of blue disks does not fully explain their origin. We explore the strengths and weaknesses of several more sophisticated explanations, including environmental effects, internal stabilization, and disk regrowth during gas-rich mergers. While previous work has sought to explain color and morphological transformations with a single process, these observations open the way to new insight by highlighting the fact that galaxy evolution may actually proceed through several separate stages.},

In agreement with previous work, their half-light radii are <2 kpc, much smaller than equally massive galaxies in the present-day universe. A significant subset of the sample appears highly flattened in projection, which implies, considering viewing angle statistics, that a significant fraction of the galaxies in our sample have pronounced disks. This is corroborated by two-dimensional surface brightness profile fits. We estimate that 65% ± 15% of the population of massive, quiescent z ~ 2 galaxies are disk dominated. The median disk scale length is 1.5 kpc, substantially smaller than the disks of equally massive galaxies in the present-day universe. Our results provide strong observational evidence that the much-discussed ultra-dense high-redshift galaxies should generally be thought of as disk-like stellar systems with the majority of stars formed from gas that had time to settle into a disk.},

Almost all of these galaxies appear to be relaxed systems, with smooth morphologies at both rest-frame UV and visible wavelengths. Previous results from spectral synthesis modeling favor a single burst of star formation more than 1 Gyr before the observed epoch. The prevalence of old stellar populations, however, does not correlate exclusively with early-type morphologies as it does in the local universe; the light profiles for some of these galaxies appear to be dominated by massive exponential disks. This evidence for massive old disks, along with the apparent uniformity of stellar age across the disk, suggests formation by a mechanism better described as a form of monolithic collapse than as a hierarchical merger. These galaxies could not have undergone a single major merging event since the bulk of their stars were formed, more than 1 Gyr earlier. There is at least one case, however, that appears to be undergoing a "dry merger," which may be an example of the process that converts these unusual galaxies into the familiar spheroids that dominate galaxies comprising old stellar populations at the present epoch.},

  abstract = {Projected axis ratio measurements of 880 early-type galaxies at redshifts 1 < z < 2.5 selected from CANDELS are used to reconstruct and model their intrinsic shapes. The sample is selected on the basis of multiple rest-frame colors to reflect low star-formation activity. We demonstrate that these galaxies as an ensemble are dust-poor and transparent and therefore likely have smooth light profiles, similar to visually classified early-type galaxies. Similar to their present-day counterparts, the z > 1 early-type galaxies show a variety of intrinsic shapes; even at a fixed mass, the projected axis ratio distributions cannot be explained by the random projection of a set of galaxies with very similar intrinsic shapes. However, a two-population model for the intrinsic shapes, consisting of a triaxial, fairly round population, combined with a flat ( c / a ~ 0.3) oblate population, adequately describes the projected axis ratio distributions of both present-day and z > 1 early-type galaxies. We find that the proportion of oblate versus triaxial galaxies depends both on the galaxies' stellar mass, and—at a given mass—on redshift. For present-day and z < 1 early-type galaxies the oblate fraction strongly depends on galaxy mass. At z > 1, this trend is much weaker over the mass range explored here (10 10 < M * / M ☉ < 10 11 ), because the oblate fraction among massive ( M * ~ 10 11 M ☉ ) was much higher in the past: 0.59 ± 0.10 at z > 1, compared to 0.20 ± 0.02 at z ~ 0.1. When combined with previous findings that the number density and sizes of early-type galaxies substantially increase over the same redshift range, this can be explained by the gradual emergence of merger-produced elliptical galaxies, at the expense of the destruction of pre-existing disks that were common among their high-redshift progenitors. In contrast, the oblate fraction among low-mass early-type galaxies (log ( M * / M ☉ ) < 10.5) increased toward the present, from z = 0 to 0.38 ± 0.11 at z > 1 to 0.72 ± 0.06 at z = 0. We speculate that this lower incidence of disks at early cosmic times can be attributed to two factors: low-mass, star-forming progenitors at z > 1 were not settled into stable disks to the same degree as at later cosmic times, and the stripping of gas from star-forming disk galaxies in dense environments is an increasingly important process at lower redshifts.},

Our fast rotating lenticular disk galaxies with bulge magnitudes M V ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} –21.30 mag have central stellar deficits, suggesting that these bulges may have formed from "dry" merger events involving supermassive black holes (BHs) while their surrounding disk was subsequently built up, perhaps via cold gas accretion scenarios. The central stellar mass deficits M def are roughly 0.5-2 M BH (BH mass), rather than ~10-20 M BH as claimed from some past studies, which is in accord with core-Sérsic model mass deficit measurements in elliptical galaxies. Furthermore, these bulges have Sérsic indices n ~3, half-light radii R e 10 11 M ☉ , and therefore appear to be descendants of the compact galaxies reported at z ~ 1.5-2. Past studies which have searched for these local counterparts by using single-component galaxy models to provide the z ~ 0 size comparisons have overlooked these dense, compact, and massive bulges in today's early-type disk galaxies. This evolutionary scenario not only accounts for what are today generally old bulges—which must be present in z ~ 1.5 images—residing in what are generally young disks, but it eliminates the uncomfortable suggestion of a factor of three to five growth in size for the compact, z ~ 1.5 galaxies that are known to possess infant disks.},

  abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present‐day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy—disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters—and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power‐law form for m≳1 M ⊙ and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around m c ∼ 0.08 M ⊙ and a variance in logarithmic mass σ ∼ 0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has m c ∼ 0.2 M ⊙ and σ ∼ 0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L‐ and T‐dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, n BD ∼ n * ∼ 0.1 pc −3 . The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages ≳130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick‐disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, m c ∼ 0.2–0.3 M ⊙ , excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below ∼1 M ⊙ . These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present‐day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations. These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present‐day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass‐to‐light ratio determinations. The mass‐to‐light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8–1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans‐type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super‐Alfvénic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large‐scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.},

  abstract = {The Spitzer Extended Deep Survey (SEDS) is a very deep infrared survey within five well-known extragalactic science fields: the UKIDSS Ultra-Deep Survey, the Extended Chandra Deep Field South, COSMOS, the Hubble Deep Field North, and the Extended Groth Strip. SEDS covers a total area of 1.46 deg 2 to a depth of 26 AB mag (3σ) in both of the warm Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) bands at 3.6 and 4.5 μm. Because of its uniform depth of coverage in so many widely-separated fields, SEDS is subject to roughly 25% smaller errors due to cosmic variance than a single-field survey of the same size. SEDS was designed to detect and characterize galaxies from intermediate to high redshifts ( z = 2-7) with a built-in means of assessing the impact of cosmic variance on the individual fields. Because the full SEDS depth was accumulated in at least three separate visits to each field, typically with six-month intervals between visits, SEDS also furnishes an opportunity to assess the infrared variability of faint objects. This paper describes the SEDS survey design, processing, and publicly-available data products. Deep IRAC counts for the more than 300,000 galaxies detected by SEDS are consistent with models based on known galaxy populations. Discrete IRAC sources contribute 5.6 ± 1.0 and 4.4 ± 0.8 nW m –2 sr –1 at 3.6 and 4.5 μm to the diffuse cosmic infrared background (CIB). IRAC sources cannot contribute more than half of the total CIB flux estimated from DIRBE data. Barring an unexpected error in the DIRBE flux estimates, half the CIB flux must therefore come from a diffuse component.},

We find 24 μm emission for more than 85% of the massive galaxies morphologically classified as disks, and for more than 57% of the massive systems morphologically classified as spheroids at any redshift, with about 8% of sources harboring a bright X-ray- and/or infrared-emitting AGN. More noticeably, ~60% of all compact massive galaxies at z = 1–2 are detected at 24 μm, even when rest-frame optical colors reveal that they are dead and evolving passively. For spheroid-like galaxies at a given stellar mass, the sizes of MIPS nondetections are smaller by a factor of ~1.2 in comparison with IR-bright sources. We find that disklike massive galaxies present specific SFRs ranging from 0.04 to 0.2 Gyr −1 at z < 1 (SFRs ranging from 1 to 10 M ☉ yr −1 ), typically a factor of 3-6 higher than massive spheroid-like objects in the same redshift range. At z > 1, and more pronouncedly at z > 1.3, the median specific SFRs of the disks and spheroids detected by MIPS are very similar, ranging from 0.1 to 1 Gyr −1 ( SFR = 10–200 M ☉ yr −1 ). We estimate that massive spheroid-like galaxies may have doubled (at the most) their stellar mass from star-forming events at z < 2: less than 20% mass increase at 1.7 < z < 2.0, up to 40% more at 1.1 < z < 1.7, and less than 20% additional increase at z < 1. Disklike galaxies may have tripled (at the most) their stellar mass at z < 2 from star formation alone: up to ~40% mass increase at 1.7 < z < 2.0, and less than 180% additional increase below z = 1.7 occurred at a steady rate.},

  abstract = {Several recent studies have shown that about half of the massive galaxies at z ~ 2 are in a quiescent phase. Moreover, these galaxies are commonly found to be ultra-compact with half-light radii of ~1 kpc. We have obtained a ~29 hr spectrum of a typical quiescent, ultra-dense galaxy at z = 2.1865 with the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph. The spectrum exhibits a strong optical break and several absorption features, which have not previously been detected in z > 2 quiescent galaxies. Comparison of the spectral energy distribution with stellar population synthesis models implies a low star formation rate (SFR) of 1-3 M ☉ yr –1 , an age of 1.3-2.2 Gyr, and a stellar mass of ~2 × 10 11 M ☉ . We detect several faint emission lines, with emission-line ratios of[N II ]/Hα, [S II ]/Hα, and[O II]/[O III ] typical of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions. Thus, neither the stellar continuum nor the nebular emission implies active star formation. The current SFR is <1% of the past average SFR. If this galaxy is representative of compact quiescent galaxies beyond z = 2, it implies that quenching of star formation is extremely efficient and also indicates that low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) could be common in these objects. Nuclear emission is a potential concern for the size measurement. However, we show that the AGN contributes ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 8% to the rest-frame optical emission. A possible post-starburst population may affect size measurements more strongly; although a 0.5 Gyr old stellar population can make up ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 10% of the total stellar mass, it could account for up to ~40% of the optical light. Nevertheless, this spectrum shows that this compact galaxy is dominated by an evolved stellar population.},

This is performed using the strength of the Balmer break feature at rest-frame 3648 Å, which is a diagnostic of the age of the stellar population in galaxies. Using the WFC3 H -band-selected catalog for the CANDELS GOODS-S field and deep multi-waveband photometry from optical ( HST ) to mid-infrared ( Spitzer ) wavelengths, we identify a population of old and evolved post-starburst galaxies based on the strength of their Balmer breaks (Balmer break galaxies, BBGs). The galaxies are also selected to be bright in rest-frame near-IR wavelengths and hence massive. We identify a total of 16 BBGs. Fitting the spectral energy distribution of the BBGs shows that the candidate galaxies have average estimated ages of ~800 Myr and average stellar masses of ~5 × 10 10 M ☉ , consistent with being old and massive systems. Two of our BBG candidates are also identified by the criteria that are sensitive to star-forming galaxies (Lyman break galaxy selection). We find a number density of ~3.2 × 10 –5 Mpc –3 for the BBGs, corresponding to a mass density of ~2.0 × 10 6 M ☉ Mpc –3 in the redshift range covering the survey. Given the old age and the passive evolution, it is argued that some of these objects formed the bulk of their mass only a few hundred million years after the big bang.},

The focus of this review is on the broad patterns in the star formation properties of galaxies along the Hubble sequence and their implications for understanding galaxy evolution and the physical processes that drive the evolution. Star formation in the disks and nuclear regions of galaxies are reviewed separately, then discussed within a common interpretive framework. The diagnostic methods used to measure SFRs are also reviewed, and a self-consistent set of SFR calibrations is presented as an aid to workers in the field. },

We combine the infrared data with redshifts, rest-frame luminosities, and colors from COMBO-17 and with morphologies from Hubble Space Telescope images collected by the Galaxy Evolution from Morphology and SEDs (GEMS) and Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) projects. To characterize the decline in star formation rate (SFR) since z ~ 0.7, we estimate the total thermal IR luminosities, SFRs, and stellar masses for the galaxies in this sample. At z ~ 0.7, nearly 40% of intermediate- and high-mass galaxies (with stellar masses ≥2 × 10 10 M ☉ ) are undergoing a period of intense star formation above their past-averaged SFR. In contrast, less than 1% of equally massive galaxies in the local universe have similarly intense star formation activity. Morphologically undisturbed galaxies dominate the total infrared luminosity density and SFR density: at z ~ 0.7, more than half of the intensely star-forming galaxies have spiral morphologies, whereas less than ~30% are strongly interacting. Thus, a decline in major merger rate is not the underlying cause of the rapid decline in cosmic SFR since z ~ 0.7. Physical properties that do not strongly affect galaxy morphology—for example, gas consumption and weak interactions with small satellite galaxies—appear to be responsible.},

  abstract = {The mid-infrared local luminosity function is evolved with redshift to fit the spectrum of the cosmic infrared background (CIRB) at λ > 5 μm and the galaxy counts from various surveys at mid-infrared, far-infrared, and submillimeter wavelengths. A variety of evolutionary models provide satisfactory fits to the CIRB and the number counts. The degeneracy in the range of models cannot be broken by current observations. However, the different evolutionary models yield approximately the same comoving number density of infrared luminous galaxies as a function of redshift. Since the spectrum of the cosmic background at λ > 200 μm is quite sensitive to the evolution at high redshift, i.e., z > 1, all models that fit the counts require a flattening at z ~ 0.8 to avoid overproducing the CIRB. About 80% of the 140 μm CIRB is produced at 0 < z < 1.5, while only about 30% of the 850 μm background is produced within the same redshift range. The nature of the evolution is then translated into a measure of the dust-enshrouded star formation rate (SFR) density as a function of redshift and compared with estimates from rest-frame optical/ultraviolet surveys. The dust-enshrouded SFR density appears to peak at z = 0.8 ± 0.1, much sooner than previously thought, with a value of 0.25 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/556/2/562/img1.gif] {img1.gif} M ☉ yr -1 Mpc -3 , and remains almost constant up to z ~ 2. At least 70% of this star formation takes place in infrared luminous galaxies with L IR > 10 11 L ☉ . The long-wavelength observations that constrain our evolutionary models do not strongly trace the evolution at z > 2 and a drop-off in the dust-enshrouded SFR density is consistent with both the CIRB spectrum and the number counts. However, a comparison with the infrared luminosity function derived from extinction-corrected rest-frame optical/ultraviolet observations of the Lyman break galaxy population at z ~ 3 suggests that the almost flat comoving SFR density seen between redshifts of 0.8 and 2 extends up to a redshift of z ~ 4.},

In a stellar mass bin at 10 10.5 < M galaxy < 10 11 M ☉ , we see no change in the number density of compact Q-ETGs over this redshift range, while in a higher mass bin at >10 11 M ☉ , where we would expect merging to be more significant, we find a small decrease, by ~30%. In both mass bins, the increase of the median sizes of Q-ETGs with time is primarily caused by the addition to the size function of larger and more diffuse Q-ETGs. At all masses, compact Q-ETGs become systematically redder toward later epochs, with a ( U – V ) color difference which is consistent with a passive evolution of their stellar populations, indicating that they are a stable population that does not appreciably evolve in size. We find furthermore, at all epochs, that the larger Q-ETGs (at least in the lower mass bin) have average rest-frame colors that are systematically bluer than those of the more compact Q-ETGs, suggesting that the former are indeed younger than the latter. The idea that new, large, Q-ETGs are responsible for the observed growth in the median size of the population at a given mass is also supported by analysis of the sizes and number of the star-forming galaxies that are expected to be the progenitors of the new Q-ETGs over the same period. In the low mass bin, the new Q-ETGs appear to have ~30% smaller half-light radii than their star-forming progenitors. This is likely due to the fading of their disks after they cease star formation. Comparison with higher redshifts shows that the median size of newly quenched galaxies roughly scales, at constant mass, as (1 + z ) –1 . We conclude that the dominant cause of the size evolution seen in the Q-ETG population is that the average sizes and thus stellar densities of individual Q-ETGs roughly scale with the average density of the universe at the time when they were quenched, and that subsequent size changes in individual objects, through merging or other processes, are of secondary importance, especially at masses below 10 11 M ☉ .},

  abstract = {Morphological and spectroscopic studies of high-redshift clusters indicate that a significant fraction of present-day, early-type galaxies was transformed from star-forming galaxies at z < 1. On the other hand, the slow luminosity evolution of early-type galaxies and the low scatter in their color-magnitude relation indicate a high formation redshift of their stars. In this paper we construct models that reconcile these apparently contradictory lines of evidence, and we quantify the effects of morphological evolution on the observed photometric properties of early-type galaxies in distant clusters. We show that in the case of strong morphological evolution the apparent luminosity and color evolution of early-type galaxies are similar to those of a single-age stellar population formed at z = ∞, irrespective of the true star formation history of the galaxies. Furthermore, the scatter in age, and hence the scatter in color and luminosity, is approximately constant with redshift. These results are consequences of the "progenitor bias": the progenitors of the youngest low-redshift, early-type galaxies drop out of the sample at high redshift. We construct models that reproduce the observed evolution of the number fraction of early-type galaxies in rich clusters and their color and luminosity evolution simultaneously. Our modeling indicates that ~50% of early-type galaxies were transformed from other galaxy types at z < 1, and their progenitor galaxies may have had roughly constant star formation rates prior to morphological transformation. The effect of the progenitor bias on the evolution of the mean M / L ratio and color can be estimated. The progenitor bias is a linear function of the scatter in the color-magnitude relation produced by age variations and is maximal if the observed scatter is entirely due to age differences. After correcting the observed evolution of the mean M / L B ratio for the maximum progenitor bias, we find that the mean luminosity-weighted formation redshift of stars in early-type galaxies ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lang.gif] {lang} z * ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rang.gif] {rang} = 3.0 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/553/1/90/img1.gif] {img1.gif} for Ω m = 0.3 and Ω Λ = 0 and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lang.gif] {lang} z * ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rang.gif] {rang} = 2.0 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/553/1/90/img2.gif] {img2.gif} for Ω m = 0.3 and Ω Λ = 0.7. Our analysis places the star formation epoch of early-type galaxies later than previous studies, which ignored the effects of progenitor bias. The results are consistent with the idea that (some) Lyman break galaxies are star-forming building blocks of massive early-type galaxies in clusters.},

Our sample is almost an order of magnitude larger than previous studies at these redshifts, providing the first statistical study of massive galaxy sizes at z > 2, confirming the extreme compactness of these systems. We split our sample into disk-like ( n ≤ 2) and spheroid-like ( n > 2) galaxies based on their Sérsic indices, and find that at a given stellar mass disk-like galaxies at z ~ 2.3 are a factor of 2.6 ± 0.3 smaller than present-day equal-mass systems, and spheroid-like galaxies at the same redshifts are 4.3 ± 0.7 smaller than comparatively massive elliptical galaxies today. At z > 2 our results are compatible with both a leveling off, or a mild evolution in size. Furthermore, the high density (~2 × 10 10 M ☉ kpc −3 ) of massive galaxies at these redshifts, which are similar to present-day globular clusters, possibly makes any further evolution in sizes beyond z = 3 unlikely.},

Dust and complex morphological structures are common. Dust is detected in 42% of galaxies brighter than B T = 12.15 mag, while kiloparsec-scale stellar disk, bars, and nuclear stellar disks are seen in 60% of galaxies with intermediate luminosity. Isophotal parameters are derived typically within 8 kpc from the center for the brightest galaxies, and 1.5 kpc for the faintest systems, with a resolution of 7 pc. For most galaxies, the surface brightness profiles are well described by a Sérsic model with index n that increases steadily with the galaxy luminosity; only for 8 of the 10 brightest galaxies are the inner profiles (typically within 100 pc of the center) lower than expected based on an extrapolation of the outer Sérsic model, and are better described by a single power-law function. Contrary to previous claims, we find no evidence in support of a strong bimodal behavior of the logarithmic slope of the inner surface brightness profile, γ; in particular the γ distribution for galaxies that do not show evidence of multiple morphological components is unimodal across the entire magnitude range spanned by the ACSVCS galaxies. Although the brightest galaxies have shallow inner profiles, the shallowest profiles are found in faint dwarf systems.

We model the full radial extent of their light profiles by simultaneously fitting a point-spread function (PSF) convolved Sérsic R 1/ n model and, when necessary, either a central point source or a central PSF-convolved Gaussian. Nucleation was detected in all but two of our final sample of 15 dE galaxies. When detected, the luminosities of the central component, L nuc , scale with the host galaxy luminosity L gal such that L nuc = 10 4.76±0.10 ( L gal /10 7 ) 0.87±0.26 . We confirm that the light profiles of the underlying host galaxies display systematic departures from an exponential model that are correlated with the model-independent host galaxy luminosity and are not due to biasing from the nuclear component. The Pearson correlation coefficient between log n and central galaxy surface brightness μ 0 (excluding the flux from extraneous central components) is -0.83 at a significance level of 99.99%. Excluding one outlier, the Pearson correlation coefficient between the logarithm of the Sérsic index n and the host galaxy magnitude is -0.77 at a significance of 99.9%.

The survey consists of 42 orbits of F160W imaging covering ~65 arcmin 2 distributed widely across the sky and reaching a depth of 27.9 AB for a 5σ detection within a 0.2 arcsec radius aperture. Focusing on an optically selected sample of 306 star-forming galaxies with stellar masses in the range M * = 10 9 -10 11 M ☉ , we find that typical circularized effective half-light radii range from ~0.7 to 3.0 kpc and describe a stellar mass-radius relation as early as z ~ 3. While these galaxies are best described by an exponential surface brightness profile (Sérsic index n ~ 1), their distribution of axis ratios is strongly inconsistent with a population of inclined exponential disks and is better reproduced by triaxial stellar systems with minor/major and intermediate/major axis ratios ~0.3 and 0.7, respectively. While rest-UV and rest-optical morphologies are generally similar for a subset of galaxies with HST /Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging data, differences are more pronounced at higher masses M * > 3 × 10 10 M ☉ . Finally, we discuss galaxy morphology in the context of efforts to constrain the merger fraction, finding that morphologically identified mergers/non-mergers generally have insignificant differences in terms of physical observables such as stellar mass and star formation rate, although merger-like galaxies selected according to some criteria have statistically smaller effective radii and correspondingly larger Σ SFR .},

  abstract = {New surface photometry of all known elliptical galaxies in the Virgo cluster is combined with published data to derive composite profiles of brightness, ellipticity, position angle, isophote shape, and color over large radius ranges. These provide enough leverage to show that Sérsic log I ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} r 1/ n functions fit the brightness profiles I ( r ) of nearly all ellipticals remarkably well over large dynamic ranges. Therefore, we can confidently identify departures from these profiles that are diagnostic of galaxy formation. Two kinds of departures are seen at small radii. All 10 of our ellipticals with total absolute magnitudes M VT ≤ –21.66 have cuspy cores—"missing light"—at small radii. Cores are well known and naturally scoured by binary black holes (BHs) formed in dissipationless ("dry") mergers. All 17 ellipticals with –21.54 ≤ M VT ≤ –15.53 do not have cores. We find a new distinct component in these galaxies: all coreless ellipticals in our sample have extra light at the center above the inward extrapolation of the outer Sérsic profile. In large ellipticals, the excess light is spatially resolved and resembles the central components predicted in numerical simulations of mergers of galaxies that contain gas. In the simulations, the gas dissipates, falls toward the center, undergoes a starburst, and builds a compact stellar component that, as in our observations, is distinct from the Sérsic-function main body of the elliptical. But ellipticals with extra light also contain supermassive BHs. We suggest that the starburst has swamped core scouring by binary BHs. That is, we interpret extra light components as a signature of formation in dissipative ("wet") mergers. Besides extra light, we find three new aspects to the ("E-E") dichotomy into two types of elliptical galaxies. Core galaxies are known to be slowly rotating, to have relatively anisotropic velocity distributions, and to have boxy isophotes. We show that they have Sérsic indices n > 4 uncorrelated with M VT . They also are α-element enhanced, implying short star-formation timescales. And their stellar populations have a variety of ages but mostly are very old. Extra light ellipticals generally rotate rapidly, are more isotropic than core Es, and have disky isophotes. We show that they have n ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sime.gif] {sime} 3 ± 1 almost uncorrelated with M VT and younger and less α-enhanced stellar populations. These are new clues to galaxy formation. We suggest that extra light ellipticals got their low Sérsic indices by forming in relatively few binary mergers, whereas giant ellipticals have n > 4 because they formed in larger numbers of mergers of more galaxies at once plus later heating during hierarchical clustering. We confirm that core Es contain X-ray-emitting gas whereas extra light Es generally do not. This leads us to suggest why the E-E dichotomy arose. If energy feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) requires a "working surface" of hot gas, then this is present in core galaxies but absent in extra light galaxies. We suggest that AGN energy feedback is a strong function of galaxy mass: it is weak enough in small Es not to prevent merger starbursts but strong enough in giant Es and their progenitors to make dry mergers dry and to protect old stellar populations from late star formation. Finally, we verify that there is a strong dichotomy between elliptical and spheroidal galaxies. Their properties are consistent with our understanding of their different formation processes: mergers for ellipticals and conversion of late-type galaxies into spheroidals by environmental effects and by energy feedback from supernovae. In an appendix, we develop machinery to get realistic error estimates for Sérsic parameters even when they are strongly coupled. And we discuss photometric dynamic ranges necessary to get robust results from Sérsic fits.},

  abstract    = {We explore the connections between stellar age, chemistry, and kinematics across a Galactocentric distance of $7.5 < R\,(\mathrm{kpc}) < 9.0$, using a sample of $\sim 12\,000$ intermediate-mass (FGK) turnoff stars observed with the RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) survey. The kinematics of this sample are determined using radial velocity measurements from RAVE, and parallax and proper motion measurements from the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS). In addition, ages for RAVE stars are determined using a Bayesian method, taking TGAS parallaxes as a prior. We divide our sample into young ($0 < \tau < 3$ Gyr) and old ($8 < \tau < 13$ Gyr) populations, and then consider different metallicity bins for each of these age groups. We find significant differences in kinematic trends of young and old, metal-poor and metal-rich, stellar populations. In particular, we find a strong metallicity dependence in the mean Galactocentric radial velocity as a function of radius ($\partial {V_{\rm R}}/\partial R$) for young stars, with metal-rich stars having a much steeper gradient than metal-poor stars. For $\partial {V_{\phi}}/\partial R$, young, metal-rich stars significantly lag the LSR with a slightly positive gradient, while metal-poor stars show a negative gradient above the LSR. We interpret these findings as correlations between metallicity and the relative contributions of the non-axisymmetries in the Galactic gravitational potential (the spiral arms and the bar) to perturb stellar orbits.},

  title       = {Tidally induced bars in Illustris galaxies},
  abstract    = {We study barred galaxies selected from the Illustris cosmological simulation, with an emphasis on tidally induced bars formed from flyby interactions. To guarantee high enough resolution we focus on high mass disc galaxies. We find that the fraction of barred galaxies among those (26 per cent at redshift z = 0) is lower in Illustris than observed in the local Universe, and the fraction grows slightly with redshift. The bar fraction also increases with the total stellar mass and decreases with the amount of gas in the disc. Only very few bars at redshift z = 0 are formed in secular evolution and most of them are triggered by external perturbers in mergers or flyby events. We then focus on the effect of flyby interactions on the disc and look at tidally induced bars created by a flyby, or pre-existing bars influenced by the passage of a perturber. In the latter case, the interaction can enhance or weaken the bar. During the interaction, the change in the bar strength occurs right after the pericentre passage. The resulting tidally induced bars tend to be stronger and longer than average. The preferred scenario to create or enhance a bar seems to be with a strong interaction involving a perturber on a prograde orbit. Furthermore, the strength of the created bar grows with the strength of the interaction.},

  abstract    = {We build templates of rotation curves as a function of the $I-$band luminosity via the mass modeling (by the sum of a thin exponential disk and a cored halo profile) of suitably normalized, stacked data from wide samples of local spiral galaxies. We then exploit such templates to determine fundamental stellar and halo properties for a sample of about $550$ local disk-dominated galaxies with high-quality measurements of the optical radius $R_{\rm opt}$ and of the corresponding rotation velocity $V_{\rm opt}$. Specifically, we determine the stellar $M_\star$ and halo $M_{\rm H}$ masses, the halo size $R_{\rm H}$ and velocity scale ${V_{\rm H}}$, and the specific angular momenta of the stellar $j_\star$ and dark matter $j_{\rm H}$ components. We derive global scaling relationships involving such stellar and halo properties both for the individual galaxies in our sample and for their mean within bins; the latter are found to be in pleasing agreement with previous determinations by independent methods (e.g., abundance matching techniques, weak lensing observations, and individual rotation curve modeling). Remarkably, the size of our sample and the robustness of our statistical approach allow us to attain an unprecedented level of precision over an extended range of mass and velocity scales, with $1\sigma$ dispersion around the mean relationships of less than $0.1$ dex. We thus set new standard local relationships that must be reproduced by detailed physical models, that offer a basis for improving the sub-grid recipes in numerical simulations, that provide a benchmark to gauge independent observations and check for systematics, and that constitute a basic step toward the future exploitation of the spiral galaxy population as a cosmological probe.},

  title       = {3D maps of interstellar dust in the Local Arm: using $Gaia$, 2MASS and APOGEE-DR14},
  abstract    = {Gaia data and stellar surveys open the way to the construction of detailed 3D maps of the Galactic interstellar (IS) dust based on the synthesis of star distances and extinctions. Reliable extinction measurements require very accurate photometric calibrations. We show the first step of an iterative process linking 3D dust maps and photometric calibrations and improving them simultaneously. Our previous 3D map of nearby IS dust was used to select low reddening SDSS/APOGEE-DR14 red giants, and this database served for an empirical effective temperature- and metallicity-dependent photometric calibration in the Gaia G and 2MASS Ks bands. This calibration has been combined with Gaia G-band empirical extinction coefficients recently published, G, J and Ks photometry and APOGEE atmospheric parameters to derive the extinction of a large fraction of the survey targets. Distances were estimated independently using isochrones and the magnitude-independent extinction K(J-Ks). This new dataset has been merged with the one used for the earlier version of dust map. A new Bayesian inversion of distance-extinction pairs has been performed to produce an updated 3D map. We present several properties of the new map. Its comparison with 2D dust emission reveals that all large dust shells seen in emission at mid- and high-latitude are closer than 300pc. The updated distribution constrains the well debated, X-ray bright North Polar Spur to originate beyond 800 pc. We use the Orion region to illustrate additional details and distant clouds. On the large scale the map reveals a complex structure of the Local Arm. 2 to 3 kpc-long chains of clouds appear in planes tilted by 15 deg with respect to the Galactic plane. A series of cavities oriented along a l=60-240deg axis crosses the Arm. (http://stilism.obspm.fr)},

  abstract    = {The classification of the host galaxies of the radio sources in the 25 deg$^2$ ultimate XMM extragalactic survey south field (XXL-S) is presented. XXL-S was surveyed at 2.1 GHz with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) and is thus far the largest area radio survey conducted down to rms flux densities of $\sigma \sim 41$ $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. Of the 6287 radio sources in XXL-S, 4758 (75.7%) were cross-matched to an optical counterpart using the likelihood ratio technique. There are 1110 spectroscopic redshifts and 3648 photometric redshifts available for the counterparts, of which 99.4% exist out to $z \sim 4$. A number of multiwavelength diagnostics, including X-ray luminosities, mid-infrared colours, spectral energy distribution fits, radio luminosities, and optical emission lines and colours, were used to classify the sources into three types: low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs), high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs), and star-forming galaxies (SFGs). The final sample contains 1729 LERGs (36.3%), 1159 radio-loud HERGs (24.4%), 296 radio-quiet HERGs (6.2%), 558 SFGs (11.7%), and 1016 unclassified sources (21.4%). The LERGs tend to exist in the most massive galaxies with low star formation rates and redder colours, whereas the HERGs and SFGs exist in galaxies of lower mass, higher star formation rates, and bluer colours. The fraction of blue host galaxies is higher for radio-quiet HERGs than for radio-loud HERGs. LERGs and radio-loud HERGs are found at all radio luminosities, but radio-loud HERGs tend to be more radio luminous than LERGs at a given redshift. These results are consistent with the emerging picture in which LERGs exist in the most massive quiescent galaxies typically found in clusters with hot X-ray halos and HERGs are associated with ongoing star formation in their host galaxies via the accretion of cold gas.},

  abstract    = {The thermal history of the Universe is introduced within the Debye Gravitational Theory (DGT), a thermodynamic theory of induced gravity, and allows to obtain the evolution of systems with the redshift. DGT reproduce the ESO VLT observations, showing falling outer rotation curves for galaxies at redshift above 0.77. A scaling law is observed in the radial acceleration relation (RAR) of galaxies. For accelerations smaller than $\sim 10^{-10}ms^{-1}$ the observed acceleration $g_{obs}$ decreases more slowly than acceleration generated by the baryonic mass $g_{bar}$, following always the relation $g_{obs} \sim \sqrt{g_{bar}}$. The RAR does not care about the specific properties of the galaxy, the relation exists in nearby high-mass elliptical and low-mass spheroidal galaxies. In this paper, through a straightforward analysis, we show that according to DGT, the RAR scaling law observed in nearby galaxies is broken, when are considered distant galaxies. The extreme case happen for galaxies at redshift above 0.77, because according to DGT, the galaxies have declining rotation curves, and the rotation velocity falling faster than the Keplerian-law curve. Then in this case $g_{obs}$ decreases more faster than $g_{bar}$, this means that $g_{obs}$ is systematically lower than $g_{bar}$. We show that DGT prediction for the RAR of galaxies at high redshift is in agreement from those obtained from the falling rotation curves observed by VLT telescope.},

  abstract    = {We study dust attenuation curves of 230,000 individual galaxies in the local universe, ranging from quiescent to intensely star-forming systems, using GALEX, SDSS, and WISE photometry calibrated on Herschel-ATLAS. We use a new method of constraining SED fits with infrared luminosity (SED+LIR fitting), and parameterized attenuation curves determined with the CIGALE SED fitting code. Attenuation curve slopes and UV bump strengths are reasonably well constrained independently from one another. We find that $A_{\lambda}/A_V$ attenuation curves exhibit a very wide range of slopes that are on average as steep as the SMC curve slope. The slope is a strong function of optical opacity. Opaque galaxies have shallower curves - in agreement with recent radiate transfer models. The dependence of slopes on the opacity produces an apparent dependence on stellar mass: more massive galaxies having shallower slopes. Attenuation curves exhibit a wide range of UV bump amplitudes, from none to MW-like; with an average strength 1/3 of the MW bump. Notably, local analogs of high-redshift galaxies have an average curve that is somewhat steeper than the SMC curve, with a modest UV bump that can be to first order ignored, as its effect on the near-UV magnitude is 0.1 mag. Neither the slopes nor the strengths of the UV bump depend on gas-phase metallicity. Functional forms for attenuation laws are presented for normal star-forming galaxies, high-z analogs and quiescent galaxies. We release the catalog of associated SFRs and stellar masses (GSWLC-2).},

We present the GALAH second public data release (GALAH DR2) containing 342,682 stars. For these stars, the GALAH collaboration provides stellar parameters and abundances for up to 23 elements to the community. Here we present the target selection, observation, data reduction and detailed explanation of how the spectra were analysed to estimate stellar parameters and element abundances. For the stellar analysis, we have used a multi-step approach. We use the physics-driven spectrum synthesis of Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME) to derive stellar labels ($T_\mathrm{eff}$, $\log g$, $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$, $\mathrm{[X/Fe]}$, $v_\mathrm{mic}$, $v \sin i$, $A_{K_S}$) for a representative training set of stars. This information is then propagated to the whole survey with the data-driven method of $The~Cannon$. Special care has been exercised in the spectral synthesis to only consider spectral lines that have reliable atomic input data and are little affected by blending lines. Departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) are considered for several key elements, including Li, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, and Fe, using 1D MARCS stellar atmosphere models. Validation tests including repeat observations, Gaia benchmark stars, open and globular clusters, and K2 asteroseismic targets lend confidence in our methods and results. Combining the GALAH DR2 catalogue with the kinematic information from $Gaia$ will enable a wide range of Galactic Archaeology studies, with unprecedented detail, dimensionality, and scope.},

Our emulator is constructed from the AEMULUS simulations, a suite of 40 N-body simulations with snapshots from z=3 to z=0. These simulations cover the flat wCDM parameter space allowed by recent Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation and Type Ia Supernovae results, varying the parameters w, Omega_m, Omega_b, sigma_8, N_{eff}, n_s, and H_0. We validate our emulator using five realizations of seven different cosmologies, for a total of 35 test simulations. These test simulations were not used in constructing the emulator, and were run with fully independent initial conditions. We use our test simulations to characterize the modeling uncertainty of the emulator, and introduce a novel way of marginalizing over the associated systematic uncertainty. We confirm non-universality in our halo mass function emulator as a function of both cosmological parameters and redshift. Our emulator achieves better than 1% precision over much of the relevant parameter space, and we demonstrate that the systematic uncertainty in our emulator will remain a negligible source of error for cluster abundance studies through at least the LSST Year 1 data set.},

  abstract    = {The rapidly growing statistical precision of galaxy surveys has lead to a need for ever-more precise predictions of the observables used to constrain cosmological and galaxy formation models. The primary avenue through which such predictions will be obtained is suites of numerical simulations. These simulations must span the relevant model parameter spaces, be large enough to obtain the precision demanded by upcoming data, and be thoroughly validated in order to ensure accuracy. In this paper we present one such suite of simulations, forming the basis for the AEMULUS Project, a collaboration devoted to precision emulation of galaxy survey observables. We have run a set of 75 (1.05 h^-1 Gpc)^3 simulations with mass resolution and force softening of 3.51\times 10^10 (Omega_m / 0.3) ~ h^-1 M_sun and 20 ~ h^-1 kpc respectively in 47 different wCDM cosmologies spanning the range of parameter space allowed by the combination of recent Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation and Type Ia Supernovae results. We present convergence tests of several observables including spherical overdensity halo mass functions, galaxy projected correlation functions, galaxy clustering in redshift space, and matter and halo correlation functions and power spectra. We show that these statistics are converged to 1% (2%) for halos with more than 500 (200) particles respectively and scales of r>200 ~ h^-1 kpc in real space or k ~ 3 h Mpc^-1 in harmonic space for z\le 1. We find that the dominant source of uncertainty comes from varying the particle loading of the simulations. This leads to large systematic errors for statistics using halos with fewer than 200 particles and scales smaller than k ~ 4 h^-1 Mpc. We provide the halo catalogs and snapshots detailed in this work to the community at https://AemulusProject.github.io.},

We construct our model of galaxy bias using the halo occupation framework, accounting for possible velocity bias. The model includes 15 parameters, including both cosmological and galaxy bias parameters. We demonstrate that our emulator achieves ~ 1% precision at the scales of interest, 0.1<r<10 h^{-1} Mpc, and recovers the true cosmology when tested against independent simulations. Our primary parameters of interest are related to the growth rate of structure, f, and its degenerate combination fsigma_8. Using this emulator, we show that the constraining power on these parameters monotonically increases as smaller scales are included in the analysis, all the way down to 0.1 h^{-1} Mpc. For a BOSS-like survey, the constraints on fsigma_8 from r<30 h^{-1} Mpc scales alone are more than a factor of two tighter than those from the fiducial BOSS analysis of redshift-space clustering using perturbation theory at larger scales. The combination of real- and redshift-space clustering allows us to break the degeneracy between f and sigma_8, yielding a 9% constraint on f alone for a BOSS-like analysis. The current AEMULUS simulations limit this model to surveys of massive galaxies. Future simulations will allow this framework to be extended to all galaxy target types, including emission-line galaxies.},

  abstract = {We present a new model for computing the effects of dust on the integrated spectral properties of galaxies, based on an idealized description of the main features of the interstellar medium (ISM). The model includes the ionization of H II regions in the interiors of the dense clouds in which stars form and the influence of the finite lifetime of these clouds on the absorption of radiation. We compute the production of emission lines and the absorption of continuum radiation in the H II regions and the subsequent transfer of line and continuum radiation in the surrounding H I regions and the ambient ISM. This enables us to interpret simultaneously all the observations of an ultraviolet-selected sample of nearby starburst galaxies, including the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities, the ratio of Hα to Hβ luminosities, the Hα equivalent width, and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We show that the finite lifetime of stellar birth clouds is a key ingredient for resolving an apparent discrepancy between the attenuation of line and continuum photons in starburst galaxies. In addition, we find that an effective absorption curve proportional to λ -0.7 reproduces the observed relation between the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We interpret this relation most simply as a sequence in the overall dust content of the galaxies. The shallow wavelength dependence of the effective absorption curve is compatible with the steepness of known extinction curves if the dust has a patchy distribution. In particular, we find that a random distribution of discrete clouds with optical depths similar to those in the Milky Way provides a consistent interpretation of all the observations. A noteworthy outcome of our detailed analysis is that the observed mean relations for starburst galaxies can be closely approximated by the following simple recipe: use an effective absorption curve proportional to λ -0.7 to attenuate the line and continuum radiation from each stellar generation, and lower the normalization of the curve, typically by a factor of 3 after 10 7 yr, to account for the dispersal of the birth clouds. This recipe or our full model for absorption can be incorporated easily into any population synthesis model.},

  abstract = {We describe a new program for determining photometric redshifts, dubbed EAZY. The program is optimized for cases where spectroscopic redshifts are not available, or are only available for a biased subset of the galaxies. The code combines features from various existing codes: it can fit linear combinations of templates, it includes optional flux- and redshift-based priors, and its user interface is modeled on the popular HYPERZ code. A novel feature is that the default template set, as well as the default functional forms of the priors, are not based on (usually highly biased) spectroscopic samples, but on semianalytical models. Furthermore, template mismatch is addressed by a novel rest-frame template error function. This function gives different wavelength regions different weights, and ensures that the formal redshift uncertainties are realistic. We introduce a redshift quality parameter, Q z , which provides a robust estimate of the reliability of the photometric redshift estimate. Despite the fact that EAZY is not "trained" on spectroscopic samples, the code (with default parameters) performs very well on existing public data sets. For K -selected samples in CDF-South and other deep fields, we find a 1 σ scatter in Δ z/(1 + z) of 0.034, and we provide updated photometric redshift catalogs for the FIRES, MUSYC, and FIREWORKS surveys.},

We utilize aperture-matched multiwavelength data available from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to ensure that regions of comparable size in each galaxy are being analyzed. We follow the method of Calzetti et al. and characterize the dust attenuation through the UV power-law index, β , and the dust optical depth, which is quantified using the difference in Balmer emission line optical depth, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/818/1/13/apj522358ieqn1.gif] {${\tau }_{B}^{l}={\tau }_{{\rm{H}}\beta }-{\tau }_{{\rm{H}}\alpha }$} . The observed linear relationship between β and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/818/1/13/apj522358ieqn2.gif] {${\tau }_{B}^{l}$} is similar to the local starburst relation, but the large scatter ( σ int = 0.44) suggests that there is significant variation in the local universe. We derive a selective attenuation curve over the range 1250Å < λ < 8320 Å and find that a single attenuation curve is effective for characterizing the majority of galaxies in our sample. This curve has a slightly lower selective attenuation in the UV compared to previously determined curves. We do not see evidence to suggest that a 2175 Å feature is significant in the average attenuation curve. Significant positive correlations are seen between the amount of UV and optical reddening and galaxy metallicity, mass, star formation rate (SFR), and SFR surface density. This provides a potential tool for gauging attenuation where the stellar population is unresolved, such as athigh z .},

We show that star-forming galaxies at high redshift ( z > 1.5) are consistent with a model in which the interstellar medium conditions are more extreme at high redshift than seen in the global spectra of local galaxies. We speculate that global spectra of our high-redshift galaxies may be dominated by H II regions similar to the extreme clumpy, dense star-forming complexes in the Antennae and M82. The transition to local-type conditions occurs between 0.8 < z < 1.5. We conclude that classification schemes developed for local samples should not be applied at high redshift ( z ≥ 1.5). We use our theoretical models to derive a new redshift-dependent classification line that utilizes the standard optical diagnostic line ratios [O III ]/Hβ and [N II ]/Hα. Our new line can be used to separate star-forming galaxies from active galactic nuclei (AGN) between z = 0 to z ~ 3.5. We anticipate that our redshift-dependent optical classification line will be useful for future large surveys with near-infrared multi-object spectrographs. We apply our classification line to a sample of gravitationally lensed galaxies at z ~ 2.5. Although limited by small numbers, we show that our classification line is consistent with the position of AGN that have been independently confirmed via other methods.},

The oxygen abundance in these galaxies is very low, varying in the range 12 + log O/H = 7.36–7.99. Such extraordinarily high broad Hα luminosities cannot be accounted for by massive stars at different stages of their evolution. By comparing these with the first-epoch SDSS spectra, we find that the broad Hα luminosities have remained constant over a period of 3-7 yr, which probably excludes Type IIn supernovae as a possible mechanism of broad emission. The emission most likely comes from accretion disks around intermediate-mass black holes, with lower mass limits in the range ~ 5 × 10 5 - 3 × 10 6 M ☉ . If this is the case, these four objects form a new class of very low metallicity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that have been elusive until now. The absence of the strong high-ionization lines [Ne V] λ3426 and He II λ4686 can be understood if the nonthermal radiation contributes less than ~10% of the total ionizing radiation.},

While on-sequence galaxies follow continuous star formation processes, EELGs are thought to be caught during an extreme burst of star formation that can double their stellar mass in a period of less than 100 Myr. The contribution of the starburst population to the total star formation density appears to be larger than what has been reported for more massive galaxies in previous studies. In the complete mass range 8.2 < log( M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sstarf.gif] {sstarf} / M ☉ ) <10 and a SFR lower completeness limit of about 2 M ☉ yr –1 (10 M ☉ yr –1 ) at z ~ 1 ( z ~ 2), we find that starbursts having EW rest (Hα) > 300, 200, and 100 Å contribute up to ~13%, 18%, and 34%, respectively, to the total SFR of emission-line-selected sample at z ~ 1-2.

Recent advances in evolutionary synthesis models have given new breath to this old field of research. Modern spectral synthesis techniques incorporating these advances now allow the fitting of galaxy spectra on an {\AA}-by-{\AA}. These detailed fits are useful for a number of studies, like emission line, stellar kinematics, and specially galaxy evolution. Applications of this semi-empirical approach to mega data sets are teaching us a lot about the lives of galaxies. The STARLIGHT spectral synthesis code is one of the tools which allows one to harness this favorable combination of plentifulness of data and models. To illustrate this, we show how SFHs vary across classical emission line diagnostic diagrams. Systematic trends are present along both the star-forming and active-galaxy sequences. We also briefly describe experiments with new versions of evolutionary synthesis models. Last but not least, we announce the public availability of both STARLIGHT and a database of detailed spectral fits and related products for over half a million galaxies from the SDSS. This facility allows more physically inspired explorations of the parameter space than is possible in terms of raw observed properties, offering new ways to navigate through the realm of galaxies.},

They can efficiently drive gas into the central kiloparsec of galaxies, thus feed circumnuclear starbursts, and possibly help to fuel AGN. The connection between bars and AGN activities has been actively debated in the past two decades. Previous work used fairly small samples and often lacked a proper control sample. They reported conflicting results on the correlation between bars and AGN activity. Here we revisit the bar-AGN and bar-starburst connections using the analysis of bars in a large sample of about 2000 SDSS disk galaxies (Barazza, Jogee, {\amp} Marinova 2008). We find that AGN and star-forming galaxies have similar optical bar fractions, 47\% and 50\%, respectively. Both bar fractions are higher than that in inactive galaxies (29\%). We discuss the implications of the study on the relationship between host galaxies and their central activities.},

We measure reddening as the difference between the measured and predicted colors of a star, as derived from stellar parameters from the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration Stellar Parameter Pipeline. We achieve uncertainties of 56, 34, 25, and 29 mmag in the colors u – g , g – r , r – i , and i – z , per star, though the uncertainty varies depending on the stellar type and the magnitude of the star. The spectrum-based reddening measurements confirm our earlier "blue tip" reddening measurements, finding reddening coefficients different by –3%, 1%, 1%, and 2% in u – g , g – r , r – i , and i – z from those found by the blue tip method, after removing a 4% normalization difference. These results prefer an R V = 3.1 Fitzpatrick reddening law to O'Donnell or Cardelli et al. reddening laws. We provide a table of conversion coefficients from the Schlegel et al. (SFD) maps of E ( B – V ) to extinction in 88 bandpasses for four values of R V , using this reddening law and the 14% recalibration of SFD first reported by Schlafly et al. and confirmed in this work.},

  abstract = {We have carried out a survey of the north and south ecliptic poles, EP-N and EP-S, respectively, with the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer ( WISE ). The primary objective was to cross-calibrate WISE with the Spitzer and Midcourse Space Experiment ( MSX ) photometric systems by developing a set of calibration stars that are common to these infrared missions. The ecliptic poles were continuous viewing zones for WISE due to its polar-crossing orbit, making these areas ideal for both absolute and internal calibrations. The Spitzer IRAC and MIPS imaging survey covers a complete area of 0.40 deg 2 for the EP-N and 1.28 deg 2 for the EP-S. WISE observed the whole sky in four mid-infrared bands, 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 μm, during its eight-month cryogenic mission, including several hundred ecliptic polar passages; here we report on the highest coverage depths achieved by WISE , an area of ~1.5 deg 2 for both poles. Located close to the center of the EP-N, the Sy-2 galaxy NGC 6552 conveniently functions as a standard calibrator to measure the red response of the 22 μm channel of WISE . Observations from Spitzer -IRAC/MIPS/IRS-LL and WISE show that the galaxy has a strong red color in the mid-infrared due to star-formation and the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), while over a baseline >1 year the mid-IR photometry of NGC 6552 is shown to vary at a level less than 2%. Combining NGC 6552 with the standard calibrator stars, the achieved photometric accuracy of the WISE calibration, relative to the Spitzer and MSX systems, is 2.4%, 2.8%, 4.5%, and 5.7% for W1 (3.4 μm), W2 (4.6 μm), W3 (12 μm), and W4 (22 μm), respectively. The WISE photometry is internally stable to better than 0.1% over the cryogenic lifetime of the mission. The secondary objective of the Spitzer - WISE Survey was to explore the poles at greater flux-level depths, exploiting the higher angular resolution Spitzer observations and the exceptionally deep (in total coverage) WISE observations that potentially reach down to the confusion limit of the survey. The rich Spitzer and WISE data sets were used to study the Galactic and extragalactic populations through source counts, color-magnitude and color-color diagrams. As an example of what the data sets facilitate, we have separated stars from galaxies, delineated normal galaxies from power-law-dominated AGNs, and reported on the different fractions of extragalactic populations. In the EP-N, we find an AGN source density of ~260 deg –2 to a 12 μm depth of 115 μJy, representing 15% of the total extragalactic population to this depth, similar to what has been observed for low-luminosity AGNs in other fields.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the issue of how best to correct astronomical data for the wavelength‐dependent effects of Galactic interstellar extinction. The main general features of extinction from the IR through the UV are reviewed, along with the nature of observed spatial variations. The enormous range of extinction properties found in the Galaxy, particularly in the UV spectral region, is illustrated. Fortunately, there are some tight constraints on the wavelength dependence of extinction and some general correlations between extinction curve shape and interstellar environment. These relationships provide some guidance for correcting data for the effects of extinction. Several strategies for dereddening are discussed along with estimates of the uncertainties inherent in each method. In the Appendix, a new derivation of the wavelength dependence of an average Galactic extinction curve from the IR through the UV is presented, along with a new estimate of how this extinction law varies with the parameter R≡A(V)/ E ( B − V ). These curves represent the true monochromatic wavelength dependence of extinction and, as such, are suitable for dereddening IR–UV spectrophotometric data of any resolution and can be used to derive extinction relations for any photometry system.},

We report the discovery of the closest companion observed so far in sub-mm observations of high-z QSOs, distant only 2.2 kpc and merging with J1015+0020, while two other [CII] emitters are found at 8 and 17 kpc. Two strong continuum emitters are also detected at <3.5 arcsec. They are likely associated to the same overdense structure of J1015+0020, as they exceed by a factor of 100 the number of expected sources, considering the Log(N)-Log(S) at 850 um. The host galaxy of J1015+0020 shows a SFR of about 100 Msun/yr while the total SFR of the QSO and its companion galaxies is a factor of 10 higher, indicating that substantial stellar mass assembly at early epochs may have taken place in the QSO satellites. For J1015+0020 we compute a SMBH mass MBH~6E9 Msun and a dynamical mass Mdyn~4E10 Msun . This translates into an extreme ratio Mdyn/MBH~7. The total stellar mass of the QSO host galaxy plus the [CII] emitters already exceeds 1E11 Msun at z~4.4. They will likely merge and develop into a giant galaxy of 1.3E12 Msun. By comparing the black hole accretion rate and the SFR, and assuming that local relations between the mass outflow rate and the QSO bolometric luminosity hold at the observed redshift, we conclude that J1015+0020 is potentially able to drive a massive molecular outflow affecting the SFR in the QSO host galaxy, similarly to what observed for 47 QSOs at z>4.5. Under the assumption of constant mass or Eddington accretion rate equal to the observed ones, we find that the growth timescale of the host galaxy is comparable or even shorter than the one inferred for the SMBH.},

  abstract    = {Distances and extinction values are usually degenerate. To refine the distance to the general Galactic Center region, a carefully determined extinction law (taking into account the prevailing systematic errors) is urgently needed. We collected data for 55 classical Cepheids projected toward the Galactic Center region to derive the near- to mid-infrared extinction law using three different approaches. The relative extinction values obtained are AJ/AKs = 3.005, AH/AKs = 1.717, A[3.6]/AKs = 0.478, A[4.5]/AKs = 0.341, A[5.8]/AKs = 0.234, A[8.0]/AKs = 0.321, AW1/AKs = 0.506, and AW2/AKs = 0.340. We also calculated the corresponding systematic errors. Compared with previous work, we report an extremely low and steep mid-infrared extinction law. Using a seven-passband 'optimal distance' method, we improve the mean distance precision to our sample of 55 Cepheids to 4%. Based on four confirmed Galactic Center Cepheids, a solar Galactocentric distance of R_0 = 8.10\pm0.19\pm0.22 kpc is determined, featuring an uncertainty that is close to the limiting distance accuracy (2.8%) for Galactic Center Cepheids.},

Using the superb capabilities of the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer on the Very Large Telescope, high-quality integral-field spectroscopic data were obtained for the inner regions of all the bright ($m_B\leq15$) galaxies within the virial radius of Fornax. The stellar haloes of early-type galaxies are also covered out to about four effective radii. State-of-the-art stellar dynamical and population modelling allows to aim in particular at better characterising the disc components of fast-rotating early-type galaxies, constraining radial variations in the stellar initial-mass functions and measuring the stellar age, metallicity, and $\alpha$-element abundance of stellar haloes in cluster galaxies. This paper describes the sample selection, observations, and overall goals of the survey, and provides initial results based on the spectroscopic data, including the detailed characterisation of stellar kinematics and populations to large radii; decomposition of galaxy components directly via their orbital structure; the ability to identify globular clusters and planetary nebulae, and derivation of high-quality emission-line diagnostics in the presence of complex ionised gas.},

  title       = {NIHAO XVI: The properties and evolution of kinematically selected discs, bulges and stellar haloes},
  abstract    = {We use 25 simulated galaxies from the NIHAO project to define and characterize a variety of kinematic stellar structures: thin and thick discs, large scale single discs, classical and pseudo bulges, spheroids, inner discs, and stellar haloes. These structures have masses, spins, shapes and rotational support in good agreement with theoretical expectations and observational data. Above a dark matter halo mass of $2.5\times10^{\rm~11}M_{\rm\odot}$, all galaxies have a classical bulge and 70\% have a thin and thick disc. The kinematic (thin) discs follow a power-law relation between azimuthal angular momentum and stellar mass $J_z\sim~M_{\rm~*}^{\rm1.25\pm0.06}$, with an exponent slightly smaller that the theoretically predicted value of $5/3$, and show a strong correlation between maximum `observed' rotation velocity and dark matter halo circular velocity. Tracing back in time these structures' progenitors, we find all to lose a fraction $1-f_j$ of their maximum angular momentum.

  title       = {Introducing galactic structure finder: the multiple stellar kinematic structures of a simulated Milky Way mass galaxy},
  abstract    = {We present the first results of applying Gaussian Mixture Models in the stellar kinematic space of normalized angular momentum and binding energy on NIHAO high resolution galaxies to separate the stars into multiple components. We exemplify this method using a simulated Milky Way analogue, whose stellar component hosts: thin and thick discs, classical and pseudo bulges, and a stellar halo. The properties of these stellar structures are in good agreement with observational expectations in terms of sizes, shapes and rotational support. Interestingly, the two kinematic discs show surface mass density profiles more centrally concentrated than exponentials, while the bulges and the stellar halo are purely exponential. We trace back in time the Lagrangian mass of each component separately to study their formation history. Between z~3 and the end of halo virialization, z~1.3, all components lose a fraction of their angular momentum. The classical bulge loses the most (~95%) and the thin disc the least (~60%). Both bulges formed their stars in-situ at high redshift, while the thin disc formed ~98% in-situ, but with a constant SFR~1.5M$_{\rm\odot}$/yr$^{\rm-1}$ over the last ~11 Gyr. Accreted stars (6% of total stellar mass) are mainly incorporated to the thick disc or the stellar halo, which formed ex-situ 8% and 45% of their respective masses.

  __markedentry = {[ling:4]},
  abstract      = {Galaxy clusters at high redshifts are key targets for understanding matter assembly in the early Universe, yet they are challenging to locate. A sample of >2000 high-z candidate structures have been found using Planck's all-sky submm maps, and a subset of 234 have been followed up with Herschel-SPIRE, which showed that the emission can be attributed to large overdensities of dusty star-forming (SF) galaxies. However, the individual galaxies have not yet been resolved nor characterized, so we do not know whether they constitute the progenitors of present-day, massive galaxy clusters. We targeted the 8 brightest SPIRE sources in the centre of the Planck peak G073.4-57.5 using ALMA at 1.3mm, and complemented these observations with data from IRAC, WIRCam J,K, and SCUBA-2. We detect a total of 18 millimetre galaxies brighter than 0.3mJy in 2.4arcmin^2. The ALMA source density is 8-30 times higher than average background estimates, and larger than seen in typical "proto-cluster" fields. We are able to match all but one ALMA sources to their NIR counterparts. The most significant (four) SCUBA-2 sources are not included in the ALMA pointings, but we find an 8sigma stacking detection of the ALMA sources in the SCUBA-2 map at 850um. We derive photo-z, L_IR, SFR, M_*, T_dust, and M_dust for all the ALMA galaxies; the photo-zs are concentrated around z=1.5 and the near-IR colours show a "red" sequence, while the SFRs indicate that one third of the galaxies are "starbursts," the others being main-sequence (MS) SF galaxies. Serendipitous CO line detections of two of the galaxies appear to match their photo-zs, with z = 1.54. We thus find that the Planck peak G073.4-57.5 contains a proto-cluster candidate at z=1.54, and one of the richest regions of ALMA sources known. The ALMA-detected members are massive galaxies on the MS relation and account for a total SFR of at least 1000MSun/yr.},

  title       = {Molecular gas masses of gamma-ray burst host galaxies},
  abstract    = {The objectives of this paper are to analyse molecular gas properties of the first substantial sample of GRB hosts and test whether they are deficient in molecular gas. We obtained CO(2-1) observations of seven GRB hosts with the APEX and IRAM30m telescopes. We analyse these data together with all other hosts with previous CO observations. We obtained detections for three GRB hosts (980425, 080207 and 111005A) and upper limits for the remaining four (031203, 060505, 060814, 100316D). In our entire sample of twelve CO-observed GRB hosts, three are clearly deficient in molecular gas, even taking into account their metallicity (980425, 060814, and 080517). Four others are close to the best fit-line for other star-forming galaxies on the SFR-MH2 plot (051022, 060505, 080207, and 100316D). One host is clearly molecule-rich (111005A). Finally, for four GRB hosts the data is not deep enough to judge whether they are molecule-deficient (000418, 030329, 031203, 090423). The median value of the molecular gas depletion time, MH2/SFR, of GRB hosts is ~0.3 dex below that of other star-forming galaxies, but this result has low statistical significance. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test performed on MH2/SFR shows only ~2 sigma difference between GRB hosts and other galaxies. This difference can partially be explained by metallicity effects, since the significance decreases to ~1 sigma for MH2/SFR vs. metallicity. Thus the sample of GRB hosts has consistent molecular properties to other galaxies, and can be treated as representative star-forming galaxies. Given the concentration of atomic gas recently found close to GRB and supernova sites, indicating recent gas inflow, our results imply that such inflow does not enhance the SFRs significantly, or that atomic gas converts efficiently into the molecular phase.},

  abstract    = {We use a new panoramic imaging survey, conducted with the Dark Energy Camera, to map the stellar fringes of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds to extremely low surface brightness V $\gtrsim$ 32 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. Our results starkly illustrate the closely interacting nature of the LMC-SMC pair. We show that the outer LMC disk is strongly distorted, exhibiting an irregular shape, evidence for warping, and significant truncation on the side facing the SMC. Large diffuse stellar substructures are present both to the north and south of the LMC, and in the inter-Cloud region. At least one of these features appears co-spatial with the bridge of RR Lyrae stars that connects the Clouds. The SMC is highly disturbed -- we confirm the presence of tidal tails, as well as a large line-of-sight depth on the side closest to the LMC. Young, intermediate-age, and ancient stellar populations in the SMC exhibit strikingly different spatial distributions. In particular, those with ages $\sim$ 1.5-4 Gyr exhibit a spheroidal distribution with a centroid offset from that of the oldest stars by several degrees towards the LMC. We speculate that the gravitational influence of the LMC may already have been perturbing the gaseous component of the SMC several Gyr ago. With careful modeling, the variety of substructures and tidal distortions evident in the Magellanic periphery should tightly constrain the interaction history of the Clouds.},

  title       = {Snake in the Clouds: A new nearby dwarf galaxy in the Magellanic bridge},
  abstract    = {We report the discovery of a nearby dwarf galaxy in the constellation of Hydrus, between the Large and the Small Magellanic Clouds. Hydrus 1 is a mildy elliptical ultra-faint system with luminosity $M_V\sim$ -4.7 and size $\sim$ 50 pc, located 28 kpc from the Sun and 24 kpc from the LMC. From spectroscopy of $\sim$ 30 member stars, we measure a velocity dispersion of 2.7 km/s and find tentative evidence for a radial velocity gradient consistent with 3 km/s rotation. Hydrus 1's velocity dispersion indicates that the system is dark matter dominated, but its dynamical mass-to-light ratio M/L $\sim$ 66 is significantly smaller than typical for ultra-faint dwarfs at similar luminosity. The kinematics and spatial position of Hydrus~1 make it a very plausible member of the family of satellites brought into the Milky Way by the Magellanic Clouds. While Hydrus 1's proximity and well-measured kinematics make it a promising target for dark matter annihilation searches, we find no evidence for significant gamma-ray emission from Hydrus 1. The new dwarf is a metal-poor galaxy with a mean metallicity [Fe/H]=-2.5 and [Fe/H] spread of 0.4 dex, similar to other systems of similar luminosity. Alpha-abundances of Hyi 1 members indicate that star-formation was extended, lasting between 0.1 and 1 Gyr, with self-enrichment dominated by SN Ia. The dwarf also hosts a highly carbon-enhanced extremely metal-poor star with [Fe/H] $\sim$ -3.2 and [C/Fe] $\sim$ +3.0.},

Compared to expectations from abundance matching models, the dark matter mass contained in NGC1052-DF2 is smaller by a factor of $\sim 400$. We utilize controlled $N$-body simulations of the tidal interaction between NGC1052 and a smaller satellite galaxy, that we suppose as the progenitor of NGC1052-DF2, to test if tidal stripping can explain dark-matter deficiency at such levels. We find that when assuming a tightly bound orbit as well as a relatively low concentration and cored density profile for the dark halo of the satellite, our simulations reproduce well both the mass profile and the effective radius inferred from the observations of NGC1052-DF2. Orbital parameters and halo concentration are in the tail, but still consistent with measurements of their distributions from cosmological simulations. Such strongly dark-matter deficient galaxies, in our scenario, are thus expected to be relatively rare in groups and clusters, and not present in the field.},

  abstract    = {The star formation (SFH) and chemical enrichment (CEH) histories of Local Group galaxies are traditionally studied by analyzing their resolved stellar populations in a form of color-magnitude diagrams obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. Star clusters can be studied in integrated light using ground-based telescopes to much larger distances. They represent snapshots of chemical evolution of their host galaxy at different ages. Here we present a simple theoretical framework for the chemical evolution based on the instantaneous recycling approximation (IRA) model. We infer a CEH from a SFH and vice versa using observational data. We also present a more advanced model for the evolution of individual chemical elements which takes into account the contribution of supernovae type Ia. We demonstrate that ages, iron and $\alpha$-element abundances of 15 star clusters derived from fitting of their integrated optical spectra reliably trace the CEH of the Large Magellanic Cloud obtained from resolved stellar populations in the age range 40Myr$<t<$3.5Gyr. The CEH predicted by our model from the global SFH of the LMC agrees remarkably well with the observed cluster age-metallicity relation. Moreover, the present day total gas mass of the LMC estimated by the IRA model ($6.2\cdot10^8 M_{\odot}$) matches within uncertainties the observed HI mass corrected for the presence of molecular gas ($5.8\pm0.5\cdot10^8 M_{\odot}$). We briefly discuss how our approach can be used to study SFHs of galaxies as distant as 10Mpc at the level of detail that is currently available only in a handful of nearby Milky Way satellites.},

We use the full set of 5 Chandra observations taken of A115 to date (360 ks total integration) to construct high-fidelity temperature and surface brightness maps. We also examine radio data from the Very Large Array at 1.5 GHz and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope at 0.6 GHz. We propose that the high X-ray spectral temperature between the subclusters results from the interaction of the bow shocks driven into the intracluster medium by the motion of the subclusters relative to one another. We have identified morphologically similar scenarios in Enzo numerical N-body/hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy clusters in a cosmological context. In addition, the giant radio relic feature in A115, with an arc-like structure and a relatively flat spectral index, is likely consistent with other shock-associated giant radio relics seen in other massive galaxy clusters. We suggest a dynamical scenario that is consistent with the structure of the X-ray gas, the hot region between the clusters, and the radio relic feature.},

  abstract     = {We present a comparison of two samples of z>0.8 galaxy clusters selected using different wavelength-dependent techniques and examine the physical differences between them. We consider 18 clusters from the X-ray selected XMM-LSS distant cluster survey and 92 clusters from the optical-MIR selected SpARCS cluster survey. Both samples are selected from the same approximately 9 square degree sky area and we examine them using common XMM-Newton, Spitzer-SWIRE and CFHT Legacy Survey data. Clusters from each sample are compared employing aperture measures of X-ray and MIR emission. We divide the SpARCS distant cluster sample into three sub-samples: a) X-ray bright, b) X-ray faint, MIR bright, and c) X-ray faint, MIR faint clusters. We determine that X-ray and MIR selected clusters display very similar surface brightness distributions of galaxy MIR light. In addition, the average location and amplitude of the galaxy red sequence as measured from stacked colour histograms is very similar in the X-ray and MIR-selected samples. The sub-sample of X-ray faint, MIR bright clusters displays a distribution of BCG-barycentre position offsets which extends to higher values than all other samples. This observation indicates that such clusters may exist in a more disturbed state compared to the majority of the distant cluster population sampled by XMM-LSS and SpARCS. This conclusion is supported by stacked X-ray images for the X-ray faint, MIR bright cluster sub-sample that display weak, centrally-concentrated X-ray emission, consistent with a population of growing clusters accreting from an extended envelope of material.},

  abstract    = {After the tidal disruption of a star by a massive black hole, disrupted stellar debris can fall back to the hole at a rate significantly exceeding its Eddington limit. To understand how black hole mass affects the duration of super-Eddington accretion in tidal disruption events, we first run a suite of simulations of the disruption of a Solar-like star by a supermassive black hole of varying mass to directly measure the fallback rate onto the hole, and we compare these fallback rates to the analytic predictions of the "frozen-in" model. Then, adopting a Zero-Bernoulli Accretion flow as an analytic prescription for the accretion flow around the hole, we investigate how the accretion rate onto the black hole evolves with the more accurate fallback rates calculated from the simulations. We find that numerically-simulated fallback rates yield accretion rates onto the hole that can, depending on the black hole mass, be nearly an order of magnitude larger than those predicted by the frozen-in approximation. Our results place new limits on the maximum black hole mass for which super-Eddington accretion occurs in tidal disruption events.},

Six are securely identified, two have probable identifications, and four remain unidentified with I AB > 25. Spectroscopic and estimated photometric redshifts indicate that four of the sources have z < 1 and four have 1 3. The spectral energy distributions of the identifications, as defined by measurements or upper limits to the flux densities at 8000 Å, at 15, 450, 850 μm, and at 6 cm, are consistent with the spectral energy distributions of high-extinction starbursts such as Arp 220. The far-IR luminosities of the sources at z > 0.5 are of order 3 × 10 12 h -2 50 L ☉ , i.e., slightly larger than that of Arp 220. As with local ultraluminous infrared galaxies, the optical luminosities of the identified galaxies are comparable to present-day L* , and the optical morphologies of many of the galaxies show evidence for mergers or highly disruptive interactions. Based on this small sample, the cumulative bolometric luminosity function shows strong evolution to z ~1, but weaker or possibly even negative evolution beyond. The redshift dependence of the far-IR luminosity density does not appear, at this early stage, to be inconsistent with that seen in the ultraviolet luminosity density. Although the computation of bolometric luminosities is quite uncertain, the population of very luminous galaxies that is detected in the surveys at z > 1 is already matching, in the far-IR, the bolometric output in the ultraviolet of the whole optically selected population. Assuming that the energy source in the far-IR is massive stars, this suggests that the total luminous output from star formation in the universe will be dominated by the far-IR emission once the lower luminosity sources, below the current far-IR detection threshold, are included. Furthermore, the detected systems have individual star formation rates (exceeding 300 h -2 50 M ☉ yr -1 ) that are much higher than seen in the ultraviolet-selected samples and that are sufficient to form substantial stellar populations on dynamical timescales of 10 8 yr. The association with mergerlike morphologies and the obvious presence of dust makes it attractive to identify these systems as forming the metal-rich spheroid population, in which case we would infer that much of this activity has occurred relatively recently, at z ~2.},

  abstract      = {Massive clusters of galaxies have been found that date from as early as 3.9 billion years (3.9Gyr z = 1.62) after the Big Bang, containing stars that formed at even earlier epochs. Cosmological simulations using the current cold dark matter model predict that these systems should descend from `protoclusters'-early overdensities of massive galaxies that merge hierarchically to form a cluster. These protocluster regions themselves are built up hierarchically and so are expected to contain extremely massive galaxies that can be observed as luminous quasars and starbursts. Observational evidence for this picture, however, is sparse because high-redshift protoclusters are rare and difficult to observe. Here we report a protocluster region that dates from 1Gyr (z = 5.3) after the Big Bang. This cluster of massive galaxies extends over more than 13 megaparsecs and contains a luminous quasar as well as a system rich in molecular gas. These massive galaxies place a lower limit of more than 4{\times}10$^{11}$ solar masses of dark and luminous matter in this region, consistent with that expected from cosmological simulations for the earliest galaxy clusters.},

We find 68 Hα emitters with dust-uncorrected star formation rates (SFRs) down to 8.6 M ☉ yr –1 . Their spatial distribution indicates that there are three prominent clumps of Hα emitters: one surrounding the radio galaxy, the second located at ~1.5 Mpc away to the southwest, and the third located between the two. These contiguous three systems are very likely to merge together in the near future and may grow to a single more massive cluster at a later time. While most Hα emitters reside in the "blue cloud" on the color-magnitude diagram, some emitters have very red colors with J – K s > 1.38(AB). Interestingly, such red Hα emitters are located toward the faint end of the red sequence, and they tend to be located in high density clumps. We do not see any statistically significant difference in the distributions of individual SFRs or stellar masses of the Hα emitters between the dense clumps and the other regions, suggesting that this is one of the notable sites where the progenitors of massive galaxies in the present-day clusters were in their vigorous formation phase. Finally, we find that Hα emission of the radio galaxy is fairly extended spatially over ~4 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/farcs.gif] {farcs} 5. However, it is not as widespread as its Lyα halo, meaning that the Lyα emission is indeed severely extended by resonant scattering.},

This review describes the current status of this field and highlights promising recent findings related to galaxy formation in the densest regions of the early universe. We discuss the main search techniques and the characteristic properties of protoclusters in observations and simulations, and show that protoclusters will have present-day masses similar to galaxy clusters when fully collapsed. We discuss the physical properties of galaxies in protoclusters, including (proto-)brightest cluster galaxies, and the forming red sequence. We highlight the fact that the most massive halos at high redshift are found in protoclusters, making these objects uniquely suited for testing important recent models of galaxy formation. We show that galaxies in protoclusters should be among the first galaxies at high redshift making the transition from a gas cooling regime dominated by cold streams to a regime dominated by hot intracluster gas, which could be tested observationally. We also discuss the possible connections between protoclusters and radio galaxies, quasars, and Ly{$\alpha$} blobs. Because of their early formation, large spatial sizes and high total star-formation rates, protoclusters have also likely played a crucial role during the epoch of reionization, which can be tested with future experiments that will map the neutral and ionized cosmic web. Lastly, we review a number of promising observational projects that are expected to make significant impact in this growing, exciting field.},

The phase-space diagram showing relative velocity versus cluster-centric distance indicates that the gas-rich galaxies have entered the cluster more recently than the gas-poor star-forming galaxies and passive galaxies located in the virialized region of this cluster. The results imply that the galaxies experienced ram-pressure stripping and/or strangulation during the course of infall toward the cluster center and then the molecular gas in the galaxies at the cluster center was depleted by star formation.},

  abstract = {Deep optical surveys probe the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosities of high-redshift galaxies. They can therefore be used to infer star formation rates, under assumptions about young stellar populations. Current data suggest that the global star formation rate of the Universe peaked at a redshift of z = 1, then subsequently declined, leading to claims that the bulk of star formation in the Universe has been seen. However, the large uncertainties inherent in correcting for ultraviolet absorption by dust associated with young stars suggest that these formation rates might be substantially underestimated in high-redshift galaxies. Here, we circumvent this problem by considering the dust thermal emission at infrared (and submillimeter) wavelengths. We propose an improved determination of the long sought cosmic infrared background (built up from the accumulated infrared light of faint galaxies along the line of sight), from which we are able to estimate the required population of high-redshift, dust-enshrouded starburst galaxies. We argue that most of the star formation at high redshift may be hidden by dust, and we define the necessary characteristics of a feasible far-infrared survey that could detect this population.},

  abstract      = {Submillimetre-bright galaxies at high redshift are the most luminous, heavily star-forming galaxies in the Universe and are characterized by prodigious emission in the far-infrared, with a flux of at least five millijanskys at a wavelength of 850 micrometres. They reside in haloes with masses about 10$^{13}$ times that of the Sun, have low gas fractions compared to main-sequence disks at a comparable redshift, trace complex environments and are not easily observable at optical wavelengths. Their physical origin remains unclear. Simulations have been able to form galaxies with the requisite luminosities, but have otherwise been unable to simultaneously match the stellar masses, star formation rates, gas fractions and environments. Here we report a cosmological hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulation that is able to form a submillimetre galaxy that simultaneously satisfies the broad range of observed physical constraints. We find that groups of galaxies residing in massive dark matter haloes have increasing rates of star formation that peak at collective rates of about 500-1,000 solar masses per year at redshifts of two to three, by which time the interstellar medium is sufficiently enriched with metals that the region may be observed as a submillimetre-selected system. The intense star formation rates are fuelled in part by the infall of a reservoir gas supply enabled by stellar feedback at earlier times, not through major mergers. With a lifetime of nearly a billion years, our simulations show that the submillimetre-bright phase of high-redshift galaxies is prolonged and associated with significant mass buildup in early-Universe proto-clusters, and that many submillimetre-bright galaxies are composed of numerous unresolved components (for which there is some observational evidence).},

This conclusion is reached based on emerging data sets for ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/824/1/36/apj523272ieqn2.gif] {$z\gt 2$} proto-clusters and the characteristics of their member galaxies, in particular, rare starbursts and ultraluminous active galactic nuclei (AGN). The most challenging observational hurdle in identifying such structures is their very large volumes, ∼10 4 comoving Mpc 3 at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/824/1/36/apj523272ieqn3.gif] {$z\gt 2$} , subtending areas of approximately half a degree on the sky. Thus, the contrast afforded by an overabundance of very rare galaxies in comparison to the background can more easily distinguish overdense structures from the surrounding, normal density field. Five ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/824/1/36/apj523272ieqn4.gif] {$2\lesssim z\lesssim 3$} proto-clusters from the literature are discussed in detail and are found to contain up to 12 dusty starbursts or luminous AGN galaxies each, a phenomenon that is unlikely to occur by chance even in overdense environments. These are contrasted with three higher-redshift ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/824/1/36/apj523272ieqn5.gif] {$4\lesssim z\lesssim 5.5$} ) dusty star-forming galaxy (DSFG) groups, whose evolutionary fate is less clear. Measurements of DSFGs’ gas depletion times suggest that they are indeed short-lived on ∼100 Myr timescales, and accordingly the probability of finding a structure containing more than 8 such systems is ∼0.2%, unless their “triggering” is correlated on very large spatial scales, ∼10 Mpc across. The volume density of DSFG-rich proto-clusters is found to be comparable to all of the >10 15 M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/824/1/36/apj523272ieqn6.gif] {${}_{\odot }$} galaxy clusters in the nearby universe, which is a factor of five larger than expected in some simulations. Some tension still exists between measurements of the volume density of DSFG-rich proto-clusters and the expectation that they are generated via short-lived episodes, as the latter suggests that only a fraction ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/824/1/36/apj523272ieqn7.gif] {$\lt \tfrac{1}{2}$} ) of all proto-clusters should be rich with DSFGs. However, improved observations of proto-clusters over large regions of sky will certainly shed more light on the assembly of galaxy clusters, and whether or not they build their galaxies through episodic bursts as suggested here.},

Here we report observations of a quasar (ULASJ112001.48+064124.3) at a redshift of 7.085, which is 0.77 billion years after the Big Bang. ULASJ1120+0641 has a luminosity of 6.3{\times}10$^{13}$L$_{solar}$ and hosts a black hole with a mass of 2{\times}10$^{9}$M$_{solar}$ (where L$_{solar}$ and M$_{solar}$ are the luminosity and mass of the Sun). The measured radius of the ionized near zone around ULASJ1120+0641 is 1.9megaparsecs, a factor of three smaller than is typical for quasars at redshifts between 6.0 and 6.4. The near-zone transmission profile is consistent with a Ly{$\alpha$} damping wing, suggesting that the neutral fraction of the intergalactic medium in front of ULASJ1120+0641 exceeded 0.1.},

The existence of such black holes when the Universe was less than one billion years old presents substantial challenges to theories of the formation and growth of black holes and the coevolution of black holes and galaxies. Here we report the discovery of an ultraluminous quasar, SDSS J010013.02+280225.8, at redshift z = 6.30.

On the basis of the deep absorption trough on the blue side of the Lyman-{$\alpha$} emission line in the spectrum, we estimate the proper size of the ionized proximity zone associated with the quasar to be about 26 million light years, larger than found with other z $\gt$ 6.1 quasars with lower luminosities. We estimate (on the basis of a near-infrared spectrum) that the black hole has a mass of \~{}1.2 {\times} 10$^{10}$ , which is consistent with the 1.3 {\times} 10$^{10}$  derived by assuming an Eddington-limited accretion rate.},

  abstract = {Galaxies with stellar masses near M * contain the majority of stellar mass in the universe, and are therefore of special interest in the study of galaxy evolution. The Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) have present-day stellar masses near M *, at 5 × 10 10 M ☉ (defined here to be MW-mass) and 10 11 M ☉ (defined to be M31-mass). We study the typical progenitors of these galaxies using the FOURSTAR Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE). ZFOURGE is a deep medium-band near-IR imaging survey, which is sensitive to the progenitors of these galaxies out to z ~ 3. We use abundance-matching techniques to identify the main progenitors of these galaxies at higher redshifts. We measure the evolution in the stellar mass, rest-frame colors, morphologies, far-IR luminosities, and star formation rates, combining our deep multiwavelength imaging with near-IR Hubble Space Telescope imaging from Cosmic Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS), and Spitzer and Herschel far-IR imaging from Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-Herschel and CANDELS-Herschel. The typical MW-mass and M31-mass progenitors passed through the same evolution stages, evolving from blue, star-forming disk galaxies at the earliest stages to redder dust-obscured IR-luminous galaxies in intermediate stages and to red, more quiescent galaxies at their latest stages. The progenitors of the MW-mass galaxies reached each evolutionary stage at later times (lower redshifts) and with stellar masses that are a factor of two to three lower than the progenitors of the M31-mass galaxies. The process driving this evolution, including the suppression of star formation in present-day M * galaxies, requires an evolving stellar-mass/halo-mass ratio and/or evolving halo-mass threshold for quiescent galaxies. The effective size and SFRs imply that the baryonic cold-gas fractions drop as galaxies evolve from high redshift to z ~ 0 and are strongly anticorrelated with an increase in the Sérsic index. Therefore, the growth of galaxy bulges in M * galaxies corresponds to a rapid decline in the galaxy gas fractions and/or a decrease in the star formation efficiency.},

  abstract = {We develop a model for the cosmological role of mergers in the evolution of starbursts, quasars, and spheroidal galaxies. By combining theoretically well-constrained halo and subhalo mass functions as a function of redshift and environment with empirical halo occupation models, we can estimate where galaxies of given properties live at a particular epoch. This allows us to calculate, in an a priori cosmological manner, where major galaxy-galaxy mergers occur and what kinds of galaxies merge, at all redshifts. We compare this with the observed mass functions, clustering, fractions as a function of halo and galaxy mass, and small-scale environments of mergers, and we show that this approach yields robust estimates in good agreement with observations and can be extended to predict detailed properties of mergers. Making the simple Ansatz that major, gas-rich mergers cause quasar activity (but not strictly assuming they are the only triggering mechanism), we demonstrate that this model naturally reproduces the observed rise and fall of the quasar luminosity density at z = 0–6, as well as quasar luminosity functions, fractions, host galaxy colors, and clustering as a function of redshift and luminosity. The recent observed excess of quasar clustering on small scales at z ~ 0.2–2.5 is a natural prediction of our model, as mergers will preferentially occur in regions with excess small-scale galaxy overdensities. In fact, we demonstrate that quasar environments at all observed redshifts correspond closely to the empirically determined small group scale, where major mergers of ~ L * gas-rich galaxies will be most efficient. We contrast this with a secular model in which quasar activity is driven by bars or other disk instabilities, and we show that, while these modes of fueling probably dominate the high Eddington ratio population at Seyfert luminosities (significant at z = 0), the constraints from quasar clustering, observed pseudobulge populations, and disk mass functions suggest that they are a small contributor to the z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {gtrsim} 1 quasar luminosity density, which is dominated by massive BHs in predominantly classical spheroids formed in mergers. Similarly, low-luminosity Seyferts do not show a clustering excess on small scales, in agreement with the natural prediction of secular models, but bright quasars at all redshifts do so. We also compare recent observations of the colors of quasar host galaxies and show that these correspond to the colors of recent merger remnants, in the transition region between the blue cloud and the red sequence, and are distinct from the colors of systems with observed bars or strong disk instabilities. Even the most extreme secular models, in which all bulge (and therefore BH) formation proceeds via disk instability, are forced to assume that this instability acts before the (dynamically inevitable) mergers, and therefore predict a history for the quasar luminosity density that is shifted to earlier times, in disagreement with observations. Our model provides a powerful means to predict the abundance and nature of mergers and to contrast cosmologically motivated predictions of merger products such as starbursts and active galactic nuclei.},

Models suggest that the clumps form by gravitational instabilities, and if they resist disruption by star formation, then they interact, lose angular momentum, and migrate to the center to form a bulge. Here we study the properties of the bulges formed by this mechanism. They are all thick, slowly rotating, and have a high Sersic index, like classical bulges. Their rapid formation should also give them relatively high α-element abundances. We consider fourteen low-resolution models and four high-resolution models, three of which have supernova feedback. All models have an active halo, stellar disk, and gaseous disk; three of the models have a pre-existing bulge, and three others have a cuspy dark matter halo. All show the same basic result except the one with the highest feedback, in which the clumps are quickly destroyed and the disk thickens too much. The coalescence of massive disk clumps in the center of a galaxy is like a major merger in terms of orbital mixing. It differs by leaving a bulge with no specific dark matter component, unlike the merger of individual galaxies. Normal supernova feedback has little effect, because the high turbulent speed in the gas produces tightly bound clumps. A variety of indirect observations support the model, including clumpy disks with young bulges at high redshift and bulges with relatively little dark matter.},

  abstract = { ▪ Abstract The Universe is in transition. At early times, galactic evolution was dominated by hierarchical clustering and merging, processes that are violent and rapid. In the far future, evolution will mostly be secular—the slow rearrangement of energy and mass that results from interactions involving collective phenomena such as bars, oval disks, spiral structure, and triaxial dark halos. Both processes are important now. This review discusses internal secular evolution, concentrating on one important consequence, the buildup of dense central components in disk galaxies that look like classical, merger-built bulges but that were made slowly out of disk gas. We call these pseudobulges. We begin with an “existence proof”—a review of how bars rearrange disk gas into outer rings, inner rings, and stuff dumped onto the center. The results of numerical simulations correspond closely to the morphology of barred galaxies. In the simulations, gas is transported to small radii, where it reaches high densities and plausibly feeds star formation. In the observations, many barred and oval galaxies have dense central concentrations of gas and star formation. Optical colors and spectra often imply young stellar populations. So the formation of pseudobulges is well supported by theory and observations. It is embedded in a broader evolution picture that accounts for much of the richness observed in galaxy structure. If secular processes built dense central components that masquerade as bulges, how can we distinguish them from merger-built bulges? Observations show that pseudobulges retain a memory of their disky origin. That is, they have one or more characteristics of disks: (a) flatter shapes than those of classical bulges, (b) correspondingly large ratios of ordered to random velocities, (c) small velocity dispersions σ with respect to the Faber-Jackson correlation between σ and bulge lumi nosity, (d) spiral structure or nuclear bars in the “bulge” part of the light profile, (e) nearly exponential brightness profiles, and ( f ) starbursts. All these structures occur preferentially in barred and oval galaxies, where secular evolution should be most rapid. So the cleanest examples of pseudobulges are recognizable. Are their formation timescales plausible? We use measurements of central gas densities and star-formation rates to show that pseudobulges of the observed densities form on timescales of a few billion years. Thus a large variety of observational and theoretical results lead to a new picture of galaxy evolution that complements hierarchical clustering and merging. Secular evolution consists of more than the aging of stellar populations. Every galaxy is dynamically evolving. },

  abstract = {Using the cosmological baryonic accretion rate and normal star formation (SF) efficiencies, we present a very simple model for star-forming galaxies that accounts for the mass and redshift dependences of the star formation rate (SFR)-mass and Tully-Fisher (TF) relations from z ~ 2 to the present. The time evolution follows from the fact that each modeled galaxy approaches a steady state where the SFR follows the (net) cold gas accretion rate. The key feature of the model is a halo mass floor M min ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sime.gif] {sime} 10 11 M ☉ below which accretion is quenched in order to simultaneously account for the observed slopes of the SFR-mass and TF relations. The same successes cannot be achieved via an SF threshold (or delay) nor by varying the SF efficiency or the feedback efficiency. Combined with the mass ceiling for cold accretion due to virial shock heating, the mass floor M min explains galaxy "downsizing," where more massive galaxies formed earlier and over a shorter period of time. It turns out that the model also accounts for the observed galactic baryon and gas fractions as a function of mass and time, and the cosmic SFR density, which are all resulting from the mass floor M min . The model helps us to understand that it is the cosmological decline of accretion rate that drives the decrease of cosmic SFR density between z ~ 2 and z = 0 and the rise of the cosmic SFR density from z ~ 6 to z ~ 2 that allows us to put a constraint on our main parameter M min ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sime.gif] {sime} 10 11 M ☉ . Among the physical mechanisms that could be responsible for the mass floor, our view is that photoionization feedback (from first in situ hot stars) lowering the cooling efficiency is likely to play a large role.},

  abstract = {The star formation rates (SFRs) of low-metallicity galaxies depend sensitively on the gas metallicity, because metals are crucial to mediating the transition from intermediate-temperature atomic gas to cold molecular gas, a necessary precursor to star formation. We study the impact of this effect on the star formation history of galaxies. We incorporate metallicity-dependent star formation and metal enrichment in a simple model that follows the evolution of a halo main progenitor. Our model shows that including the effect of metallicity leads to suppression of star formation at redshift z > 2 in dark halos with masses ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 10 11 M ☉ , with the suppression becoming near total for halos below ~10 9.5 -10 10 M ☉ . We find that at high redshift, until z ~ 2, the SFR cannot catch up with the gas inflow rate (IR), because the SFR is limited by the free-fall time, and because it is suppressed further by a lack of metals in small halos. As a result, in each galaxy the SFR is growing in time faster than the IR, and the integrated cosmic SFR density is rising with time. The suppressed in situ SFR at high- z makes the growth of stellar mass dominated by ex situ SFR, meaning stars formed in lower mass progenitor galaxies and then accreted, which implies that the specific SFR (sSFR) remains constant with time. The intensely accreted gas at high- z is accumulating as an atomic gas reservoir. This provides additional fuel for star formation in 10 10 -10 12 M ☉ halos at z ~ 1-3, which allows the SFR to exceed the instantaneous IR, and may enable an even higher outflow rate. At z < 1, following the natural decline in IR with time due to the universal expansion, the SFR and sSFR are expected to drop. We specify the expected dependence of sSFR and metallicity on stellar mass and redshift. At a given z , and below a critical mass, these relations are predicted to be flat and rising, respectively. Our model predictions qualitatively match some of the puzzling features in the observed star formation history.},

We find that at 1 < z < 3 the passively evolving ETGs are the reddest and most massive objects in the universe, and we prove that a correlation between mass, morphology, color, and star formation activity is already in place at that epoch. We measure a significant evolution in the mass-size relation of passive ETGs from z ~ 3 to z ~ 1, with galaxies growing on average by a factor of two in size in a 3 Gyr timescale only.

We combine Advanced Camera for Surveys and Wide Field Camera 3 Hubble Space Telescope images to study the morphology of our galaxies in their optical rest frame in the entire 0 < z < 2.5 range. We find that throughout the explored redshift range the passive galaxies selected with our criteria have weak morphological K -correction, with size being slightly smaller in the optical than in the UV rest frame (by ~20% and ~10% at z > 1.2 and z < 1.2, respectively). We measure a significant evolution of the mass-size relation of ETGs, with a fractional increment that is almost independent of the stellar mass. ETGs formed at z > 1 appear to be preferentially small, and the evolution of the mass-size relation at z < 1 is driven by both the continuous size growth of the compact galaxies and the appearance of new ETGs with large sizes. We also find that the number density of all passive ETGs increases rapidly, by a factor of five, from z ~ 2 to z ~ 1, and then more mildly by another factor of 1.5 from z ~ 1 to z ~ 0. We interpret these results as evidence that the bulk of the ETGs are formed at 1 < z < 3 through a mechanism that leaves very compact remnants. At z < 1 the compact ETGs grow gradually in size, becoming normal-size galaxies, and at the same time new ETGs with normal-large sizes are formed.},

  abstract = {We point out a natural mechanism for quenching of star formation in early-type galaxies (ETGs). It automatically links the color of a galaxy with its morphology and does not require gas consumption, removal or termination of gas supply. Given that star formation takes place in gravitationally unstable gas disks, it can be quenched when a disk becomes stable against fragmentation to bound clumps. This can result from the growth of a stellar spheroid, for instance by mergers. We present the concept of morphological quenching (MQ) using standard disk instability analysis, and demonstrate its natural occurrence in a cosmological simulation using an efficient zoom-in technique. We show that the transition from a stellar disk to a spheroid can be sufficient to stabilize the gas disk, quench star formation, and turn an ETG red and dead while gas accretion continues. The turbulence necessary for disk stability can be stirred up by sheared perturbations within the disk in the absence of bound star-forming clumps. While other quenching mechanisms, such as gas stripping, active galactic nucleus feedback, virial shock heating, and gravitational heating are limited to massive halos, MQ can explain the appearance of red ETGs also in halos less massive than ~10 12 M ☉ . The dense gas disks observed in some of today's red ellipticals may be the relics of this mechanism, whereas red galaxies with quenched gas disks could be more frequent at high redshift.},

  abstract = {Disk galaxies at high redshift ( z ~ 2) are characterized by high fractions of cold gas, strong turbulence, and giant star-forming clumps. Major mergers of disk galaxies at high redshift should then generally involve such turbulent clumpy disks. Merger simulations, however, model the interstellar medium as a stable, homogeneous, and thermally pressurized medium. We present the first merger simulations with high fractions of cold, turbulent, and clumpy gas. We discuss the major new features of these models compared to models where the gas is artificially stabilized and warmed. Gas turbulence, which is already strong in high-redshift disks, is further enhanced in mergers. Some phases are dispersion dominated, with most of the gas kinetic energy in the form of velocity dispersion and very chaotic velocity fields, unlike merger models using a thermally stabilized gas. These mergers can reach very high star formation rates, and have multi-component gas spectra consistent with SubMillimeter Galaxies. Major mergers with high fractions of cold turbulent gas are also characterized by highly dissipative gas collapse to the center of mass, with the stellar component following in a global contraction. The final galaxies are early type with relatively small radii and high Sersic indices, like high-redshift compact spheroids. The mass fraction in a disk component that survives or re-forms after a merger is severely reduced compared to models with stabilized gas, and the formation of a massive disk component would require significant accretion of external baryons afterwards. Mergers thus appear to destroy extended disks even when the gas fraction is high, and this lends further support to smooth infall as the main formation mechanism for massive disk galaxies.},

However, the galactic winds are critical for their subsequent evolution. The giant clumps we obtain are short-lived and are disrupted by wind-driven mass loss. They do not virialize or migrate to the galaxy centers as suggested in recent work neglecting strong winds. By phenomenologically implementing the winds that are observed from high-redshift galaxies and in particular from individual clumps, our simulations reproduce well new observational constraints on clump kinematics and clump ages. In particular, the observation that older clumps appear closer to their galaxy centers is reproduced in our simulations, as a result of inside-out formation of the disks rather than inward clump migration.},

Together, this unique data set sheds light on how the assembled stellar mass is distributed within galaxies, and where new stars are being formed. We find the Hα morphologies to resemble more closely those observed in the ACS I band than in the WFC3 H band, especially for the larger systems. We next derive a novel prescription for Hα dust corrections, which accounts for extra extinction toward H II regions. The prescription leads to consistent star formation rate (SFR) estimates and reproduces the observed relation between the Hα/UV luminosity ratio and visual extinction, on both a pixel-by-pixel and a galaxy-integrated level. We find the surface density of star formation to correlate with the surface density of assembled stellar mass for spatially resolved regions within galaxies, akin to the so-called "main sequence of star formation" established on a galaxy-integrated level. Deviations from this relation toward lower equivalent widths are found in the inner regions of galaxies. Clumps and spiral features, on the other hand, are associated with enhanced Hα equivalent widths, bluer colors, and higher specific SFRs compared to the underlying disk. Their Hα/UV luminosity ratio is lower than that of the underlying disk, suggesting that the ACS clump selection preferentially picks up those regions of elevated star formation activity that are the least obscured by dust. Our analysis emphasizes that monochromatic studies of galaxy structure can be severely limited by mass-to-light ratio variations due to dust and spatially inhomogeneous star formation histories.},

  abstract = {Examining a sample of massive galaxies at 1.4 < z < 2.5 with K Vega < 22 from GOODS, we compare photometry from Spitzer at mid- and far-IR to submillimeter, radio, and rest-frame UV wavelengths, to test the agreement between different tracers of star formation rates (SFRs) and to explore the implications for galaxy assembly. For z ~ 2 galaxies with moderate luminosities ( L 8 μm < 10 11 L ☉ ), we find that the SFR can be estimated consistently from the multiwavelength data based on local luminosity correlations. However, 20%-30% of massive galaxies, and nearly all those with L 8 μm > 10 11 L ☉ , show a mid-IR excess that is likely due to the presence of obscured active nuclei, as shown in a companion paper. There is a tight and roughly linear correlation between stellar mass and SFR for 24 μm-detected galaxies. For a given mass, the SFR at z = 2 was larger by a factor of ~4 and ~30 relative to that in star-forming galaxies at z = 1 and 0, respectively. Typical ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z = 2 are relatively "transparent" to ultraviolet light, and their activity is long lived ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {gtrsim} 400 Myr), unlike that in local ULIRGs and high-redshift submillimeter-selected galaxies. ULIRGs are the common mode of star formation in massive galaxies at z = 2, and the high duty cycle suggests that major mergers are not the dominant trigger for this activity. Current galaxy formation models underpredict the normalization of the mass-SFR correlation by about a factor of 4 and the space density of ULIRGs by an order of magnitude but give better agreement for z > 1.4 quiescent galaxies.},

  abstract = {On 2017 August 17 a binary neutron star coalescence candidate (later designated GW170817) with merger time 12:41:04 UTC was observed through gravitational waves by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor independently detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) with a time delay of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/848/2/L12/apjlaa91c9ieqn1.gif] {$\sim 1.7\,{\rm{s}}$} with respect to the merger time. From the gravitational-wave signal, the source was initially localized to a sky region of 31 deg 2 at a luminosity distance of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/848/2/L12/apjlaa91c9ieqn2.gif] {${40}_{-8}^{+8}$} Mpc and with component masses consistent with neutron stars. The component masses were later measured to be in the range 0.86 to 2.26 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/848/2/L12/apjlaa91c9ieqn3.gif] {$\,{M}_{\odot }$} . An extensive observing campaign was launched across the electromagnetic spectrum leading to the discovery of a bright optical transient (SSS17a, now with the IAU identification of AT 2017gfo) in NGC 4993 (at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/848/2/L12/apjlaa91c9ieqn4.gif] {$\sim 40\,{\rm{Mpc}}$} ) less than 11 hours after the merger by the One-Meter, Two Hemisphere (1M2H) team using the 1 m Swope Telescope. The optical transient was independently detected by multiple teams within an hour. Subsequent observations targeted the object and its environment. Early ultraviolet observations revealed a blue transient that faded within 48 hours. Optical and infrared observations showed a redward evolution over ∼10 days. Following early non-detections, X-ray and radio emission were discovered at the transient’s position ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/848/2/L12/apjlaa91c9ieqn5.gif] {$\sim 9$} and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/848/2/L12/apjlaa91c9ieqn6.gif] {$\sim 16$} days, respectively, after the merger. Both the X-ray and radio emission likely arise from a physical process that is distinct from the one that generates the UV/optical/near-infrared emission. No ultra-high-energy gamma-rays and no neutrino candidates consistent with the source were found in follow-up searches. These observations support the hypothesis that GW170817 was produced by the merger of two neutron stars in NGC 4993 followed by a short gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) and a kilonova/macronova powered by the radioactive decay of r -process nuclei synthesized in the ejecta.},

  abstract      = {We present a possible observing scenario for the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors over the next decade, with the intention of providing information to the astronomy community to facilitate planning for multi-messenger astronomy with gravitational waves. We determine the expected sensitivity of the network to transient gravitational-wave signals, and study the capability of the network to determine the sky location of the source. We report our findings for gravitational-wave transients, with particular focus on gravitational-wave signals from the inspiral of binary neutron-star systems, which are considered the most promising for multi-messenger astronomy. The ability to localize the sources of the detected signals depends on the geographical distribution of the detectors and their relative sensitivity, and 90\% credible regions can be as large as thousands of square degrees when only two sensitive detectors are operational. Determining the sky position of a significant fraction of detected signals to areas of 5 deg$^{2}$ to 20 deg$^{2}$ will require at least three detectors of sensitivity within a factor of {\tilde} 2 of each other and with a broad frequency bandwidth. Should the third LIGO detector be relocated to India as expected, a significant fraction of gravitational-wave signals will be localized to a few square degrees by gravitational-wave observations alone.},

  abstract = {On 2017 August 17 at 12:41:06 UTC the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) detected and triggered on the short gamma-ray burst (GRB) 170817A. Approximately 1.7 s prior to this GRB, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory triggered on a binary compact merger candidate associated with the GRB. This is the first unambiguous coincident observation of gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation from a single astrophysical source and marks the start of gravitational-wave multi-messenger astronomy. We report the GBM observations and analysis of this ordinary short GRB, which extraordinarily confirms that at least some short GRBs are produced by binary compact mergers.},

  abstract = {We report the INTernational Gamma-ray Astrophysics Laboratory ( INTEGRAL ) detection of the short gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A (discovered by Fermi -GBM) with a signal-to-noise ratio of 4.6, and, for the first time, its association with the gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron star (BNS) merging event GW170817 detected by the LIGO and Virgo observatories. The significance of association between the gamma-ray burst observed by INTEGRAL and GW170817 is 3.2σ, while the association between the Fermi -GBM and INTEGRAL detections is 4.2σ. GRB 170817A was detected by the SPI-ACS instrument about 2 s after the end of the GW event. We measure a fluence of (1.4 ± 0.4 ± 0.6) × 10 −7 erg cm −2 (75–2000 keV), where, respectively, the statistical error is given at the 1σ confidence level, and the systematic error corresponds to the uncertainty in the spectral model and instrument response. We also report on the pointed follow-up observations carried out by INTEGRAL , starting 19.5 hr after the event, and lasting for 5.4 days. We provide a stringent upper limit on any electromagnetic signal in a very broad energy range, from 3 keV to 8 MeV, constraining the soft gamma-ray afterglow flux to <7.1 × 10 −11 erg cm −2 s −1 (80–300 keV). Exploiting the unique capabilities of INTEGRAL , we constrained the gamma-ray line emission from radioactive decays that are expected to be the principal source of the energy behind a kilonova event following a BNS coalescence. Finally, we put a stringent upper limit on any delayed bursting activity, for example, from a newly formed magnetar.},

  abstract = {On 2017 August 17, the gravitational-wave event GW170817 was observed by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, and the gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 170817A was observed independently by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor, and the Anti-Coincidence Shield for the Spectrometer for the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory . The probability of the near-simultaneous temporal and spatial observation of GRB 170817A and GW170817 occurring by chance is ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/848/2/L13/apjlaa920cieqn1.gif] {$5.0\times {10}^{-8}$} . We therefore confirm binary neutron star mergers as a progenitor of short GRBs. The association of GW170817 and GRB 170817A provides new insight into fundamental physics and the origin of short GRBs. We use the observed time delay of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/848/2/L13/apjlaa920cieqn2.gif] {$(+1.74\pm 0.05)\,{\rm{s}}$} between GRB 170817A and GW170817 to: (i) constrain the difference between the speed of gravity and the speed of light to be between ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/848/2/L13/apjlaa920cieqn3.gif] {$-3\times {10}^{-15}$} and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/848/2/L13/apjlaa920cieqn4.gif] {$+7\times {10}^{-16}$} times the speed of light, (ii) place new bounds on the violation of Lorentz invariance, (iii) present a new test of the equivalence principle by constraining the Shapiro delay between gravitational and electromagnetic radiation. We also use the time delay to constrain the size and bulk Lorentz factor of the region emitting the gamma-rays. GRB 170817A is the closest short GRB with a known distance, but is between 2 and 6 orders of magnitude less energetic than other bursts with measured redshift. A new generation of gamma-ray detectors, and subthreshold searches in existing detectors, will be essential to detect similar short bursts at greater distances. Finally, we predict a joint detection rate for the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor and the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors of 0.1–1.4 per year during the 2018–2019 observing run and 0.3–1.7 per year at design sensitivity.},

  abstract = {We quantify the morphological evolution of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn1.gif] {$z\sim 0$} massive galaxies ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn2.gif] {${M}_{*}/{M}_{\odot }\sim {10}^{11.2\pm 0.3}$} ) from ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn3.gif] {$z\sim 3$} in the 5 CANDELS fields. The progenitors are selected using abundance matching techniques to account for the mass growth. At ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn4.gif] {$z\lt 1$} , the population matches the massive end of the Hubble sequence, with 30% of pure spheroids, 50% of galaxies with equally dominant disk and bulge components, and 20% of disks. At ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn5.gif] {$z\sim 2-3$} however, there is a majority of irregular systems ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn6.gif] {$\sim 60\%-70\%$} ) with still 30% of pure spheroids. We then analyze the stellar populations, star formation rates (SFRs), gas fractions, and structural properties for the different morphologies independently. Our results suggest two distinct channels for the growth of bulges in massive galaxies. Around ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn7.gif] {$\sim 30\%-40\%$} were already bulges at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn8.gif] {$z\sim 2.5$} , with low average SFRs and gas fractions ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn9.gif] {$10\%-15\%$} ), high Sérsic indices ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn10.gif] {$n\gt 3-4$} ), and small effective radii ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn11.gif] {${R}_{{\rm{e}}}\sim 1$} kpc), pointing toward an even earlier formation through gas-rich mergers or violent disk instabilities. Between ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn12.gif] {$z\sim 2.5$} and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn13.gif] {$z\sim 0$} , they rapidly increase their size by a factor of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn14.gif] {$\sim 4-5$} , are quenched, and slightly increase their Sérsic indices ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn15.gif] {$n\sim 5$} ) but their global morphology remains unaltered. The structural evolution is independent of the gas fractions, suggesting that it is driven by ex situ events. The remaining 60% experience a gradual morphological transformation, from clumpy disks to more regular bulge+disk systems, essentially happening at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn16.gif] {$z\gt 1$} . This results in the growth of a significant bulge component ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn17.gif] {$n\sim 3$} ) for 2/3 of the systems, possibly through the migration of clumps, while the remaining 1/3 retain a rather small bulge ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn20.gif] {$n\sim 1.5-2$} ). The transition phase between disturbed and relaxed systems and the emergence of the bulge is correlated with a decrease in the star formation activity and the gas fractions, suggesting a morphological quenching process as a plausible mechanism for the formation of these bulges.},

While most of these massive galaxies must have subsequently transformed through on-going star formation and mergers with other galaxies, a small fraction ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 0.1%) may have survived untouched until today. Searches for such relic galaxies, useful windows to explore the early universe, have been inconclusive to date: galaxies with masses and sizes like those observed at high redshift ( M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sstarf.gif] {sstarf} ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 10 11 M ☉ ; R e ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 1.5 kpc) have been found in the local universe, but their stars are far too young for the galaxy to be a relic galaxy. This paper explores the first case of a nearby galaxy, NGC 1277 (at a distance of 73 Mpc in the Perseus galaxy cluster), which fulfills many criteria to be considered a relic galaxy. Using deep optical spectroscopy, we derive the star formation history along the structure of the galaxy: the stellar populations are uniformly old (>10 Gyr) with no evidence for more recent star formation episodes. The metallicity of their stars is super-solar ([Fe/H] = 0.20 ± 0.04 with a smooth decline toward the outer regions) and α-enriched ([α/Fe] = 0.4 ± 0.1). This suggests a very short formation time scale for the bulk of the stars in this galaxy. This object also rotates very fast ( V rot ~ 300 km s –1 ) and has a large central velocity dispersion (σ > 300 km s –1 ). NGC 1277 allows the exploration in full detail of properties such as the structure, internal dynamics, metallicity, and initial mass function as they were at ~10-12 Gyr ago when the first massive galaxies were built.},

After converting literature B -band disk galaxy magnitudes into inclination- and dust-corrected bulge magnitudes, via a useful new equation presented herein, we obtain a similar result. Unlike with the M bh -(velocity dispersion) diagram, which is also updated here using the same galaxy sample, it remains unknown whether barred and non-barred Sérsic galaxies are offset from each other in the M bh - L diagram. While black hole feedback has typically been invoked to explain what was previously thought to be a nearly constant M bh / M Spheroid mass ratio of ~0.2%, we advocate that the near-linear M bh - L and M bh - M Spheroid relations observed at high masses may have instead arisen largely from the additive dry merging of galaxies. We argue that feedback results in a dramatically different scaling relation, such that black hole mass scales roughly quadratically with the spheroid mass in Sérsic galaxies. We therefore introduce a revised cold-gas "quasar" mode feeding equation for semi-analytical models to reflect what we dub the quadratic growth of black holes in Sérsic galaxies built amidst gas-rich processes. Finally, we use our new Sérsic M bh - L equations to predict the masses of candidate intermediate mass black holes in almost 50 low-luminosity spheroids containing active galactic nuclei, finding many masses between that of stellar mass black holes and supermassive black holes.},

These claims have been based on studies that measured the half-light radii of galaxies as though they are all single-component systems. Here we identify 21 spheroidal stellar systems within 90 Mpc that have half-light, major-axis radii ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/804/1/32/apj510732ieqn1.gif] {${{R}_{{\rm e}}}\lesssim 2$} kpc, stellar masses ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/804/1/32/apj510732ieqn2.gif] {$0.7\times {{10}^{11}}\lt {{M}_{*}}/\;{{M}_{\odot }}\lt 1.4\times {{10}^{11}}$} , and Sérsic indices typically around a value of n = 2–3.

Moreover, this number density is a lower limit because it has not come from a volume-limited sample. The actual density may be closer to 10 −4 , although further work is required to confirm this. We therefore conclude that not all massive “spheroids” have undergone dramatic structural and size evolution since z ∼ 2 ± 0.6. Given that the bulges of local early-type disk galaxies are known to consist of predominantly old stars that existed at z ∼ 2, it seems likely that some of the observed high-redshift spheroids did not increase in size by building (three-dimensional) triaxial envelopes as commonly advocated, and that the growth of (two-dimensional) disks has also been important over the past 9–11 billion years.},

  abstract      = {We present Bayesian Analysis of Galaxies for Physical Inference and Parameter EStimation, or BAGPIPES, a new Python tool which can be used to rapidly generate complex model galaxy spectra and to fit these to arbitrary combinations of spectroscopic and photometric data using the MultiNest algorithm. We extensively test our ability to recover realistic star-formation histories (SFHs) with BAGPIPES by fitting mock observations of quiescent galaxies from the MUFASA simulation. We show that a double-power-law model produces better agreement with realistic SFHs than an exponentially-declining model. We then perform a detailed analysis of the SFHs of a sample of 9312 quiescent galaxies from UltraVISTA with stellar masses, $M\_* \gt 10^{10}\ \mathrm{M\_\odot}$ and redshifts $0.25 \lt z\_\mathrm{obs} \lt 3.75$. The majority of our quiescent sample exhibit SFHs which rise gradually then quench relatively rapidly, over $\sim 1{-}2$ Gyr. This behaviour is consistent with recent cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, where AGN-driven feedback in the low-accretion (jet) mode is the dominant quenching mechanism. In addition, we identify two further subsets of objects with distinct SFH shapes. At $z\_\mathrm{obs} \gtrsim 1$ we find a class of objects with SFHs which rise and fall very rapidly, with quenching timescales of $\lesssim 1$ Gyr. These objects are consistent with (potentially merger-triggered) quasar-mode AGN feedback. Also, at $z\_\mathrm{obs} \lesssim 1$ we find a population with SFHs which quench more slowly than they rise, over $\gtrsim3$ Gyr, which we speculate to be the result of a 'natural' quenching process, where galaxy SFHs die down gradually due to the diminishing overall cosmic gas supply. Purely passive evolution of the quiescent population at $z\_\mathrm{obs} \gtrsim 0.5$ is disfavoured by our results.},

By use of the photometric data from ALHAMBRA, we determine stellar population parameters of quiescent galaxies using the SED-fitting code MUFFIT and different SSP models. Through the extinctions retrieved by MUFFIT, we remove dusty star forming galaxies from the sample. The distribution of all the stellar populations parameters is also fitted by a bidimensional and locally weighted regression method (LOESS) across the rest-frame diagrams to reduce the impact of uncertainties and provide the distribution of stellar population parameters. Quiescent galaxies selected via $UVJ$ diagrams are typically contaminated by a \~{}20\% fraction of dusty star forming galaxies. A significant part of the galaxies that reside in the green valley are actually obscured star-forming galaxies (\~{}65\%). Therefore, the transition of galaxies from the blue cloud to the red sequence, and hence the related mechanisms for quenching, seems to be much more efficient and faster than previously considered. There are well defined correlations in both the rest-frame stellar mass- and $UVJ$ colour-colour diagrams that allow to constrain the ages, metallicities, extinctions, and sSFR of quiescent galaxies with only their rest-frame colours, redshifts and stellar masses. Dust corrections play an important role in understanding how quiescent galaxies are distributed in these diagrams. To perform a pure non-biased selection of quiescent galaxies from these diagrams is key to include dust corrections of the involved colours and also the galaxy stellar mass.},

Green valley galaxies are found to have intermediate dust attenuation and reside in the middle of the regions occupied by quiescent and star-forming galaxies in the UVJ diagram. Compared with blue and red galaxy populations at z < 2, green galaxies have intermediate compactness and morphological parameters. The above findings seem to favor the scenario that green galaxies are at a transitional phase when star-forming galaxies are being quenched into quiescent status. The green galaxies at z < 2 show the highest AGN fraction, suggesting that AGN feedback may have played an important role in star formation quenching. For the massive galaxies at2 < z < 2.5, both red and green galaxies are found to have a similarly higher AGN fraction than the blue ones, which implies that AGN feedback may help to keep quiescence of red galaxies at z > 2. A significant environmental difference is found between green and red galaxies at z  0.5 seem to have similar local density distributions, suggesting that environment quenching is not the major mechanism to cease star formation at z  > 0.5. The fractions of three populations as functions of mass support a “downsizing” quenching picture that the bulk of star formation in more massive galaxies is completed earlier than that of lower-mass galaxies.},

Based on the average size–mass relation in each redshift bin, we divide our galaxies at a given mass into Small SFGs (SSFGs; smaller than the average) and Large SFGs (LSFGs; larger than the average). We show that, at low masses ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/854/1/70/apjaaa5adieqn1.gif] {${M}_{* }\lt {10}^{10}{M}_{\odot }$} ), the SSFGs generally have nearly flat ε and A 4 profiles in both edge-on and face-on views, especially at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/854/1/70/apjaaa5adieqn2.gif] {$z\gt 1$} . Moreover, the median A 4 values at all radii are almost zero. In contrast, the highly inclined low-mass LSFGs in the same mass-redshift bins generally have monotonically increasing ε profiles with radius and disky feature dominated in the intermediate regions. These findings imply that at these redshifts, the low-mass SSFGs are not disk-like, whereas the low-mass LSFGs likely harbour disk-like components flattened by significant rotations. At high masses ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/854/1/70/apjaaa5adieqn3.gif] {${M}_{* }\gt {10}^{10}{M}_{\odot }$} ), both highly inclined SSFGs and LSFGs generally exhibit distinct trends in both ε and A 4 profiles, which increase at lower radii, reach maxima, then decrease at larger radii.

  abstract = {Forward modeling of the full galaxy SED is a powerful technique, providing self-consistent constraints on stellar ages, dust properties, and metallicities. However, the accuracy of these results is contingent on the accuracy of the model. One significant source of uncertainty is the contribution of obscured AGN, as they are relatively common and can produce substantial mid-IR (MIR) emission. Here we include emission from dusty AGN torii in the Prospector SED-fitting framework, and fit the UV–IR broadband photometry of 129 nearby galaxies. We find that 10% of the fitted galaxies host an AGN contributing >10% of the observed galaxy MIR luminosity. We demonstrate the necessity of this AGN component in the following ways. First, we compare observed spectral features to spectral features predicted from our model fit to the photometry. We find that the AGN component greatly improves predictions for observed H α and H β luminosities, as well as mid-infrared Akari and Spitzer /IRS spectra. Second, we show that inclusion of the AGN component changes stellar ages and SFRs by up to a factor of 10, and dust attenuations by up to a factor of 2.5. Finally, we show that the strength of our model AGN component correlates with independent AGN indicators, suggesting that these galaxies truly host AGN. Notably, only 46% of the SED-detected AGN would be detected with a simple MIR color selection. Based on these results, we conclude that SED models which fit MIR data without AGN components are vulnerable to substantial bias in their derived parameters.},

  abstract = {Post-starbursts are galaxies in transition from the blue cloud to the red sequence. Although they are rare today, integrated over time they may be an important pathway to the red sequence. This work uses Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Galaxy Evolution Explorer , and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer observations to identify the evolutionary sequence from starbursts to fully quenched post-starbursts (QPSBs) in the narrow mass range log M ( M ☉ ) = 10.3-10.7, and identifies "transiting" post-starbursts (TPSBs) which are intermediate between these two populations. In this mass range, ~0.3% of galaxies are starbursts, ~0.1% are QPSBs, and ~0.5% are the transiting types in between. The TPSBs have stellar properties that are predicted for fast-quenching starbursts and morphological characteristics that are already typical of early-type galaxies. The active galactic nucleus (AGN) fraction, as estimated from optical line ratios, of these post-starbursts is about three times higher ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 36% ± 8%) than that of normal star forming galaxies of the same mass, but there is a significant delay between the starburst phase and the peak of nuclear optical AGN activity (median age difference of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 200 ± 100 Myr), in agreement with previous studies. The time delay is inferred by comparing the broadband near-NUV-to-optical photometry with stellar population synthesis models. We also find that starbursts and post-starbursts are significantly more dust obscured than normal star forming galaxies in the same mass range. About 20% of the starbursts and 15% of the TPSBs can be classified as "dust-obscured galaxies" (DOGs), with a near-UV-to-mid-IR flux ratio of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 900, while only 0.8% of normal galaxies are DOGs. The time delay between the starburst phase and AGN activity suggests that AGNs do not play a primary role in the original quenching of starbursts but may be responsible for quenching later low-level star formation by removing gas and dust during the post-starburst phase.},

  abstract = {UV observations in the local universe have uncovered a population of early-type galaxies with UV flux consistent with low-level recent or ongoing star formation. Understanding the origin of such star formation remains an open issue. We present resolved UV-optical photometry of a sample of 19 Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) early-type galaxies at z ~ 0.1 drawn from the sample originally selected by Salim & Rich to lie in the bluer part of the green valley in the UV-optical color-magnitude diagram as measured by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer ( GALEX ). Utilizing high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) far-UV imaging provides unique insight into the distribution of UV light in these galaxies, which we call "extended star-forming early-type galaxies" (ESF-ETGs) because of extended UV emission that is indicative of recent star formation. The UV-optical color profiles of all ESF-ETGs show red centers and blue outer parts. Their outer colors require the existence of a significant underlying population of older stars in the UV-bright regions. An analysis of stacked SDSS spectra reveals weak LINER-like emission in their centers. Using a cross-matched SDSS DR7/ GALEX GR6 catalog, we search for other green valley galaxies with similar properties to these ESF-ETGs and estimate that ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 13% of dust-corrected green valley galaxies of similar stellar mass and UV-optical color are likely ESF-candidates, i.e., ESF-ETGs are not rare. Our results are consistent with star formation that is gradually declining in existing disks, i.e., the ESF-ETGs are evolving onto the red sequence for the first time, or with rejuvenated star formation due to accreted gas in older disks provided that the gas does not disrupt the structure of the galaxy and the resulting star formation is not too recent and bursty. ESF-ETGs may typify an important subpopulation of galaxies that can linger in the green valley for up to several Gyrs, based on their resemblance to nearby gas-rich green valley galaxies with low-level ongoing star formation.},

A sample is drawn from bulge-dominated Galaxy Evolution Explorer /Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( GALEX /SDSS) galaxies on the optical red sequence with strong UV excess and yet quiescent SDSS spectra. High-resolution far-UV imaging of 27 such ETGs using Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys/Solar Blind Channel (ACS/SBC) reveals structured UV morphology in 93% of the sample, consistent with low-level ongoing SF (~0.5 M ☉ yr –1 ). In 3/4 of the sample the SF is extended on galaxy scales (25-75 kpc), while the rest contains smaller (5-15 kpc) SF patches in the vicinity of an ETG—presumably gas-rich satellites being disrupted. Optical imaging reveals that all ETGs with galaxy-scale SF in our sample have old stellar disks (mostly S0 type). None is classified as a true elliptical. In our sample, galaxy-scale SF takes the form of UV rings of varying sizes and morphologies. For the majority of such objects we conclude that the gas needed to fuel current SF has been accreted from the intergalactic medium, probably in a prolonged, quasi-static manner, leading in some cases to additional disk buildup. The remaining ETGs with galaxy-scale SF have UV and optical morphologies consistent with minor merger-driven SF or with the final stages of SF in fading spirals. Our analysis excludes that all recent SF on the red sequence resulted from gas-rich mergers. We find further evidence that galaxy-scale SF is almost exclusively an S0 phenomenon (~20% S0s have SF) by examining the overall optically red SDSS ETGs. Conclusion is that significant number of field S0s maintain or resume low-level SF because the preventive feedback is not in place or is intermittent. True ellipticals, on the other hand, stay entirely quiescent even in the field.},

  abstract      = {Studies of galaxy surveys in the context of the cold dark matter paradigm have shown that the mass of the dark matter halo and the total stellar mass are coupled through a function that varies smoothly with mass. Their average ratio M$_{halo}$/M$_{stars}$ has a minimum of about 30 for galaxies with stellar masses near that of the Milky Way (approximately 5 {\times} 10$^{10}$ solar masses) and increases both towards lower masses and towards higher masses. The scatter in this relation is not well known; it is generally thought to be less than a factor of two for massive galaxies but much larger for dwarf galaxies. Here we report the radial velocities of ten luminous globular-cluster-like objects in the ultra-diffuse galaxy NGC1052{\ndash}DF2, which has a stellar mass of approximately 2 {\times} 10$^{8}$ solar masses. We infer that its velocity dispersion is less than 10.5 kilometres per second with 90 per cent confidence, and we determine from this that its total mass within a radius of 7.6 kiloparsecs is less than 3.4 {\times} 10$^{8}$ solar masses. This implies that the ratio M$_{halo}$/M$_{stars}$ is of order unity (and consistent with zero), a factor of at least 400 lower than expected. NGC1052{\ndash}DF2 demonstrates that dark matter is not always coupled with baryonic matter on galactic scales.},

This sample of eight star-forming galaxies at z\~{}2 selected among the most massive Herschel galaxies in the GOODS-South field is supplemented with eleven galaxies from the public data of the 1.3 mm survey of the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field. ALMA reveals systematically dense concentrations of dusty star-formation close to the center of the stellar component of the galaxies. We identify two different starburst regimes: (i) the classical population of starbursts located above the SFR-M* main sequence, with enhanced gas fractions and short depletion times and (ii) a sub-population of galaxies located within the scatter of the main sequence that experience compact star formation with depletion timescales typical of starbursts of \~{}150 Myr. In both starburst populations, the far infrared and UV are distributed in distinct regions and dust-corrected star formation rates estimated using UV-optical-NIR data alone underestimate the total star formation rate. Starbursts hidden in the main sequence show instead the lowest gas fractions of our sample and could represent the last stage of star-formation before they become passive. Being Herschel-selected, these main sequence galaxies are located in the high-mass end of the main sequence, hence we do not know whether these ``starbursts hidden in the main sequence'' also exist below 10\^{}11 Msun. Active galactic nuclei are found to be ubiquitous in these compact starbursts, suggesting that the triggering mechanism also feeds the central black hole or that the active nucleus triggers star formation.},

Their disturbed, bulge-dominated morphologies suggest that they are merger remnants. The more massive E+A galaxies are suggested to be quenched by AGN feedback, yet little is known about AGN-driven winds in this short-lived phase. We present spatially-resolved IFU spectroscopy by the Keck Cosmic Web Imager of SDSS J003443.68+251020.9, at z=0.118. The system consists of two galaxies, the larger of which is a post starburst E+A galaxy hosting an AGN. Our modelling suggests a 400 Myrs starburst, with a peak star formation rate of 120 Msun/yr. The observations reveal stationary and outflowing gas, photoionized by the central AGN. We detect gas outflows to a distance of 17 kpc from the central galaxy, far beyond the region of the stars (about 3 kpc), inside a conic structure with an opening angle of 70 degrees. We construct self-consistent photoionization and dynamical models for the different gas components and show that the gas outside the galaxy forms a continuous flow, with a mass outflow rate of about 24 Msun/yr. The gas mass in the flow, roughly $10^9$ Msun, is larger than the total gas mass within the galaxy, some of which is outflowing too. The continuity of the flow puts a lower limit of 60 Myrs on the duration of the AGN feedback. Such AGN are capable of removing, in a single episode, most of the gas from their host galaxies and expelling enriched material into the surrounding CGM.},

  abstract      = {In our modern understanding of galaxy formation, every galaxy forms within a dark matter halo. The formation and growth of galaxies over time is connected to the growth of the halos in which they form. The advent of large galaxy surveys as well as high-resolution cosmological simulations has provided a new window into the statistical relationship between galaxies and halos and its evolution. Here we define this galaxy-halo connection as the multi-variate distribution of galaxy and halo properties that can be derived from observations and simulations. This connection provides a key test of physical galaxy formation models; it also plays an essential role in constraints of cosmological models using galaxy surveys and in elucidating the properties of dark matter using galaxies. We review techniques for inferring the galaxy-halo connection and the insights that have arisen from these approaches. Some things we have learned are that galaxy formation efficiency is a strong function of halo mass; at its peak in halos around a pivot halo mass of 10\^{}12 Msun, less than 20\% of the available baryons have turned into stars by the present day; the intrinsic scatter in galaxy stellar mass is small, less than 0.2 dex at a given halo mass above this pivot mass; below this pivot mass galaxy stellar mass is a strong function of halo mass; the majority of stars over cosmic time were formed in a narrow region around this pivot mass. We also highlight key open questions about how galaxies and halos are connected, including understanding the correlations with secondary properties and the connection of these properties to galaxy clustering.},

Our model follows observed mass and luminosity functions of both star-forming and quiescent galaxies, and reproduces the redshift evolution of colors, sizes, star-formation and chemical properties of the observed galaxy population. Unlike other existing approaches, our model includes a self-consistent treatment of stellar and photoionized gas emission and dust attenuation based on the BEAGLE tool. The mock galaxy catalogs generated with our new model can be used to simulate and optimize extragalactic surveys with future facilities such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and to enable critical assessments of analysis procedures, interpretation tools, and measurement systematics for both photometric and spectroscopic data. As a first application of this work, we make predictions for the upcoming JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), a joint program of the JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec Guaranteed Time Observations teams. We show that JADES will detect, with NIRCam imaging, thousands of galaxies at z$\gt$6, and tens at z$\gt$10 at m\_AB$\lt$30 (5-sigma) within the 236 arcmin\^{}2 of the survey. The JADES data will enable accurate constraints on the evolution of the UV luminosity function at z$\gt$8, and resolve the current debate about the rate of evolution of galaxies at z$\gt$8.

  abstract      = {We present stellar rotation curves and velocity dispersion profiles for 104 quiescent galaxies at $z=0.6-1$ from the Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) spectroscopic survey. Rotation is typically probed across 10-20kpc, or to an average of 2.7${\rm R\_e}$. Combined with central stellar velocity dispersions ($\sigma\_0$) this provides the first determination of the dynamical state of a sample selected by a lack of star formation activity at large lookback time. The most massive galaxies ($M\_{\star}\gt2\times10^{11}\,M\_{\odot}$) generally show no or little rotation measured at 5kpc ($|V\_5|/\sigma\_0\lt0.2$ in 8 of 10 cases), while ${\sim}64\\%$ of less massive galaxies show significant rotation. This is reminiscent of local fast- and slow-rotating ellipticals and implies that low- and high-redshift quiescent galaxies have qualitatively similar dynamical structures. We compare $|V\_5|/\sigma\_0$ distributions at $z\sim0.8$ and the present day by re-binning and smoothing the kinematic maps of 91 low-redshift quiescent galaxies from the CALIFA survey and find evidence for a decrease in rotational support since $z\sim1$. This result is especially strong when galaxies are compared at fixed velocity dispersion; if velocity dispersion does not evolve for individual galaxies then the rotational velocity at 5kpc was an average of ${94\pm22\\%}$ higher in $z\sim0.8$ quiescent galaxies than today. Considering that the number of quiescent galaxies grows with time and that new additions to the population descend from rotationally-supported star-forming galaxies, our results imply that quiescent galaxies must lose angular momentum between $z\sim1$ and the present, presumably through dissipationless merging, and/or that the mechanism that transforms star-forming galaxies also reduces their rotational support.},

We match samples at different redshifts in UV luminosity and stellar mass, and perform systematic measurements of spectral features and stellar population modeling. By creating composite spectra grouped according to Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW), and various galaxy properties, we study the evolutionary trends among Ly$\alpha$, low- and high-ionization interstellar (LIS and HIS) absorption features, and integrated galaxy properties. We also examine the redshift evolution of Ly$\alpha$ and LIS absorption kinematics, and fine-structure emission EWs. The connections among the strengths of Ly$\alpha$, LIS lines, and dust extinction are redshift-independent, as is the decoupling of Ly$\alpha$ and HIS line strengths, and the bulk outflow kinematics as traced by LIS lines. Stronger Ly$\alpha$ emission is observed at higher redshift at fixed UV luminosity, stellar mass, SFR, and age. Much of this variation in average Ly$\alpha$ strength with redshift, and the variation in Ly$\alpha$ strength at fixed redshift, can be explained in terms of variations in neutral gas covering fraction and/or dust content in the ISM and CGM. However, based on the connection between Ly$\alpha$ and CIII] emission strengths, we additionally find evidence for variations in the intrinsic production rate of Ly$\alpha$ photons at the highest Ly$\alpha$ EWs. The challenge now is to understand the observed evolution in neutral gas covering fraction and dust extinction within a coherent model for galaxy formation, and make robust predictions for the escape of ionizing radiation at z $\gt$ 6.},

  abstract      = {In the local Universe, there is a strong division in the star-forming properties of low-mass galaxies, with star formation largely ubiquitous amongst the field population while satellite systems are predominantly quenched. This dichotomy implies that environmental processes play the dominant role in suppressing star formation within this low-mass regime (${M}\_{\star} \sim 10^{5.5-8}~{\rm M}\_{\odot}$). As shown by observations of the Local Volume, however, there is a non-negligible population of passive systems in the field, which challenges our understanding of quenching at low masses. By applying the satellite quenching models of Fillingham et al. (2015) to subhalo populations in the Exploring the Local Volume In Simulations (ELVIS) suite, we investigate the role of environmental processes in quenching star formation within the nearby field. Using model parameters that reproduce the satellite quenched fraction in the Local Group, we predict a quenched fraction -- due solely to environmental effects -- of $\sim 0.52 \pm 0.26$ within $1\lt R/R\_{\rm vir} \lt 2$ of the Milky Way and M31. This is in good agreement with current observations of the Local Volume and suggests that the majority of the passive field systems observed at these distances are quenched via environmental mechanisms. Beyond $2~R\_{\rm vir}$, however, dwarf galaxy quenching becomes difficult to explain through an interaction with either the Milky Way or M31, such that more isolated, field dwarfs may be self-quenched as a result of star-formation feedback.},

  abstract = {In order to try to understand the internal evolution of galaxies and relate this to the global evolution of the galaxy population, we present a comparative study of the dependence of star formation rates on the average surface mass densities (Σ M ) of galaxies at 0.5 < z < 0.9 and 0.04 < z < 0.08, using the zCOSMOS and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) surveys, respectively. We derive star formation rates, stellar masses, and structural parameters in a consistent way for both samples, and apply them to samples that are complete down to the same stellar mass at both redshifts. We first show that the characteristic step-function dependence of median specific star formation rate (SSFR) on Σ M in SDSS, seen by Brinchmann et al., is due to the change over from predominantly disk galaxies to predominantly spheroidal galaxies at the surface mass density logΣ M char ~8.5 at which the SSFR is seen to drop. Turning to zCOSMOS, we find a similar shape for the median SSFR-Σ M relation, but with median SSFR values that are about 5-6 times higher than for SDSS, across the whole range of Σ M , and in galaxies with both high and low Sersic indices. This emphasizes that galaxies of all types are contributing, proportionally, to the global increase in star formation rate density in the Universe back to these redshifts. The Σ M char "step" shifts to slightly higher values of Σ M in zCOSMOS relative to SDSS, but this can be explained by a modest differential evolution in the size-mass relations of disk and spheroid galaxies. For low Sersic index galaxies, there is little change in the size-mass relation, as seen by Barden et al., although we suggest that this does not necessarily imply inside-out growth of disks, at least not in this redshift range. On the other hand, there is a modest evolution in the stellar mass-size relation for high Sersic index galaxies, with galaxies smaller by ~25% at z ~ 0.7. Taken together these produce a modest increase in Σ M char . Low Sersic index galaxies have a SSFR that is almost independent of Σ M , and the same is probably also true of high Sersic index galaxies once obvious disk systems are excluded.},

  abstract = {We analyze very deep HST , VLT, and Spitzer photometry of galaxies at 2 < z < 3.5 in the Hubble Deep Field-South. The sample is selected from the deepest public K -band imaging currently available. We show that the rest-frame U - V versus V - J color-color diagram is a powerful diagnostic of the stellar populations of distant galaxies. Galaxies with red rest-frame U - V colors are generally red in rest-frame V - J as well. However, at a given U - V color a range in V - J colors exists, and we show that this allows us to distinguish young, dusty galaxies from old, passively evolving galaxies. We quantify the effects of IRAC photometry on estimates of masses, ages, and the dust content of z > 2 galaxies. The estimated distributions of these properties do not change significantly when IRAC data are added to the UBVIJHK photometry. However, for individual galaxies the addition of IRAC can improve the constraints on the stellar populations, especially for red galaxies: uncertainties in stellar mass decrease by a factor of 2.7 for red [( U − V ) rest > 1] galaxies, but only by a factor of 1.3 for blue [( U − V ) rest < 1] galaxies. We find a similar color dependence of the improvement for estimates of age and dust extinction. In addition, the improvement from adding IRAC depends on the availability of full NIR JHK coverage; if only K band were available, the mass uncertainties of blue galaxies would decrease by a more substantial factor of 1.9. Finally, we find that a trend of galaxy color with stellar mass is already present at z > 2. The most massive galaxies at high redshift have red rest-frame U - V colors compared to lower mass galaxies, even when allowing for complex star formation histories.},

From the UKIDSS Ultra-Deep Survey Data Release 1, with matched optical and mid-infrared photometry taken from the Subaru- XMM Deep Survey and Spitzer Wide-Area Infrared Extragalactic Survey, respectively, we construct a K -selected galaxy catalog and calculate photometric redshifts. Excluding stars, objects with uncertain z phot solutions, those that fall in bad or incomplete survey regions, and those for which reliable rest-frame colors could not be derived, 30,108 galaxies with K < 22.4 (AB) and z phot ≤ 2.5 remain. The galaxies in this sample are found to occupy two distinct populations in the rest-frame U – V versus V – J color space: a clump of red, quiescent galaxies (analogous to the red sequence) and a track of star-forming galaxies extending from blue to red U – V colors. This bimodal behavior is seen up to z ~ 2. Due to a combination of measurement errors and passive evolution, the color-color diagram is not suitable to distinguish the galaxy bimodality at z > 2 for this sample, but we show that MIPS 24 μm data suggest that a significant population of quiescent galaxies exists even at these higher redshifts. At z = 1-2, the most luminous objects in the sample are divided roughly equally between star-forming and quiescent galaxies, while at lower redshifts most of the brightest galaxies are quiescent. Moreover, quiescent galaxies at these redshifts are clustered more strongly than those actively forming stars, indicating that galaxies with early-quenched star formation may occupy more massive host dark matter halos. This suggests that the end of star formation is associated with, and perhaps brought about by, a mechanism related to halo mass.},

  abstract = {We use a large sample of galaxies from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to calculate galaxy luminosity and stellar mass functions in the local universe. We estimate corrections for passband shifting and galaxy evolution, as well as present-day stellar mass-to-light ( M / L ) ratios, by fitting the optical-near-infrared galaxy data with simple models. Accounting for the 8% galaxy overdensity in the SDSS early data release region, the optical and near-infrared luminosity functions we construct for this sample agree with most recent literature optical and near-infrared determinations within the uncertainties. We argue that 2MASS is biased against low surface brightness galaxies and use SDSS plus our knowledge of stellar populations to estimate the "true" K -band luminosity function. This has a steeper faint end slope and a slightly higher overall luminosity density than the direct estimate. Furthermore, assuming a universally applicable stellar initial mass function (IMF), we find good agreement between the stellar mass function we derive from the 2MASS/SDSS data and that derived by Cole et al. The faint end slope for the stellar mass function is steeper than -1.1, reflecting the low stellar M / L ratios characteristic of low-mass galaxies. We estimate an upper limit to the stellar mass density in the local universe Ω * h = 2.0 ± 0.6 × 10 -3 by assuming an IMF as rich in low-mass stars as allowed by observations of galaxy dynamics in the local universe. The stellar mass density may be lower than this value if a different IMF with fewer low-mass stars is assumed. Finally, we examine type-dependence in the optical and near-infrared luminosity functions and the stellar mass function. In agreement with previous work, we find that the characteristic luminosity or mass of early-type galaxies is larger than for later types, and the faint end slope is steeper for later types than for earlier types. Accounting for typing uncertainties, we estimate that at least half, and perhaps as much as 3/4, of the stellar mass in the universe is in early-type galaxies. As an aid to workers in the field, we present in an Appendix the relationship between model stellar M / L ratios and colors in SDSS/2MASS passbands, an updated discussion of near-infrared stellar M / L ratio estimates, and the volume-corrected distribution of g - and K -band stellar M / L ratios as a function of stellar mass.},

We combine the effort from 10 different teams, who computed the stellar masses using the same photometry and the same redshifts. Each team adopted their preferred fitting code, assumptions, priors, and parameter grid. The combination of results using the same underlying stellar isochrones reduces the systematics associated with the fitting code and other choices. Thanks to the availability of different estimates, we can test the effect of some specific parameters and assumptions on the stellar mass estimate. The choice of the stellar isochrone library turns out to have the largest effect on the galaxy stellar mass estimates, resulting in the largest distributions around the median value (with a semi interquartile range larger than 0.1 dex). On the other hand, for most galaxies, the stellar mass estimates are relatively insensitive to the different parameterizations of the star formation history. The inclusion of nebular emission in the model spectra does not have a significant impact for the majority of galaxies (less than a factor of 2 for ~80% of the sample). Nevertheless, the stellar mass for the subsample of young galaxies (age <100 Myr), especially in particular redshift ranges (e.g., 2.2 < z < 2.4, 3.2 < z < 3.6, and 5.5 < z < 6.5), can be seriously overestimated (by up to a factor of 10 for <20 Myr sources) if nebular contribution is ignored.},

  abstract = {Petrosian magnitudes were designed to help with the difficult task of determining a galaxy's total light. Although these magnitudes [taken here as the flux within 2 R P , with the inverted Petrosian index 1/η( R P ) = 0.2] can represent most of an object's flux, they do of course miss the light outside the Petrosian aperture (2 R P ). The size of this flux deficit varies monotonically with the shape of a galaxy's light profile, i.e., its concentration. In the case of a de Vaucouleurs R 1/4 profile, the deficit is 0.20 mag; for an R 1/8 profile this figure rises to 0.50 mag. Here we provide a simple method for recovering total (Sérsic) magnitudes from Petrosian magnitudes using only the galaxy concentration ( R 90 / R 50 or R 80 / R 20 ) within the Petrosian aperture. The corrections hold to the extent that Sérsic's model provides a good description of a galaxy's luminosity profile. We show how the concentration can also be used to convert Petrosian radii into effective half-light radii, enabling a robust measure of the mean effective surface brightness. Our technique is applied to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 2 (SDSS DR2) Petrosian parameters, yielding good agreement with the total magnitudes, effective radii, and mean effective surface brightnesses obtained from the New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog Sérsic R 1/ n fits by Blanton and coworkers. Although the corrective procedure described here is specifically applicable to the SDSS DR2 and DR3, it is generally applicable to all imaging data where any Petrosian index and concentration can be constructed.},

In this Letter, we have measured the rest-frame NUV − B color gradients in ∼1400 large ( r e > 0.″18), nearly face-on ( b / a > 0.5) main sequence star-forming galaxies (SFGs) between redshift 0.5 and 1.5 in the CANDELS/GOODS-S and UDS fields. With this sample, we study the origin of UV–optical color gradients in the SFGs at z ∼ 1 and discuss their link with the buildup of stellar mass. We find that the more massive, centrally compact, and more dust extinguished SFGs tend to have statistically more negative raw color gradients (redder centers) than the less massive, centrally diffuse, and less dusty SFGs. After correcting for dust reddening based on optical-spectral energy distribution fitting, the color gradients in the low-mass ( M * < 10 10 M ⊙ ) SFGs generally become quite flat, while most of the high-mass ( M * > 10 10.5 M ⊙ ) SFGs still retain shallow negative color gradients. These findings imply that dust reddening is likely the principal cause of negative color gradients in the low-mass SFGs, while both increased central dust reddening and buildup of compact old bulges are likely the origins of negative color gradients in the high-mass SFGs. These findings also imply that at these redshifts the low-mass SFGs buildup their stellar masses in a self-similar way, while the high-mass SFGs grow inside out.},

  abstract = {We use ultra-deep Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3/infrared imaging of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field to investigate the rest-frame optical morphologies of a mass-selected sample of galaxies at z ~ 2. We find a large variety of galaxy morphologies, ranging from large, blue, disk-like galaxies to compact, red, early-type galaxies. We derive rest-frame u – g color profiles for these galaxies and show that most z ~ 2 galaxies in our sample have negative color gradients such that their cores are red. Although these color gradients may partly be caused by radial variations in dust content, they point to the existence of older stellar populations in the centers of z ~ 2 galaxies. This result is consistent with an "inside-out" scenario of galaxy growth. We find that the median color gradient is fairly constant with redshift: (Δ( u – g rest )/Δ(log r )) median = –0.47, –0.33, and –0.46 for z ~ 2, z ~ 1, and z = 0, respectively. Using structural parameters derived from surface brightness profiles we confirm that at z ~ 2 galaxy morphology correlates well with specific star formation rate. At the same mass, star-forming galaxies have larger effective radii, bluer rest-frame u – g colors, and lower Sérsic indices than quiescent galaxies. These correlations are very similar to those at lower redshift, suggesting that the relations that give rise to the Hubble sequence at z = 0 are already in place for massive galaxies at this early epoch.},

  abstract = {The DEEP2 and COMBO-17 surveys are compared to study luminosity functions of red and blue galaxies to z\~{}1. The two surveys have different methods and sensitivities, but nevertheless results agree. After z\~{}1, M$^{*}$$_{B}$ has dimmed by 1.2-1.3 mag for all colors of galaxies, {\phis}$^{*}$ for blue galaxies has hardly changed, and {\phis}$^{*}$ for red galaxies has at least doubled (our formal value is \~{}0.5 dex). Luminosity density j$_{B}$ has fallen by 0.6 dex for blue galaxies but has remained nearly constant for red galaxies. These results imply that the number and total stellar mass of blue galaxies have been substantially constant since z\~{}1, whereas those of red galaxies (near L$^{*}$) have been significantly rising. To explain the new red galaxies, a ``mixed'' scenario is proposed in which star formation in blue cloud galaxies is quenched, causing them to migrate to the red sequence, where they merge further in a small number of stellar mergers. This mixed scenario matches the local boxy-disky transition for nearby ellipticals, as well as red sequence stellar population scaling laws such as the color-magnitude and Mg-{$\sigma$} relations (which are explained as fossil relics from blue progenitors). Blue galaxies enter the red sequence via different quenching modes, each of which peaks at a different characteristic mass and time. The red sequence therefore likely builds up in different ways at different times and masses, and the concept of a single process that is ``downsizing'' (or upsizing) probably does not apply. Our claim in this paper of a rise in the number of red galaxies applies to galaxies near L$^{*}$. Accurate counts of brighter galaxies on the steep part of the Schechter function require more accurate photometry than is currently available.  Based on observations taken at the W. M.

  abstract      = {We use a sample of 90 spectroscopically confirmed Lyman break galaxies with H{$\alpha$} measurements and Spitzer MIPS 24 {$\mu$}m observations to constrain the relationship between rest-frame 8 {$\mu$}m luminosity (L $_{8}$) and star formation rate (SFR) for L* galaxies at z \~{} 2. We find a tight correlation with 0.24 dex scatter between L $_{8}$ and H{$\alpha$} luminosity/SFR for z \~{} 2 galaxies with 10$^{10}$ L $_{sun}$ $\lt$\~{} L $_{IR}$ $\lt$\~{} 10$^{12}$ L $_{sun}$. Employing this relationship with a larger sample of 392 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, we find that the UV slope {$\beta$} can be used to recover the dust attenuation of the vast majority of moderately luminous L* galaxies at z \~{} 2 to within a 0.4 dex scatter using the local correlation. Separately, young galaxies with ages lsim100 Myr appear to be less dusty than their UV slopes would imply based on the local trend and may follow an extinction curve that is steeper than what is typically assumed. Consequently, very young galaxies at high redshift may be significantly less dusty than inferred previously. Our results provide the first direct evidence, independent of the UV slope, for a correlation between UV and bolometric luminosity (L $_{bol}$) at high redshift, in the sense that UV-faint galaxies are on average less infrared and less bolometrically luminous than their UV-bright counterparts. The L $_{bol}$-L $_{UV}$ relation indicates that as the SFR increases, L $_{UV}$ turns over (or ``saturates'') around the value of L* at z \~{} 2, implying that dust obscuration may be largely responsible for modulating the bright end of the UV luminosity function. Finally, dust attenuation is found to correlate with oxygen abundance at z \~{} 2. Accounting for systematic differences in local and high-redshift metallicity calibrations, we find that L* galaxies at z \~{} 2, while at least an order of magnitude more bolometrically luminous, exhibit ratios of metals to dust that are similar to those of local starbursts. This result is expected if high-redshift galaxies are forming their stars in a less metal-rich environment compared to local galaxies of the same luminosity, thus naturally leading to a redshift evolution in both the bolometric luminosity-metallicity and bolometric luminosity-obscuration relations.

  abstract = {We analyze very deep HST, VLT, and Spitzer photometry of galaxies at 2$\lt$z$\lt$3.5 in the Hubble Deep Field-South. The sample is selected from the deepest public K-band imaging currently available. We show that the rest-frame U-V versus V-J color-color diagram is a powerful diagnostic of the stellar populations of distant galaxies. Galaxies with red rest-frame U-V colors are generally red in rest-frame V-J as well. However, at a given U-V color a range in V-J colors exists, and we show that this allows us to distinguish young, dusty galaxies from old, passively evolving galaxies. We quantify the effects of IRAC photometry on estimates of masses, ages, and the dust content of z$\gt$2 galaxies. The estimated distributions of these properties do not change significantly when IRAC data are added to the UBVIJHK photometry. However, for individual galaxies the addition of IRAC can improve the constraints on the stellar populations, especially for red galaxies: uncertainties in stellar mass decrease by a factor of 2.7 for red [(U-V)$_{rest}$$\gt$1] galaxies, but only by a factor of 1.3 for blue [(U-V)$_{rest}$$\lt$1] galaxies. We find a similar color dependence of the improvement for estimates of age and dust extinction. In addition, the improvement from adding IRAC depends on the availability of full NIR JHK coverage; if only K band were available, the mass uncertainties of blue galaxies would decrease by a more substantial factor of 1.9. Finally, we find that a trend of galaxy color with stellar mass is already present at z$\gt$2. The most massive galaxies at high redshift have red rest-frame U-V colors compared to lower mass galaxies, even when allowing for complex star formation histories.

From the UKIDSS Ultra-Deep Survey Data Release 1, with matched optical and mid-infrared photometry taken from the Subaru-XMM Deep Survey and Spitzer Wide-Area Infrared Extragalactic Survey, respectively, we construct a K-selected galaxy catalog and calculate photometric redshifts. Excluding stars, objects with uncertain z $_{phot}$ solutions, those that fall in bad or incomplete survey regions, and those for which reliable rest-frame colors could not be derived, 30,108 galaxies with K $\lt$ 22.4 (AB) and z $_{phot}$ $\lt$= 2.5 remain. The galaxies in this sample are found to occupy two distinct populations in the rest-frame U - V versus V - J color space: a clump of red, quiescent galaxies (analogous to the red sequence) and a track of star-forming galaxies extending from blue to red U - V colors. This bimodal behavior is seen up to z \~{} 2. Due to a combination of measurement errors and passive evolution, the color-color diagram is not suitable to distinguish the galaxy bimodality at z $\gt$ 2 for this sample, but we show that MIPS 24 {$\mu$}m data suggest that a significant population of quiescent galaxies exists even at these higher redshifts. At z = 1-2, the most luminous objects in the sample are divided roughly equally between star-forming and quiescent galaxies, while at lower redshifts most of the brightest galaxies are quiescent. Moreover, quiescent galaxies at these redshifts are clustered more strongly than those actively forming stars, indicating that galaxies with early-quenched star formation may occupy more massive host dark matter halos. This suggests that the end of star formation is associated with, and perhaps brought about by, a mechanism related to halo mass.

  abstract      = {The presence of massive, compact, quiescent galaxies at z$\gt$2 presents a major challenge for theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution. Using one of the deepest large public near-IR surveys to date, we investigate in detail the correlations between star formation and galaxy structural parameters (size, stellar mass, and surface density) from z = 2 to the present. At all redshifts, massive quiescent galaxies (i.e., those with little or no star formation) occupy the extreme high end of the surface density distribution and follow a tight mass-size correlation, while star-forming galaxies show a broad range of both densities and sizes. Conversely, galaxies with the highest surface densities comprise a nearly homogeneous population with little or no ongoing star formation, while less dense galaxies exhibit high star formation rates and varying levels of dust obscuration. Both the sizes and surface densities of quiescent galaxies evolve strongly from z = 2-0; we parameterize this evolution for both populations with simple power-law functions and present best-fit parameters for comparison to future theoretical models. Higher-mass quiescent galaxies undergo faster structural evolution, consistent with previous results. Interestingly, star-forming galaxies' sizes and densities evolve at rates similar to those of quiescent galaxies. It is therefore possible that the same physical processes drive the structural evolution of both populations, suggesting that ``dry mergers'' may not be the sole culprit in this size evolution.},

  abstract      = {We present an empirical method of assessing the star formation rate (SFR) of star-forming galaxies based on their locations in the rest-frame color-color diagram (NUV - r) vs. (r - K). By using the Spitzer 24 {$\mu$}m sample in the COSMOS field (\~{}16 400 galaxies with 0.2 {\le} z {\le} 1.3) and a local GALEX-SDSS-SWIRE sample (\~{}700 galaxies with z {\le} 0.2), we show that the mean infrared excess {\mlab}IRX{\mrab} = {\mlab} L$_{IR}$/L$_{UV}$ {\mrab} can be described by a single vector, NRK , that combines the two colors. The calibration between {\mlab}IRX{\mrab} and NRK allows us to recover the IR luminosity, L$_{IR}$, with an accuracy of {$\sigma$} \~{} 0.21 for the COSMOS sample and 0.27 dex for the local one. The SFRs derived with this method agree with the ones based on the observed (UV+IR) luminosities and on the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting for the vast majority (\~{}85\%) of the star-forming population. Thanks to a library of model galaxy SEDs with realistic prescriptions for the star formation history, we show that we need to include a two-component dust model (i.e., birth clouds and diffuse ISM) and a full distribution of galaxy inclinations in order to reproduce the behavior of the {\mlab}IRX{\mrab} stripes in the NUVrK diagram. In conclusion, the NRK method, based only on the rest-frame UV/optical colors available in most of the extragalactic fields, offers a simple alternative of assessing the SFR of star-forming galaxies in the absence of far-IR or spectral diagnostic observations.

The color distribution is well fitted with two Gaussian distributions, which we use to divide the sample into a blue and red population. At fixed luminosity, the mean color of the blue (red) distribution is nearly independent of environment, with a weakly significant (\~{}3 {$\sigma$}) detection of a trend for colors to become redder by 0.1-0.14 (0.03-0.06) mag with a factor of \~{}100 increase in local density, as characterized by the surface density of galaxies within a +/-1000 km s$^{-1}$ redshift slice. In contrast, at fixed luminosity the fraction of galaxies in the red distribution is a strong function of local density, increasing from \~{}10\%-30\% of the population in the lowest density environments to \~{}70\% at the highest densities. The strength of this trend is similar for both the brightest (-23$\lt$M$_{r}$$\lt$-22) and faintest (-19$\lt$M$_{r}$$\lt$-18) galaxies in our sample. The fraction of red galaxies within the virialized regions of clusters shows no significant dependence on velocity dispersion. Even at the lowest densities explored, a substantial population of red galaxies exists, which might be fossil groups. We propose that most star-forming galaxies today evolve at a rate that is determined primarily by their intrinsic properties and independent of their environment. Any environmentally triggered transformations from blue to red colors must occur either on a short timescale or preferentially at high redshift to preserve the simple Gaussian nature of the color distribution. The mechanism must be effective for both bright and faint galaxies.},

We find that the rest-frame color distribution of these galaxies is bimodal at all redshifts out to z\~{}1. This bimodality permits a model-independent definition of red early-type galaxies and blue late-type galaxies at any given redshift. The colors of the blue peak become redder toward the present day, and the number density of blue luminous galaxies has dropped strongly since z\~{}1. Focusing on the red galaxies, we find that they populate a color-magnitude relation. Such red sequences have been identified in galaxy cluster environments, but our data show that such a sequence exists over this redshift range even when averaging over all environments. The mean color of the red galaxy sequence evolves with redshift in a way that is consistent with the aging of an ancient stellar population. The rest-frame B-band luminosity density in red galaxies evolves only mildly with redshift in a {$\Lambda$}-dominated cold dark matter universe. When we account for the change in stellar mass-to-light ratio implied by the redshift evolution in red galaxy colors, the COMBO-17 data indicate an increase in stellar mass on the red sequence by a factor of 2 since z\~{}1. The largest source of uncertainty is large-scale structure, implying that considerably larger surveys are necessary to further refine this result. We explore mechanisms that may drive this evolution in the red galaxy population, finding that both galaxy merging and truncation of star formation in some fraction of the blue star-forming population are required to fully explain the properties of these galaxies.},

The five unique NIR filters of the NMBS enable the precise measurement of photometric redshifts and rest-frame colors for 9900 galaxies at 1 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2.5. The rest-frame U - V color distribution at all z lsim 2.5 is bimodal, with a red peak, a blue peak, and a population of galaxies in between (the green valley). Model fits to the optical-NIR spectral energy distributions and the distribution of MIPS-detected galaxies indicate that the colors of galaxies in the green valley are determined largely by the amount of reddening by dust. This result does not support the simplest interpretation of green valley objects as a transition from blue star forming to red quiescent galaxies. We show that correcting the rest-frame colors for dust reddening allows a remarkably clean separation between the red and blue sequences up to z \~{} 2.5. Our study confirms that dusty-starburst galaxies can contribute a significant fraction to red-sequence samples selected on the basis of a single rest-frame color (i.e., U - V), so extra care must be taken if samples of truly ``red and dead'' galaxies are desired. Interestingly, of galaxies detected at 24 {$\mu$}m, 14\% remain on the red sequence after applying the reddening correction.},

The amount of dust obscuration at UV wavelengths correlates with the FIR-to-blue ratio; and an analysis of the correlation indicates that not only the ionizing but also the nonionizing radiation contribute to the FIR emission. The amount of UV and optical energy lost to dust obscuration accounts for most of the cool dust FIUR emission and for about 70\% of the warm dust FIR emission. The remaining 30\% of the warm dust FIR flux is probably due to dust emission from regions of star formation which are embedded in opaque giant molecular clouds and do not contribute to the integrated UV and optical spectrum. The use of the FIR emission as an indicator of high-mass star formation rate in star-forming galaxies can be problematic, since the contribution to the FIR flux from cool dust emission heated by relatively old stars is nonnegligible.},

  abstract      = {With the goal of investigating the degree to which the MIR emission traces the SFR, we analyze Spitzer 8 and 24 {$\mu$}m data of star-forming regions in a sample of 33 nearby galaxies with available HST NICMOS images in the Pa{$\alpha$} (1.8756 {$\mu$}m) emission line. The galaxies are drawn from the SINGS sample and cover a range of morphologies and a factor \~{}10 in oxygen abundance. Published data on local low-metallicity starburst galaxies and LIRGs are also included in the analysis. Both the stellar continuum-subtracted 8 {$\mu$}m emission and the 24 {$\mu$}m emission correlate with the extinction-corrected Pa{$\alpha$} line emission, although neither relationship is linear. Simple models of stellar populations and dust extinction and emission are able to reproduce the observed nonlinear trend of the 24 {$\mu$}m emission versus number of ionizing photons, including the modest deficiency of 24 {$\mu$}m emission in the low-metallicity regions, which results from a combination of decreasing dust opacity and dust temperature at low luminosities. Conversely, the trend of the 8 {$\mu$}m emission as a function of the number of ionizing photons is not well reproduced by the same models. The 8 {$\mu$}m emission is contributed, in larger measure than the 24 {$\mu$}m emission, by dust heated by nonionizing stellar populations, in addition to the ionizing ones, in agreement with previous findings. Two SFR calibrations, one using the 24 {$\mu$}m emission and the other using a combination of the 24 {$\mu$}m and H{$\alpha$} luminosities (Kennicutt and coworkers), are presented. No calibration is presented for the 8 {$\mu$}m emission because of its significant dependence on both metallicity and environment. The calibrations presented here should be directly applicable to systems dominated by ongoing star formation.

  abstract      = {In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at intermediate redshifts (z {\tilde} 1). We combine the ultra-deep optical spectro-photometric data from the Survey for High-z Absorption Red and Dead Sources (SHARDS) with deep UV-to-FIR observations in the GOODS-N field. Exploiting two of the 25 SHARDS medium-band filters, F687W17 and F823W17, we select [O ii] emission line galaxies at z {\tilde} 0.84 and z {\tilde} 1.23 and characterize their physical properties. Their rest-frame equivalent widths (EW$_{rf}$([O ii])), line fluxes, luminosities, star formation rates (SFRs), and dust attenuation properties are investigated. The evolution of EW$_{rf}$([O ii]) closely follows the SFR density evolution of the universe, with a trend of EW$_{rf}$([O ii]) $\backslash$propto  (1 + z)$^{3}$ up to redshift z {\sime} 1, followed by a possible flattening. The SF properties of the galaxies selected on the basis of their [O ii] emission are compared with complementary samples of SFGs selected by their MIR and FIR emission, and also with a general mass-selected sample of galaxies at the same redshifts. We demonstrate observationally that the UVJ diagram (or, similarly, a cut in the specific SFR) is only partially able to distinguish the quiescent galaxies from the SFGs. The SFR-M$_{*}$ relation is investigated for the different samples, yielding a logarithmic slope {\tilde}1, in good agreement with previous results. The dust attenuations derived from different SFR indicators (UV(1600), UV(2800), [O ii], IR) are compared and show clear trends with respect to both the stellar mass and total SFR, with more massive and highly star-forming galaxies being affected by stronger dust attenuation.},

  abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m$\gt$\~{}1 M$_{solar}$ and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around m$_{c}$\~{}0.08 M$_{solar}$ and a variance in logarithmic mass {$\sigma$}\~{}0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has m$_{c}$\~{}0.2 M$_{solar}$ and {$\sigma$}\~{}0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, n$_{BD}$\~{}n$_{*}$\~{}0.1 pc$^{-3}$. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages $\gt$\~{}130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, m$_{c}$\~{}0.2-0.3 M$_{solar}$, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below \~{}1 M$_{solar}$. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations.  These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv{\'e}nic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.  The page charges for this Review were partially covered by a generous gift from a PASP supporter.},

  abstract      = {We present the first robust measurement of the high redshift mass-metallicity (MZ) relation at 10$^{8}$ $\lt$\~{} M/M $_{⊙}$ $\lt$\~{} 10$^{10}$, obtained by stacking spectra of 83 emission-line galaxies with secure redshifts between 1.3 $\lt$\~{} z $\lt$\~{} 2.3. For these redshifts, infrared grism spectroscopy with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 is sensitive to the R $_{23}$ metallicity diagnostic: ([O II] {$\lambda$}{$\lambda$}3726, 3729 + [O III] {$\lambda$}{$\lambda$}4959, 5007)/H{$\beta$}. Using spectra stacked in four mass quartiles, we find a MZ relation that declines significantly with decreasing mass, extending from 12+log(O/H) = 8.8 at M = 10$^{9.8}$ M $_{⊙}$, to 12+log(O/H) = 8.2 at M = 10$^{8.2}$ M $_{⊙}$. After correcting for systematic offsets between metallicity indicators, we compare our MZ relation to measurements from the stacked spectra of galaxies with M $\gt$\~{} 10$^{9.5}$ M $_{⊙}$ and z \~{} 2.3. Within the statistical uncertainties, our MZ relation agrees with the z \~{} 2.3 result, particularly since our somewhat higher metallicities (by around 0.1 dex) are qualitatively consistent with the lower mean redshift (z = 1.76) of our sample. For the masses probed by our data, the MZ relation shows a steep slope which is suggestive of feedback from energy-driven winds, and a cosmological downsizing evolution where high mass galaxies reach the local MZ relation at earlier times. In addition, we show that our sample falls on an extrapolation of the star-forming main sequence (the SFR-M $_{*}$ relation) at this redshift. This result indicates that grism emission-line selected samples do not have preferentially high star formation rates (SFRs). Finally, we report no evidence for evolution of the mass-metallicity-SFR plane; our stack-averaged measurements show excellent agreement with the local relation.

  abstract = {We describe the goals, design, implementation, and initial progress of the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS), a seven-year sky survey which began in 2005 May. UKIDSS is being carried out using the UKIRT Wide Field Camera (WFCAM), which has the largest {\'e}tendue of any infrared astronomical instrument to date. It is a portfolio of five survey components covering various combinations of the filter set ZYJHK and H$_{2}$. The Large Area Survey, the Galactic Clusters Survey, and the Galactic Plane Survey cover approximately 7000deg$^{2}$ to a depth of K \~{} 18; the Deep Extragalactic Survey covers 35deg$^{2}$ to K \~{} 21, and the Ultra Deep Survey covers 0.77deg$^{2}$ to K \~{} 23. Summed together UKIDSS is 12 times larger in effective volume than the 2MASS survey. The prime aim of UKIDSS is to provide a long-term astronomical legacy data base; the design is, however, driven by a series of specific goals - for example, to find the nearest and faintest substellar objects, to discover Population II brown dwarfs, if they exist, to determine the substellar mass function, to break the z = 7 quasar barrier; to determine the epoch of re-ionization, to measure the growth of structure from z = 3 to the present day, to determine the epoch of spheroid formation, and to map the Milky Way through the dust, to several kpc. The survey data are being uniformly processed. Images and catalogues are being made available through a fully queryable user interface - the WFCAM Science Archive (http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/wsa). The data are being released in stages. The data are immediately public to astronomers in all ESO member states, and available to the world after 18 months. Before the formal survey began, UKIRT and the UKIDSS consortia collaborated in obtaining and analysing a series of small science verification (SV) projects to complete the commissioning of the camera. We show some results from these SV projects in order to demonstrate the likely power of the eventual complete survey. Finally, using the data from the First Data Release, we assess how well UKIDSS is meeting its design targets so far.},

Using new far-infrared photometry from Herschel-PACS and SPIRE and Spitzer-MIPS 24 {$\mu$}m, along with derived infrared luminosities from the NRK method based on galaxies' locations in the restframe color-color diagram (NUV - r) versus (r - K), we are able to more accurately determine total SFRs for our complete sample. At all redshifts, the relationship between median SFR and M $_{*}$ follows a power law at low stellar masses, and flattens to nearly constant SFR at high stellar masses. We describe a new parameterization that provides the best fit to the main sequence and characterizes the low mass power-law slope, turnover mass, and overall scaling. The turnover in the main sequence occurs at a characteristic mass of about M $_{0}$ \~{} 10$^{10}$ M $_{⊙}$ at all redshifts. The low mass power-law slope ranges from 0.9-1.3 and the overall scaling rises in SFR as a function of (1 + z)$^{4.12 ± 0.10}$. A broken power-law fit below and above the turnover mass gives relationships of SFR $\backslash$propto M$_{*}$$^{0.88 +/- 0.06}$ below the turnover mass and SFR $\backslash$propto M$_{*}$$^{0.27 +/- 0.04}$ above the turnover mass. Galaxies more massive than M $_{*}$ $\gt$\~{} 10$^{10}$ M $_{⊙}$ have a much lower average specific star formation rate (sSFR) than would be expected by simply extrapolating the traditional linear fit to the main sequence found for less massive galaxies.},

  abstract = {One of the major challenges to identification of the 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 {$\mu$}m interstellar infrared (IR) emission bands with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules has been the recent detection of these bands in regions with little ultraviolet (UV) illumination, since small, neutral PAH molecules have little or no absorption at visible wavelengths and therefore require UV photons for excitation. We show here that our ``astronomical'' PAH model, incorporating the experimental result that the visual absorption edge shifts to longer wavelength upon ionization and/or as the PAH size increases, can closely reproduce the observed IR emission bands of vdB 133, a UV-poor reflection nebula. We also show that single-photon heating of ``astronomical'' PAHs in reflection nebulae near stars as cool as T$_{eff}$=3000K can result in observable emission at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 {$\mu$}m. Illustrative mid-IR emission spectra are calculated for reflection nebulae illuminated by cool stars with T$_{eff}$=3500, 4500, and 5000 K. These will allow comparison with future Space Infrared Telescope Facility observations of vdB 135 (T$_{eff}$=3600K), vdB 47 (T$_{eff}$=4500K), and vdB 101 (T$_{eff}$=5000K). The dependence on the effective temperature of the exciting star of the observed 12 {$\mu$}m IRAS emission (relative to the total far-IR emission) is consistent with the PAH model for 3000K$\lt$=T$_{eff}$$\lt$=30,000K.},

  abstract      = {This paper uses radial colour profiles to infer the distributions of dust, gas and star formation in z = 0.4-1.4 star-forming main-sequence galaxies. We start with the standard UVJ-based method to estimate dust extinction and specific star formation rate (sSFR). By replacing J with I band, a new calibration method suitable for use with ACS+WFC3 data is created (I.e. UVI diagram). Using a multi-wavelength multi-aperture photometry catalogue based on CANDELS (Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey), UVI colour profiles of 1328 galaxies are stacked in stellar mass and redshift bins. The resulting colour gradients, covering a radial range of 0.2-2.0 effective radii, increase strongly with galaxy mass and with global A$_{V}$. Colour gradient directions are nearly parallel to the Calzetti extinction vector, indicating that dust plays a more important role than stellar population variations. With our calibration, the resulting A$_{V}$ profiles fall much more slowly than stellar mass profiles over the measured radial range. sSFR gradients are nearly flat without central quenching signatures, except for M$_{⋆}$ $\gt$ 10$^{10.5}$ M$_{⊙}$, where central declines of 20-25 per cent are observed. Both sets of profiles agree well with previous radial sSFR and (continuum) A$_{V}$ measurements. They are also consistent with the sSFR profiles and, if assuming a radially constant gas-to-dust ratio, gas profiles in recent hydrodynamic models. We finally discuss the striking findings that SFR scales with stellar mass density in the inner parts of galaxies, and that dust content is high in the outer parts despite low stellar mass surface densities there.},

We utilize a large sample of nearly 6000 groups, selected by fixed cumulative number density from three photometric catalogs, to follow the evolving quiescent fractions of central and satellite galaxies over roughly 11 Gyr. At z \~{} 0, central galaxies in our sample range in stellar mass from Milky Way/M31 analogs (M $_{sstarf}$/M $_{⊙}$ = 6.5 {\times} 10$^{10}$) to nearby massive ellipticals (M $_{sstarf}$/M $_{⊙}$ = 1.5 {\times} 10$^{11}$). Satellite galaxies in the same groups reach masses as low as twice that of the Large Magellanic Cloud (M $_{sstarf}$/M $_{⊙}$ = 6.5 {\times} 10$^{9}$). Using statistical background subtraction, we measure the average rest-frame colors of galaxies in our groups and calculate the evolving quiescent fractions of centrals and satellites over seven redshift bins. Our analysis shows clear evidence for star formation quenching in group halos, with a different quenching onset for centrals and their satellite galaxies. Using halo mass estimates for our central galaxies, we find that star formation shuts off in centrals when typical halo masses reach between 10$^{12}$ and 10$^{13}$ M $_{⊙}$, consistent with predictions from the halo quenching model. In contrast, satellite galaxies in the same groups most likely undergo quenching by environmental processes, whose onset is delayed with respect to their central galaxy. Although star formation is suppressed in all galaxies over time, the processes that govern quenching are different for centrals and satellites. While mass plays an important role in determining the star formation activity of central galaxies, quenching in satellite galaxies is dominated by the environment in which they reside.},

  abstract      = {Using cosmological simulations, we address the properties of high-redshift star-forming galaxies (SFGs) across their main sequence (MS) in the plane of star formation rate (SFR) versus stellar mass. We relate them to the evolution of galaxies through phases of gas compaction, depletion, possible replenishment, and eventual quenching. We find that the high-SFR galaxies in the upper envelope of the MS are compact, with high gas fractions and short depletion times (`blue nuggets'), while the lower SFR galaxies in the lower envelope have lower central gas densities, lower gas fractions, and longer depletion times, consistent with observed gradients across the MS. Stellar-structure gradients are negligible. The SFGs oscillate about the MS ridge on time-scales {\tilde}0.4t$_{Hubble}$ ({\tilde}1 Gyr at z {\tilde} 3). The propagation upwards is due to gas compaction, triggered, e.g. by mergers, counter-rotating streams, and/or violent disc instabilities. The downturn at the upper envelope is due to central gas depletion by peak star formation and outflows while inflow from the shrunken gas disc is suppressed. An upturn at the lower envelope can occur once the extended disc has been replenished by fresh gas and a new compaction can be triggered, namely as long as the replenishment time is shorter than the depletion time. The mechanisms of gas compaction, depletion, and replenishment confine the SFGs to the narrow ({\plusmn}0.3 dex) MS. Full quenching occurs in massive haloes (M$_{vir}$ $\gt$ 10$^{11.5}$ M$_{⊙}$) and/or at low redshifts (z $\lt$ 3), where the replenishment time is long compared to the depletion time, explaining the observed bending down of the MS at the massive end.},

We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (ultraviolet) and SDSS photometry to a library of dust-attenuated population synthesis models. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare remarkably well with those from SDSS-measured emission lines (H{$\alpha$}). Deviations from perfect agreement are shown to be due to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to H{$\alpha$} measurements, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak H{$\alpha$}, and where H{$\alpha$} is contaminated with AGN emission (1/2 of the sample). Using full-SED SFRs, we calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX far- and near-UV magnitudes to produce dust-corrected SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGNs, (2) those hosting an AGN, and (3) galaxies without H{$\alpha$} emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGNs lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Star-forming galaxies without an AGN lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. On the other hand, weak AGNs, while also massive, have lower SFRs, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies via strong and weak AGNs. We confirm that some galaxies with no H{$\alpha$} show signs of star formation in the UV. We derive a cosmic star formation density at z=0.1 with significantly smaller total error than previous measurements.},

A sample is drawn from bulge-dominated Galaxy Evolution Explorer/Sloan Digital Sky Survey (GALEX/SDSS) galaxies on the optical red sequence with strong UV excess and yet quiescent SDSS spectra. High-resolution far-UV imaging of 27 such ETGs using Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys/Solar Blind Channel (ACS/SBC) reveals structured UV morphology in 93\% of the sample, consistent with low-level ongoing SF (\~{}0.5 M $_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$). In 3/4 of the sample the SF is extended on galaxy scales (25-75 kpc), while the rest contains smaller (5-15 kpc) SF patches in the vicinity of an ETG{\mdash}presumably gas-rich satellites being disrupted. Optical imaging reveals that all ETGs with galaxy-scale SF in our sample have old stellar disks (mostly S0 type). None is classified as a true elliptical. In our sample, galaxy-scale SF takes the form of UV rings of varying sizes and morphologies. For the majority of such objects we conclude that the gas needed to fuel current SF has been accreted from the intergalactic medium, probably in a prolonged, quasi-static manner, leading in some cases to additional disk buildup. The remaining ETGs with galaxy-scale SF have UV and optical morphologies consistent with minor merger-driven SF or with the final stages of SF in fading spirals. Our analysis excludes that all recent SF on the red sequence resulted from gas-rich mergers. We find further evidence that galaxy-scale SF is almost exclusively an S0 phenomenon (\~{}20\% S0s have SF) by examining the overall optically red SDSS ETGs. Conclusion is that significant number of field S0s maintain or resume low-level SF because the preventive feedback is not in place or is intermittent. True ellipticals, on the other hand, stay entirely quiescent even in the field.},

  abstract      = {Ultraviolet (UV) nonionizing continuum and mid-infrared (IR) emission constitute the basis of two widely used star formation (SF) indicators at intermediate and high redshifts. We study 2430 galaxies with z $\lt$ 1.4 in the Extended Groth Strip with deep MIPS 24 {$\mu$}m observations from FIDEL, spectroscopy from DEEP2, and UV, optical, and near-IR photometry from the AEGIS. The data are coupled with dust-reddened stellar population models and Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to estimate dust-corrected star formation rates (SFRs). In order to probe the dust heating from stellar populations of various ages, the derived SFRs were averaged over various timescales{\mdash}from 100 Myr for ``current'' SFR (corresponding to young stars) to 1-3 Gyr for long-timescale SFRs (corresponding to the light-weighted age of the dominant stellar populations). These SED-based UV/optical SFRs are compared to total IR luminosities extrapolated from 24 {$\mu$}m observations, corresponding to 10-18 {$\mu$}m rest frame. The total IR luminosities are in the range of normal star-forming galaxies and luminous IR galaxies (10$^{10}$-10$^{12}$ L $_{sun}$). We show that the IR luminosity can be estimated from the UV and optical photometry to within a factor of 2, implying that most z $\lt$ 1.4 galaxies are not optically thick. We find that for the blue, actively star-forming galaxies the correlation between the IR luminosity and the UV/optical SFR shows a decrease in scatter when going from shorter to longer SFR-averaging timescales. We interpret this as the greater role of intermediate age stellar populations in heating the dust than what is typically assumed. Equivalently, we observe that the IR luminosity is better correlated with dust-corrected optical luminosity than with dust-corrected UV light. We find that this holds over the entire redshift range. Many so-called green valley galaxies are simply dust-obscured actively star-forming galaxies. However, there exist 24 {$\mu$}m detected galaxies, some with L $_{IR}$$\gt$10$^{11}$ L $_{sun}$, yet with little current SF. For them a reasonable amount of dust absorption of stellar light (but presumably higher than in nearby early-type galaxies) is sufficient to produce the observed levels of IR, which includes a large contribution from intermediate and old stellar populations. In our sample, which contains very few ultraluminous IR galaxies, optical and X-ray active galactic nuclei do not contribute on average more than \~{}50\% to the mid-IR luminosity, and we see no evidence for a large population of ``IR excess'' galaxies.},

Our method is based on characterizing the SEDs of galaxies as a function of their L(TIR) surface density, which is motivated by the indications that the majority of IR luminous star-forming galaxies at 1 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3 have extended star-forming regions, in contrast to the strongly nuclear concentrated, merger-induced starbursts in local luminous and ultraluminous IR galaxies. We validate our procedure for estimating L(TIR) by comparing the resulting L(TIR) with those measured from far-IR observations, such as those from Herschel in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDFS) and Hubble Deep Field North (HDFN), as well as L(TIR) measured from stacked far-IR observations at redshift 0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2.8. Active galactic nuclei were excluded using X-ray and 3.6-8.0 {$\mu$}m observations, which are generally available in deep cosmological survey fields. The Gaussian fits to the distribution of the discrepancies between the L(TIR) measurements from single-band 24 {$\mu$}m and Herschel observations in the ECDFS and HDFN samples have {$\sigma$} $\lt$ 0.1 dex, with \~{}10\% of objects disagreeing by more than 0.2 dex. Since the 24 {$\mu$}m estimates are based on SEDs for extended galaxies, this agreement suggests that \~{}90\% of IR galaxies at high z are indeed much more physically extended than local counterparts of similar L(TIR), consistent with recent independent studies of the fractions of galaxies forming stars in the main-sequence and starburst modes, respectively. Because we have not introduced empirical corrections to enhance these estimates, in principle, our method should be applicable to lower luminosity galaxies. This will enable use of the 21 {$\mu$}m band of the Mid-Infrared Instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope to provide an extremely sensitive tracer of obscured SFR in individual star-forming galaxies across the peak of the cosmic star formation history.},

More noticeably, \~{}60\% of all compact massive galaxies at z = 1-2 are detected at 24 {$\mu$}m, even when rest-frame optical colors reveal that they are dead and evolving passively. For spheroid-like galaxies at a given stellar mass, the sizes of MIPS nondetections are smaller by a factor of \~{}1.2 in comparison with IR-bright sources. We find that disklike massive galaxies present specific SFRs ranging from 0.04 to 0.2 Gyr$^{-1}$ at z $\lt$ 1 (SFRs ranging from 1 to 10 M$_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$), typically a factor of 3-6 higher than massive spheroid-like objects in the same redshift range.

Galaxies with 10$^{11.5}$ $\lt$ M $\lt$ 10$^{12.0}$ M$_{⊙}$ assembled half of their stellar mass before z \~{} 1.5, and more than 90\% of their mass was already in place at z \~{} 0.6. Galaxies with M $\lt$ 10$^{11.5}$ M$_{⊙}$ evolved more slowly (presenting smaller specific SFRs), assembling half of their stellar mass below z \~{} 1. About 40\% of the local stellar mass density of 10$^{9.0}$ $\lt$ M $\lt$ 10$^{11.0}$ M$_{⊙}$ galaxies was assembled below z \~{} 0.4, most probably through accretion of small satellites producing little star formation. The cosmic stellar mass density at z $\gt$ 2.5 is dominated by optically faint (Rgtrsim 25) red galaxies (distant red galaxies or BzK sources), which account for \~{}30\% of the global population of galaxies, but contribute at least 60\% of the cosmic stellar mass density. Bluer galaxies (e.g., Lyman break galaxies) are more numerous but less massive, contributing less than 50\% of the global stellar mass density at high redshift.},

  abstract      = {Due to significant galaxy contamination and impurity in stellar mass selected samples (up to 95 per cent from z = 0-3), we examine the star formation history, quenching time-scales, and structural evolution of galaxies using a constant number density selection with data from the United Kingdom Infra-Red Deep Sky Survey Ultra-Deep Survey field. Using this methodology, we investigate the evolution of galaxies at a variety of number densities from z = 0-3. We find that samples chosen at number densities ranging from 3 {\times} 10$^{-4}$ to 10$^{-5}$ galaxies Mpc$^{-3}$ (corresponding to z {\tilde} 0.5 stellar masses of M$_{*}$ = 10$^{10.95-11.6}$ M$_{0}$) have a star-forming blue fraction of {\tilde}50 per cent at z {\tilde} 2.5, which evolves to a nearly 100 per cent quenched red and dead population by z {\tilde} 1. We also see evidence for number density downsizing, such that the galaxies selected at the lowest densities (highest masses) become a homogeneous red population before those at higher number densities. Examining the evolution of the colours for these systems furthermore shows that the formation redshift of galaxies selected at these number densities is z$_{form}$ $\gt$ 3. The structural evolution through size and S{\'e}rsic index fits reveal that while there remains evolution in terms of galaxies becoming larger and more concentrated in stellar mass at lower redshifts, the magnitude of the change is significantly smaller than for a mass-selected sample. We also find that changes in size and structure continues at z $\lt$ 1, and is coupled strongly to passivity evolution. We conclude that galaxy structure is driving the quenching of galaxies, such that galaxies become concentrated before they become passive.},

The data indicate that the high specific SF rates (SFRs) of many less massive galaxies do not represent late, irregular or recurrent, starbursts in evolved galaxies. They rather seem to reflect the onset (initial burst) of the dominant SF episode of galaxies, after which SF gradually declines on gigayear timescales to z=0 and forms the bulk of a galaxy's M$_{*}$. With decreasing mass, this onset of major SF shifts to decreasing z for an increasing fraction of galaxies (staged galaxy formation). This process may be an important component of the ``downsizing'' phenomenon. We find that the predominantly gradual decline of SFRs described by Noeske et al. can be reproduced by exponential SF histories ({$\tau$} models), if less massive galaxies have systematically longer e-folding times {$\tau$}, and a later onset of SF (z$_{f}$). Our model can provide a first parameterization of SFR as a function of M$_{*}$ and z, and quantify mass dependences of {$\tau$} and z$_{f}$, from direct observations of M$_{*}$ and SFRs up to z$\gt$1. The observed evolution of SF in galaxies can plausibly reflect the dominance of gradual gas exhaustion. The data are also consistent with the history of cosmological accretion onto dark matter halos.},

We propose a simple technique for constraining this mass flux using the volume-corrected number density in the extinction-corrected UV-optical color-magnitude distribution, the stellar age indexes H δ A and D n (4000) , and a simple prescription for spectral evolution using a quenched star formation history. We exploit the excellent separation of red and blue sequences in the NUV − r band Hess function. The final value we measure, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/dotrho.gif] {dot rho} T = 0.033 M ☉ yr −1 Mpc −3 , is strictly speaking an upper limit due to the possible contributions of bursting, composite, and extincted galaxies.

  abstract    = {We present the results of our automatic search for proximate damped Ly$\alpha$ absorption (PDLA) systems in the quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 12. We constrain our search to those PDLAs lying within 1500 km s$^{-1}$ from the quasar to make sure that the broad DLA absorption trough masks most of the strong Ly$\alpha$ emission from the broad line region (BLR) of the quasar. When the Ly$\alpha$ emission from the BLR is blocked by these so-called eclipsing DLAs, narrow Ly$\alpha$ emission from the host galaxy could be revealed as a narrow emission line (NEL) in the DLA trough. We define a statistical sample of 399 eclipsing DLAs with log$N$(HI)$\ge$21.10. We divide our statistical sample into three subsamples based on the strength of the NEL detected in the DLA trough. By studying the stacked spectra of these subsamples, we found that absorption from high ionization species are stronger in DLAs with stronger NEL in their absorption core. Moreover, absorption from the excited states of species like SiII are also stronger in DLAs with stronger NEL. We also found no correlation between the luminosity of the Ly$\alpha$ NEL and the quasar luminosity. These observations are consistent with a scenario in which the DLAs with stronger NEL are denser and physically closer to the quasar. We propose that these eclipsing DLAs could be the product of the interaction between infalling and outflowing gas. High resolution spectroscopic observation would be needed to shed some light on the nature of these eclipsing DLAs.},

  abstract    = {Continuum emissions from dust grains are used as a general probe to constrain the initial physical conditions of molecular dense cores where new stars may born. To get as much information as possible from dust emissions, we have developed a tool, named as $COREGA$, which is capable of identifying positions of dense cores, optimizing a three-dimensional model for the dense cores with well characterized uncertainties. $COREGA$ can also estimate the physical properties of dense cores, such as density, temperature, and dust emissivity, through analyzing multi-wavelength dust continuum data sets. In the numerical tests on $COREGA$, the results of fitting simulated data are consistent with initial built-in parameters. We also demonstrate $COREGA$ by adding random gaussian noises with Monte Carlo methods and show that the results are stable against varying observational noise intensities within certain levels. A beam size $<$ 3 arcsec and rms $<$ 0.2mJy/pixel (1 pixel = 0.1") is needed for ALMA to distinguish different collapse models, such as power law and Bonner-Ebert sphere, during continuum observations of massive dense cores in Orion molecular cloud. Based on its advanced algorithm, $COREGA$ is capable of giving a quick and deep analysis on dust cores.},

The velocity fields of our sources, traced by the $^{12}$CO($J$=3-2) emission, are consistent with disk rotation to first order, implying average dynamical masses of $\sim$3$\times10^{11}$M$_{\odot}$ within two half-light radii. Through a Bayesian approach we investigate the uncertainties inherent to dynamically constraining total gas masses. We explore the covariance between the stellar mass-to-light ratio and CO-to-H$_{2}$ conversion factor, $\alpha_{\rm CO}$, finding values of $\alpha_{\rm CO}=1.1^{+0.8}_{-0.7}$ for dark matter fractions of 15 \%. We show that the resolved spatial distribution of the gas and dust continuum can be uncorrelated to the stellar emission, challenging energy balance assumptions in global SED fitting. Through a stacking analysis of the resolved radial profiles of the CO(3-2), stellar and dust continuum emission in SMG samples, we find that the cool molecular gas emission in these sources (radii $\sim$5--14 kpc) is clearly more extended than the rest-frame $\sim$250 $\mu$m dust continuum by a factor $>2$. We propose that assuming a constant dust-to-gas ratio, this apparent difference in sizes can be explained by temperature and optical-depth gradients alone. Our results suggest that caution must be exercised when extrapolating morphological properties of dust continuum observations to conclusions about the molecular gas phase of the ISM.},

  abstract    = {Over 80% of the cosmic baryon density is likely to be distributed in the diffuse, $\gtrsim10^{4}$ K circum- and inter-galactic medium (CGM and IGM respectively). We demonstrate that the dispersion measures (DMs) of samples of localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) can be used to measure the distribution of baryons between the CGM and IGM. We propose to separate the CGM and IGM contributions to FRB DMs by including redshift and mass measurements of intervening galaxies. Using simulated samples of FRB sightlines through intervening galaxy halos and an illustrative model for the CGM, and including realistic observational uncertainties, we show that small samples ($O(10^{1})-O(10^{2})$) of localized FRBs are sensitive to the presence of CGM gas. The fractions of baryons in the CGM and IGM can be accurately estimated with 100 FRBs at $z<1$, and the characteristic radial density profiles of CGM halos may also be possible to constrain. The required samples of localized FRBs are expected to be assembled in the coming few years by instruments such as the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, the Very Large Array, and the Deep Synoptic Array.},

We detect 76 runaway stars, 17 (possibly 19) of them with no prior identification as such, with an estimated detection rate of approximately one half of the real runaway fraction. An age effect appears to be present, with objects of spectral subtype B1 and later having travelled for longer distances than runaways of earlier subtypes. We also tentatively propose that the fraction of runaways is lower among BA supergiants that among O stars but further studies using future Gaia data releases are needed to confirm this. The frequency of fast rotators is high among runaway O stars, which indicates that a significant fraction of them (and possibly a majority) is produced in supernova explosions.},

  abstract    = {The light curves of Type IIn supernovae are dominated by the radiative energy released through the interaction of the supernova shockwaves with their dense circumstellar medium (CSM). The ultraluminous Type IIn supernova SN 2010jl exhibits an infrared emission component that is in excess of the extrapolated UV-optical spectrum as early as a few weeks post-explosion. This emission has been attributed by some as evidence for rapid formation of dust in the cooling postshock CSM. We investigate the physical processes that may inhibit or facilitate the formation of dust in the CSM. When only radiative cooling is considered, the temperature of the dense shocked gas rapidly drops below the dust condensation temperature. However, by accounting for the heating of the postshock gas by the downstream radiation from the shock, we show that dust formation is inhibited until the radiation from the shock weakens, as the shock propagates into the less dense outer regions of the CSM. In SN 2010jl dust formation can therefore only commence after day 380. Only the IR emission since that epoch can be attributed to the newly formed CSM dust. Observations on day 460 and later show that the IR luminosity exceeds the UV-optical luminosity. The post-shock dust cannot extinct the radiation emitted by the expanding SN shock. Therefore, its IR emission must be powered by an interior source, which we identify with the reverse shock propagating through the SN ejecta. IR emission before day 380 must therefore be an IR echo from preexisting CSM dust.},

Comparing with spectroscopic redshifts indicates a photometric redshift uncertainty σ z = 0.010, 0.009, and 0.011 in CDFS, COSMOS, and UDS. As spectroscopic samples are often biased toward bright and blue sources, we also inspect the photometric redshift differences between close pairs of galaxies, finding σ z ,pairs  = 0.01–0.02 at1 < z < 2.5. We quantify how σ z ,pairs depends on redshift, magnitude, spectral energy distribution type, and the inclusion of FourStar medium bands. σ z ,pairs is smallest for bright, blue star-forming samples, while red star-forming galaxies have the worst σ z ,pairs .

Our basic methodology is similar in principle but different in detail from previous procedures for crowded field photometry. We use the spatial positions and morphologies of objects in an image with higher angular resolution to construct object templates, which are then fitted to a lower resolution image, solving for the object fluxes as free parameters. Using extensive experiments on both simulated and real data, we show that this template‐fitting method measures accurate object photometry to the limiting sensitivity of the image. In this limit, our method derives robust flux upper limits for objects fainter than the limiting image surface brightness. We describe the challenges encountered in applying this technique to real data, and methods to cope with some of them.},

  abstract = {We present a two-dimensional fitting algorithm (GALFIT) designed to extract structural components from galaxy images, with emphasis on closely modeling light profiles of spatially well-resolved, nearby galaxies observed with the Hubble Space Telescope . Our algorithm improves on previous techniques in two areas: by being able to simultaneously fit a galaxy with an arbitrary number of components and with optimization in computation speed, suited for working on large galaxy images. We use two-dimensional models such as the "Nuker" law, the Sérsic (de Vaucouleurs) profile, an exponential disk, and Gaussian or Moffat functions. The azimuthal shapes are generalized ellipses that can fit disky and boxy components. Some potential applications of our program include: standard modeling of global galaxy profiles; extracting bars, stellar disks, double nuclei, and compact nuclear sources; and measuring absolute dust extinction or surface brightness fluctuations after removing the galaxy model. When examined in detail, we find that even simple looking galaxies generally require at least three components to be modeled accurately, rather than the one or two components more often employed. Many galaxies with complex isophotes, ellipticity changes, and position angle twists can be modeled accurately in two dimensions. We illustrate this by way of 11 case studies, which include regular and barred spiral galaxies, highly disky lenticular galaxies, and elliptical galaxies displaying various levels of complexities. A useful extension of this algorithm is to accurately extract nuclear point sources in galaxies. We compare two-dimensional and one-dimensional extraction techniques on simulated images of galaxies having nuclear slopes with different degrees of cuspiness, and we then illustrate the application of the program to several examples of nearby galaxies with weak nuclei.},

The accuracy of these redshifts is better than 10% for 80% of the sample.

Our results constrain the density and/or luminosity evolution of infrared-bright star-forming galaxies. The typical infrared luminosity ( L *) decreases by an order of magnitude from z ~ 2 to the present. The cosmic star formation rate (SFR) density goes as (1 + z ) 4.0±0.2 from z = 0 to 0.8.

We utilize a large sample of nearly 6000 groups, selected by fixed cumulative number density from three photometric catalogs, to follow the evolving quiescent fractions of central and satellite galaxies over roughly 11 Gyr. At z ~ 0, central galaxies in our sample range in stellar mass from Milky Way/M31 analogs ( M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sstarf.gif] {sstarf} / M ☉ = 6.5 × 10 10 ) to nearby massive ellipticals ( M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sstarf.gif] {sstarf} / M ☉ = 1.5 × 10 11 ).

Using statistical background subtraction, we measure the average rest-frame colors of galaxies in our groups and calculate the evolving quiescent fractions of centrals and satellites over seven redshift bins. Our analysis shows clear evidence for star formation quenching in group halos, with a different quenching onset for centrals and their satellite galaxies. Using halo mass estimates for our central galaxies, we find that star formation shuts off in centrals when typical halo masses reach between 10 12 and 10 13 M ☉ , consistent with predictions from the halo quenching model. In contrast, satellite galaxies in the same groups most likely undergo quenching by environmental processes, whose onset is delayed with respect to their central galaxy. Although star formation is suppressed in all galaxies over time, the processes that govern quenching are different for centrals and satellites. While mass plays an important role in determining the star formation activity of central galaxies, quenching in satellite galaxies is dominated by the environment in which they reside.},

The data indicate that the high specific SF rates (SFRs) of many less massive galaxies do not represent late, irregular or recurrent, starbursts in evolved galaxies. They rather seem to reflect the onset (initial burst) of the dominant SF episode of galaxies, after which SF gradually declines on gigayear timescales to z = 0 and forms the bulk of a galaxy's M * . With decreasing mass, this onset of major SF shifts to decreasing z for an increasing fraction of galaxies ( staged galaxy formation ). This process may be an important component of the "downsizing" phenomenon. We find that the predominantly gradual decline of SFRs described by Noeske et al. can be reproduced by exponential SF histories ( τ models ), if less massive galaxies have systematically longer e -folding times τ, and a later onset of SF ( z f ). Our model can provide a first parameterization of SFR as a function of M * and z , and quantify mass dependences of τ and z f , from direct observations of M * and SFRs up to z > 1. The observed evolution of SF in galaxies can plausibly reflect the dominance of gradual gas exhaustion. The data are also consistent with the history of cosmological accretion onto dark matter halos.},

Here, we model the spectral energy distributions of galaxies at z ∼ 1.5–3 from CANDELS with rest-frame UV to near-IR imaging under different assumptions about the dust law, and compare the amount of inferred attenuated light with the observed infrared (IR) luminosities. Some individual galaxies show strong Bayesian evidence in preference of one dust law over another, and this preference agrees with their observed location on the plane of infrared excess (IRX, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/827/1/20/apjaa2a65ieqn1.gif] {${L}_{\mathrm{TIR}}$} / ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/827/1/20/apjaa2a65ieqn2.gif] {${L}_{\mathrm{UV}}$} ) and UV slope ( β ).

Galaxies with high color excess have a shallower, starburst-like law, and those with low color excess have a steeper, SMC-like law. Surprisingly, the galaxies in our sample show no correlation between the shape of the dust law and stellar mass, star formation rate, or β . The change in the dust law with color excess is consistent with a model where attenuation is caused by scattering, a mixed star–dust geometry, and/or trends with stellar population age, metallicity, and dust grain size. This rest-frame UV-to-near-IR method shows potential to constrain the dust law at even higher redshifts ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/827/1/20/apjaa2a65ieqn6.gif] {$z\gt 3$} ).},

  abstract = {This Letter utilizes composite spectral energy distributions (SEDs) constructed from NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey photometry to constrain the dust attenuation curve in 0.5 < z < 2.0 galaxies. Based on similarities between the full SED shapes (0.3-8 μm), we have divided galaxies in 32 different spectral classes and stacked their photometry. As each class contains galaxies over a range in redshift, the resulting rest-frame SEDs are well sampled in wavelength and show various spectral features including Hα and the UV dust bump at 2175 Å. We fit all composite SEDs with flexible stellar population synthesis models, while exploring attenuation curves with varying slopes and UV bump strengths. The Milky Way and Calzetti law provide poor fits at UV wavelengths for nearly all SEDs. Consistent with previous studies, we find that the best-fit attenuation law varies with spectral type. There is a strong correlation between the best-fit dust slope and UV bump strength, with steeper laws having stronger bumps. Moreover, the attenuation curve correlates with specific star formation rate (SFR), with more active galaxies having shallower dust curves and weaker bumps. There is also a weak correlation with inclination. The observed trends can be explained by differences in the dust-to-star geometry, a varying grain size distribution, or a combination of both. Our results have several implications for galaxy evolution studies. First, the assumption of a universal dust model leads to biases in derived galaxy properties. Second, the presence of a dust bump may result in underestimated values for the UV slope, used to correct SFRs of distant galaxies.},

The 393 objects observed cover a 26.2 arcmin\^{}2\^{} area and constitute a nearly complete sample down to K = 20, I = 23, and B = 24.5. The rest-frame K- band luminosity function and its evolution with redshift are described. Comparisons are made with other optically selected (B and I) samples in the literature, and the corresponding rest-frame B-band luminosity function evolution is presented. The B-band counts at B \~{} 24 are shown to be a mixture of normal galaxies at modest redshifts and galaxies undergoing rapid star formation, which have a wide range of masses and which are spread over the redshift interval from z = 0.2 to beyond z = 1.7. The luminosity functions, number counts, and color distributions at optical and IR wavelengths are discussed in terms of a consistent picture of the star-forming history of the galaxy sample. [O II] emission-line diagnostics or rest-frame ultraviolet-infrared color information are used in combination with rest-frame absolute H magnitudes to construct a ``fundamental plane'' in which the evolution of the global star-formation rate with redshift can be shown, and we find that the maximum rest-frame K luminosity of galaxies undergoing rapid star formation has been declining smoothly with decreasing redshift from a value near L\_*\_ at z $\gt$ 1. This smooth decrease in the characteristic luminosity of galaxies dominated by star formation can simultaneously account for the high B- band galaxy counts at faint magnitudes and the redshift distribution at z $\lt$ 1 in both the B- and K-selected samples. Finally, the overall K-band light density evolution is discussed as a tracer of the baryonic mass in stars and compared with the overall rates of star formation inferred from the rest-frame ultraviolet light density as a function of redshift.},

  abstract = {We study the star formation rates (SFRs) of galaxies as a function of local galaxy density at 0.6 < z < 0.9. We used a low-dispersion prism in IMACS on the 6.5 m Baade (Magellan I) telescope to obtain spectra and measured redshifts to a precision of σ z /(1 + z ) ~ 1% for galaxies with z AB < 23.3 mag. We utilized a stellar mass-limited sample of 977 galaxies above M > 1.8 × 10 10 M ☉ (log M / M ☉ >10.25) to conduct our main analysis. With three different SFR indicators, (1) Spitzer MIPS 24 μm imaging, (2) spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, and (3) [O II ]λ3727 emission, we find the median specific SFR (SSFR) and SFR to decline from the low-density field to the cores of groups and a rich cluster. For the SED- and [O II ]-based SFRs, the decline in SSFR is roughly an order of magnitude while for the MIPS-based SFRs, the decline is a factor of ~4. We find approximately the same magnitude of decline in SSFR even after removing the sample of galaxies near the cluster. Galaxies in groups and a cluster at these redshifts therefore have lower star formation (SF) activity than galaxies in the field, as is the case at z ~ 0. We investigated whether the decline in SFR with increasing density is caused by a change in the proportion of quiescent and star-forming galaxies (SFGs) or by a decline in the SFRs of SFGs. Using the rest-frame U – V and V – J colors to distinguish quiescent galaxies from SFGs (including both unattenuated blue galaxies and reddened ones), we find that the fraction of quiescent galaxies increases from ~32% to 79% from low to high density. In addition, we find the SSFRs of SFGs, selected based on U – V and V – J colors, to decline with increasing density by factors of ~5-6 for the SED- and [O II ]-based SFRs. The MIPS-based SSFRs for SFGs decline with a shallower slope. The declining SFRs of SFGs with density are paralleled by a decline in the median A V , providing indirect evidence that the cold gas content that fuels future SF is diminished in higher density environments. The order of magnitude decline in the SSFR-density relation at 0.6 < z < 0.9 is therefore driven by both a combination of declining SFRs of SFGs as well as a changing mix of SFGs and quiescent galaxies.},

The use of the UVJ diagram as a tool to distinguish quiescent galaxies from star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is becoming more common due to its ability to separate red quiescent galaxies from reddened SFGs. Quiescent galaxies occupy a small and distinct region of UVJ color space and we find most of them to have concentrated profiles with high Sérsic indices ( n > 2.5) and smooth structure characteristic of early-type systems. SFGs populate a broad but well-defined sequence of UVJ colors and are comprised of objects with a mix of Sérsic indices. Interestingly, most UVJ -selected SFGs with high Sérsic indices also display structure due to dust and star formation typical of the n < 2.5 SFGs and late-type systems. Finally, we find that the position of an SFG on the sequence of UVJ colors is determined to a large degree by the mass of the galaxy and its inclination. Systems that are closer to edge-on generally display redder colors and lower [O II ]λ3727 luminosity per unit mass as a consequence of the reddening due to dust within the disks. We conclude that the two main features seen in UVJ color space correspond closely to the traditional morphological classes of early- and late-type galaxies.},

We determine stellar masses by fitting the spectral energy distribution inferred from photometry with current stellar population synthesis models. This work raises the number of galaxies with metallicities at z ~0.8 by more than an order of magnitude. We investigate the evolution in the MZ and LZ relations in comparison with local MZ and LZ relations determined in a consistent manner using ~21, 000 galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We show that high stellar mass galaxies ( M ~ 10 10.6 M ☉ ) at z ~0.8 have attained the chemical enrichment seen in the local universe, while lower stellar mass galaxies ( M ~ 10 9.2 M ☉ ) at z ~0.8 have lower metallicities (Δlog(O/H) ~ 0.15 dex) than galaxies at the same stellar mass in the local universe. We find that the LZ relation evolves in both metallicity and B -band luminosity between z ~0.8 and z ~ 0, with the B -band luminosity evolving as a function of stellar mass. We emphasize that the B -band luminosity should not be used as a proxy for stellar mass in chemical evolution studies of star-forming galaxies. Our study shows that both the metallicity evolution and the B -band luminosity evolution for emission-line galaxies between the epochs are a function of stellar mass, consistent with the cosmic downsizing scenario of galaxy evolution.},

We show that the relation between dust extinction and SFR changes with stellar mass. For galaxies at the same stellar mass, dust extinction is anti- correlated with the SFR at stellar masses <10 10 M ☉ . There is a sharp transition in the relation at a stellar mass of 10 10 M ☉ . At larger stellar masses, dust extinction is positively correlated with the SFR for galaxies at the same stellar mass. The observed relation between stellar mass, dust extinction, and SFR presented in this study helps to confirm similar trends observed in the relation between stellar mass, metallicity, and SFR. The relation reported in this study provides important new constraints on the physical processes governing the chemical evolution of galaxies. The correlation between SFR and dust extinction for galaxies with stellar masses >10 10 M ☉ is shown to extend to the population of quiescent galaxies suggesting that the physical processes responsible for the observed relation between stellar mass, dust extinction, and SFR may be related to the processes leading to the shutdown of star formation in galaxies.},

  abstract = {We present abundance measurements from 26 emission-line-selected galaxies at z ~ 0.6-0.7. By reaching stellar masses as low as 10 8 M ☉ , these observations provide the first measurement of the intermediate-redshift mass-metallicity (MZ) relation below 10 9 M ☉ . For the portion of our sample above M > 10 9 M ☉ (8/26 galaxies), we find good agreement with previous measurements of the intermediate-redshift MZ relation. Compared to the local relation, we measure an evolution that corresponds to a 0.12 dex decrease in oxygen abundances at intermediate redshifts. This result confirms the trend that metallicity evolution becomes more significant toward lower stellar masses, in keeping with a downsizing scenario where low-mass galaxies evolve onto the local MZ relation at later cosmic times. We show that these galaxies follow the local fundamental metallicity relation, where objects with higher specific (mass-normalized) star formation rates (SFRs) have lower metallicities. Furthermore, we show that the galaxies in our sample lie on an extrapolation of the SFR- M * relation (the star-forming main sequence). Leveraging the MZ relation and star-forming main sequence (and combining our data with higher-mass measurements from the literature), we test models that assume an equilibrium between mass inflow, outflow, and star formation. We find that outflows are required to describe the data. By comparing different outflow prescriptions, we show that momentum, driven winds can describe the MZ relation; however, this model underpredicts the amount of star formation in low-mass galaxies. This disagreement may indicate that preventive feedback from gas heating has been overestimated, or it may signify a more fundamental deviation from the equilibrium assumption.},

We use an initial sample of 87 star-forming galaxies with spectroscopic coverage of Hβ, [O III ] λ5007, Hα, and [N II ] λ6584 rest-frame optical emission lines, and estimate the gas-phase oxygen abundance based on the N2 and O3N2 strong-line indicators. We find a positive correlation between stellar mass and metallicity among individual z ~ 2.3 galaxies using both the N2 and O3N2 indicators. We also measure the emission-line ratios and corresponding oxygen abundances for composite spectra in bins of stellar mass. Among composite spectra, we find a monotonic increase in metallicity with increasing stellar mass, offset ~0.15-0.3 dex below the local MZR. When the sample is divided at the median star-formation rate (SFR), we do not observe significant SFR dependence of the z ~ 2.3 MZR among either individual galaxies or composite spectra. We furthermore find that z ~ 2.3 galaxies have metallicities ~0.1 dex lower at a given stellar mass and SFR than is observed locally. This offset suggests that high-redshift galaxies do not fall on the local "fundamental metallicity relation" among stellar mass, metallicity, and SFR, and may provide evidence of a phase of galaxy growth in which the gas reservoir is built up due to inflow rates that are higher than star-formation and outflow rates. However, robust conclusions regarding the gas-phase oxygen abundances of high-redshift galaxies await a systematic reappraisal of the application of locally calibrated metallicity indicators at high redshift.},

Dedicated experimental studies have provided critical input for detailed astronomical models that probe the origin and evolution of interstellar PAHs and their role in the universe. The physics and chemistry of PAHs are discussed, emphasizing the contribution of these species to the photoelectric heating and the ionization balance of the interstellar gas and to the formation of small hydrocarbon radicals and carbon chains.

Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic “dark ages” to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z≈1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25\% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25\% formed after z = 0.7. Less than ∼1\% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization. },

  abstract = { Numerical simulations have become a major tool for understanding galaxy formation and evolution. Over the decades the field has made significant progress. It is now possible to simulate the formation of individual galaxies and galaxy populations from well-defined initial conditions with realistic abundances and global properties. An essential component of the calculation is to correctly estimate the inflow to and outflow from forming galaxies because observations indicating low formation efficiency and strong circumgalactic presence of gas are persuasive. Energetic “feedback” from massive stars and accreting supermassive black holes—generally unresolved in cosmological simulations—plays a major role in driving galactic outflows, which have been shown to regulate many aspects of galaxy evolution. A surprisingly large variety of plausible subresolution models succeeds in this exercise. They capture the essential characteristics of the problem, i.e., outflows regulating galactic gas flows, but their predictive power is limited. In this review, we focus on one major challenge for galaxy formation theory: to understand the underlying physical processes that regulate the structure of the interstellar medium, star formation, and the driving of galactic outflows. This requires accurate physical models and numerical simulations, which can precisely describe the multiphase structure of the interstellar medium on the currently unresolved few hundred parsec scales of large-scale cosmological simulations. Such models ultimately require the full accounting for the dominant cooling and heating processes, the radiation and winds from massive stars and accreting black holes, and an accurate treatment of supernova explosions as well as the nonthermal components of the interstellar medium like magnetic fields and cosmic rays. },

  abstract = { In the past five years, deep imaging campaigns conducted with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and ground-based observatories have delivered large samples of galaxies at 6.5<z<10, providing our first glimpse of the census of star formation activity in what is thought to be the heart of the reionization era. The space density of luminous galaxies has been shown to decrease by 15–20× over 4<z<8. Over this same redshift interval, the faint-end slope of the UV luminosity function becomes steeper (α≃−2.0 at z≃7−8), revealing a dominant population of low-luminosity galaxies. Analysis of multiwavelength imaging from HST and the Spitzer Space Telescope demonstrates that z>6 UV-selected galaxies are relatively compact with blue UV continuum slopes, low stellar masses, and large specific star formation rates. In the last year, ALMA (the Atacama Large Millimeter Array) and ground-based infrared spectrographs have begun to complement this picture, revealing minimal dust obscuration and hard radiation fields, and providing evidence for metal-poor ionized gas. Weak low-ionization absorption lines suggest a patchy distribution of neutral gas surrounds O and B stars, possibly aiding in the escape of ionizing radiation. Gamma ray burst afterglows and Lyman-α surveys have provided evidence that the intergalactic medium (IGM) evolves from mostly ionized at z≃6−6.5 to considerably neutral at z≃7−8 . The reionization history that emerges from considering the UV output of galaxies over 6<z<10 is consistent with these constraints on the IGM ionization state. The latest measurements suggest that galaxies can complete reionization by z≃6 and reproduce the Thomson scattering optical depth faced by cosmic microwave background photons if the luminosity function extends ≃4 mag below current surveys and a moderate fraction of ionizing radiation escapes from galaxies. },

  abstract = {We have used near-ultraviolet (NUV) to mid-infrared (MIR) composite spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to simultaneously model the attenuated stellar and dust emission of 0.5 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 2.0 galaxies. These composite SEDs were previously constructed from the photometric catalogs of the NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey by stacking the observed photometry of galaxies that have similar rest-frame NUV-to-NIR SEDs. In this work, we include a stacked MIPS 24 μm measurement for each SED type to extend the SEDs to rest-frame MIR wavelengths. Consistent with previous studies, the observed MIR emission for most SED types is higher than expected from only the attenuated stellar emission. We fit the NUV-to-MIR composite SEDs with the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis (FSPS) models, which include both stellar and dust emission. We compare the best-fit star formation rates (SFRs) to the SFRs based on simple UV+IR estimators. Interestingly, the UV and IR luminosities overestimate SFRs—compared to the model SFRs—by more than ~1 dex for quiescent galaxies, while for the highest star-forming galaxies in our sample the two SFRs are broadly consistent. The difference in specific SFRs also shows a gradually increasing trend with declining specific SFR, implying that quiescent galaxies have even lower specific SFRs than previously found. Contributions from evolved stellar populations to both the UV and the MIR SEDs most likely explain the discrepancy. Based on this work, we conclude that SFRs should be determined from modeling the attenuated stellar and dust emission simultaneously, instead of employing simple UV+IR-based SFR estimators.},

The radial trends of D4000, W 0 (Hδ), and W 0 (O ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/527/1/54/img1.gif] {img1.gif} ) are all consistent with an age sequence, in the sense that the last episode of star formation occurred more recently in galaxies farthest from the cluster center. Throughout the cluster environment, galaxies show evidence for older stellar populations than field galaxies; they have weaker W 0 (O ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/527/1/54/img1.gif] {img1.gif} ) and W 0 (Hδ) lines and stronger D4000 indexes. From our primary sample of 1413 galaxies, statistically corrected for incompleteness and selection effects, we identify a sample of K+A galaxies, which have strong Hδ absorption lines [ W 0 (Hδ) > 5 Å] but no [O II ] emission [ W 0 (O ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/527/1/54/img1.gif] {img1.gif} ) < 5 Å], perhaps indicative of recently terminated star formation. The observed fraction of 4.4% ± 0.7% in the cluster sample is an overestimate due to a systematic effect that results from the large uncertainties on individual spectral index measurements. Corrected for this bias, we estimate that K+A galaxies make up only 2.1% ± 0.7% of the cluster sample and 0.1% ± 0.7% of the field. From the subsample of galaxies more luminous than M r = -18.8 + 5 log h , which is statistically representative of a complete sample to this limit, the corrected fraction of K+A galaxies is 1.5% ± 0.8% in the cluster and 1.2% ± 0.8% in the field. Compared with the z ≈ 0.1 fraction of 0.30%, the fraction of K+A galaxies in the CNOC1 field sample is greater by perhaps a factor of 4, but with only 1 σ significance; no further evolution of this fraction is detectable over our redshift range. We compare our data with the results of PEGASE and GISSEL96 spectrophotometric models and conclude, from the relative fractions of red and blue galaxies with no [O II ] λ3727 emission and strong Hδ absorption, that up to 1.9% ± 0.8% of the cluster population may have had its star formation recently truncated without a starburst. However, this is still not significantly greater than the fraction of such galaxies in the field, 3.1% ± 1.0%. Furthermore, we do not detect an excess of cluster galaxies that have unambiguously undergone starbursts within the last 1 Gyr. In fact, at 6.3% ± 2.1%, the A+em galaxies that Poggianti et al. have recently suggested are dusty starbursts are twice as common in the field as in the cluster environment. Our results imply that these cluster environments are not responsible for inducing starbursts; thus, the increase in cluster blue galaxy fraction with redshift may not be a strictly cluster-specific phenomenon. We suggest that the truncation of star formation in clusters may largely be a gradual process, perhaps due to the exhaustion of gas in the galactic disks over fairly long timescales; in this case differential evolution may result because field galaxies can refuel their disks with gas from extended halos, thus regenerating star formation, while cluster galaxies may not have such halos and so continue to evolve passively.},

A set of mosaics and catalogs have been produced that are ≈80% complete and ≈99% reliable to their chosen flux density limits. The main field survey covers 3.8 deg 2 and has flux density limits of 20, 25, 100, and 100 μJy at wavelengths of 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 μm, respectively. The deeper "verification" survey covers 0.25 deg 2 with limits of 10, 10, 30, and 30 μJy, respectively. We also include deep data in the ELAIS-N1 field, which covers 0.041 deg 2 with limits of 4, 3, 10, and 10 μJy, respectively, but with only two wavelength coverages at a given sky position. The final bandmerged catalogs contain 103,193 objects in the main field, 12,224 in the verification field, and 5239 in ELAIS-N1. Flux densities of high signal-to-noise objects are accurate to about 10%, and the residual systematic error in the absolute flux density scale is ~2%-3%. We have successfully extracted sources at source densities as high as 100,000 deg -2 in our deepest 3.6 and 4.5 μm data. The mosaics and source catalogs will be made available through the Spitzer Science Center archive and the Infrared Science Archive.},

The majority (>90%) of galaxies with z > 1.3 are identified with ( [3.6] − [4.5]) AB > − 0.1 mag. We identify candidate galaxy clusters at z > 1 by selecting overdensities of ≥26-28 objects with [3.6] − [4.5] > − 0.1 mag within radii of 1.4', which corresponds to r < 0.5 h −1 Mpc at z = 1.5. These candidate galaxy clusters show strong angular clustering, with an angular correlation function represented by w (θ ) = (3.1 ± 0.5)(θ/1') −1.1 ± 0.1 over scales of 2'- 100'. Assuming the redshift distribution of these galaxy clusters follows a fiducial model, these galaxy clusters have a spatial-clustering scale length r 0 = 22.4 ± 3.6 h −1 Mpc and a comoving number density n = 1.2 ± 0.1 × 10 −5 h 3 Mpc −3 . The correlation scale length and number density of these objects are comparable to those of rich galaxy clusters at low redshift. The number density of these high-redshift clusters corresponds to dark matter halos larger than (3–5) × 10 13 h −1 M ☉ at z = 1.5. Assuming the dark halos hosting these high-redshift clusters grow following ΛCDM models, these clusters will reside in halos larger than (1–2) × 10 14 h −1 M ☉ at z = 0.2, comparable to rich galaxy clusters.},

We use a simple algorithm to select candidate high-redshift clusters of galaxies based on Spitzer /IRAC mid-infrared data combined with shallow all-sky optical data. We identify distant cluster candidates adopting an overdensity threshold that results in a high purity (80%) cluster sample based on tests in the Spitzer Deep, Wide-Field Survey of the Boötes field. Our simple algorithm detects all three 1.4 < z ≤ 1.75 X-ray detected clusters in the Boötes field. The uniqueness of the SSDF survey resides not just in its area, one of the largest contiguous extragalactic fields observed with Spitzer , but also in its deep, multi-wavelength coverage by the South Pole Telescope (SPT), Herschel /SPIRE, and XMM-Newton . This rich data set will allow direct or stacked measurements of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect decrements or X-ray masses for many of the SSDF clusters presented here, and enable a systematic study of the most distant clusters on an unprecedented scale. We measure the angular correlation function of our sample and find that these candidates show strong clustering. Employing the COSMOS/UltraVista photometric catalog in order to infer the redshift distribution of our cluster selection, we find that these clusters have a comoving number density ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/797/2/109/apj503986ieqn1.gif] {$n_c = (0.7^{+6.3}_{-0.6}) \times 10^{-7} \; h^{3} \;\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$} and a spatial clustering correlation scale length r 0 = (32 ± 7) h –1 Mpc.

  abstract = {We use very deep near-infrared photometry of the Hubble Deep Field-South taken with ISAAC on the Very Large Telescope to identify a population of high-redshift galaxies with rest-frame optical colors similar to those of nearby galaxies. The galaxies are chosen by their infrared colors J s - K s > 2.3, aimed at selecting galaxies with redshifts above 2. When applied to our data set, we find 14 galaxies with K s < 22.5, corresponding to a surface density of 3 ± 0.8 arcmin -2 . The photometric redshifts all lie above 1.9, with a median of 2.6 and an rms of 0.7. The spectral energy distributions of these galaxies show a wide range. One is very blue in the rest-frame UV and satisfies the normal Lyman break criteria for high-redshift, star-forming galaxies. Others are quite red throughout the observed spectral range and are extremely faint in the optical, with a median V = 26.6. Hence, these galaxies would not be included in photometric samples based on optical ground-based data, and spectroscopic follow-up is difficult. The spectral energy distributions often show a prominent break, identified as the Balmer break or the 4000 Å break. The median age is 1 Gyr when fitted with a constant star formation model with dust or 0.7 Gyr when fitted with a single burst model. Although significantly younger ages cannot be excluded when a larger range of models is allowed, the results indicate that these galaxies are among the oldest at these redshifts. The volume density to K s = 22.5 is half that of Lyman break galaxies at z ≈ 3. Since the mass-to-light ratios of the red galaxies are likely to be higher, the stellar mass density is inferred to be comparable to that of Lyman break galaxies. These red galaxies may be the descendants of galaxies that started to form stars at very high redshifts, and they may evolve into the most massive galaxies at low redshift.},

The model is calibrated to reproduce the colour-magnitude relation for Coma ellipticals at z \~{} 0 and gives the evolution of the slope and zero-point as a function of redshift. We find no significant differences between the colour-magnitude relations of the clusters in our sample. The slopes can be reproduced by a single model sequence in which all elliptical galaxies are assumed to be equally old (the maximum age difference allowed for the brightest 3 magnitudes is only 1 Gyr) and to have mean stellar metallicities which vary as a function of galaxy luminosity. The zero-points of the colour-magnitude relations constrain the epoch of major star formation in early-type galaxies to z\_f$\gt$2-4. This study provides two important constraints for any model of the formation of rich clusters: the uniformity of the ages of the stellar populations in the early-type galaxies and the universality of the metallicity sequence of these galaxies as a function of galaxy mass.},

We describe here the scientific motivation for a large-area sky survey at radio frequencies which has a sensitivity and angular resolution comparable to the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey, and we recount the history that led to the current survey project. The technical design of the survey is covered in detail, including a description and justification of the grid pattern chosen, the rationale behind the integration time and angular resolution selected, and a summary of the other considerations which informed our planning for the project. A comprehensive description of the automated data analysis pipeline we have developed is presented.  We also report here the results of the first year of FIRST observations. A total of 144 hr of time in 1993 April and May was used for a variety of tests, as well as to cover an initial strip of the survey extending between 07$^{h}$ 15$^{m}$ and 16$^{h}$ 30$^{m}$ in a 2{\deg}.8 wide declination zone passing through the local zenith (28.2 $\lt${$\delta$} $\lt$ 31.0).

A catalog derived from this 300 deg$^{2}$ region contains 28,000 radio sources. We have performed extensive tests on the images and source list in order to establish the photometric and astrometric accuracy of these data products. We find systematic astrometric errors of $\lt$ 0''.05 individual sources down to the 1 mJy survey flux density threshold have 90\% confidence error circles with radii of $\lt$ 1``. CLEAN bias introduces a systematic underestimate of point-source flux densities of {\tilde}0.25 mJy; the bias is more severe for extended sources. Nonetheless, a comparison with a published deep survey field demonstrates that we successfully detect 39/49 sources with integrated flux densities greater than 0.75 mJy, including 19 of 20 sources above 2.0 mJy; the sources not detected are known to be very extended and so have surface brightnesses well below our threshold.  With 480 hr of observing time committed for each of the next three B-configuration periods, FIRST will complete nearly one-half of its goal of covering the 10,000 deg$^{2}$ of the north Galactic cap scheduled for inclusion in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. All of the FIRST data raw visibilities, self-calibrated UV data sets, individual pointing maps, final merged images, source catalogs, and individual source images are being placed in the public domain as soon as they are verified; all of the 1993 data are now available through the NRAO and/or the STScI archive. We conclude with a brief summary of the scientific significance of FIRST, which represents an improvement by a factor of 50 in both angular resolution and sensitivity over the best available large area radio surveys.},

The low rate of confirmation is attributable both to high rest-frame optical obscuration in our targets and limited sensitivity to certain redshift ranges.

The high-quality photometric redshifts available in the COSMOS field allow us to test the robustness of photometric redshifts for DSFGs. We find a subset ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/840/2/101/apjaa6cb1ieqn10.gif] {$11/31\approx 35$} %) of DSFGs with inaccurate ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/840/2/101/apjaa6cb1ieqn11.gif] {${\rm{\Delta }}z/(1+z)\gt 0.2$} ) or non-existent photometric redshifts; these have very distinct spectral energy distributions from the remaining DSFGs, suggesting a decoupling of highly obscured and unobscured components. We present a composite rest-frame 4300–7300 Å spectrum for DSFGs, and find evidence of 200 ± 30 km s −1 gas outflows. Nebular line emission for a subsample of our detections indicate that hard ionizing radiation fields are ubiquitous in high- z DSFGs, even more so than typical mass or UV-selected high- z galaxies. We also confirm the extreme level of dust obscuration in DSFGs, measuring very high Balmer decrements and very high ratios of IR to UV and IR to H α luminosities. This work demonstrates the need to broaden the use of wide bandwidth technology in the millimeter to spectroscopically confirm larger samples of high- z DSFGs, as the difficulty in confirming such sources at optical/near-infrared wavelengths is exceedingly challenging given their obscuration.},

These massive spheroidal galaxies have, in the present day, very little gas or dust in proportion to their mass$^{1}$, and their stellar populations have been evolving passively for over 10 billion years. The physical mechanisms that led to the termination of star formation in these galaxies and depletion of their interstellar medium remain largely conjectural. In particular, there are currently no direct measurements of the amount of residual gas that might still be present in newly quiescent spheroidals at high redshift$^{2}$. Here we show that quiescent ETGs at redshift z   1.8, close to their epoch of quenching, contained at least two orders of magnitude more dust at a fixed stellar mass compared with local ETGs. This implies the presence of substantial amounts of gas (5-10\%), which has been consumed less efficiently than in more active galaxies, probably due to their spheroidal morphology, consistent with our simulations. This lower star formation efficiency, combined with an extended hot gas halo possibly maintained by persistent feedback from an active galactic nucleus, keep ETGs mostly passive throughout cosmic time.},

  abstract = {In this dissertation, I study various aspects related to the gas and star formation in dusty star-forming galaxies in the distant universe. My dissertation is heavily based on observations made by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), observing a sample of gravitationally lensed high-redshift dusty galaxies originally discovered by the South Pole Telescope (SPT). In addition to the introductions to the individual chapters, Chapter 1 provides a broader background to the study of these objects and places them in the overall context of galaxy evolution. In Chapter 2 I describe a technique designed to search for faint molecular lines in the spectrum of high-redshift dusty galaxies. The brightest molecular lines in the spectra of these objects are due to carbon monoxide, but a host of other species are present in the interstellar media. These other molecules trace gas of a wide range of temperatures and densities, but are generally ten times fainter than the brighter CO lines. I detected several other molecular lines, and used them to characterize the conditions of the interstellar gas. This work was published in Spilker et al. (2014). In Chapter 3, I describe a technique for modeling the effects of gravitational lensing which is optimized for data from interferometers such as ALMA. Using these models and data for a large sample of objects from ALMA, I studied the intrinsic properties of the sample such as the source sizes and luminosities. I used these intrinsic properties to revisit topics from the literature which benefit from the additional size information I determined. This work was published in Spilker et al. (2016). In Chapter 4, I use the modeling technique I developed to investigate the relationship between the star formation and the cold molecular gas from which stars form in two objects selected from the SPT sample. Using the models of the source, I was able to determine the mass of molecular gas in these objects using several independent methods. I found that the molecular gas reservoirs are more extended than the star formation, which has implications for the ``law'' used as a prescription for star formation in many simulations. This work was published in Spilker et al. (2015). Chapter 5 describes ongoing work to determine what will happen to the dusty galaxies after their active phase of star formation ends, and what processes dominate that change. Since their discovery, these dusty galaxies have been thought to be progenitors of early quiescent galaxies. In this chapter, I show observations of a massive molecular outflow from a single object, which may be responsible for removing the raw material for star formation. Finally, in Chapter 6, I end with a summary of this dissertation.},

FIR luminous starburst galaxies are usually interpreted as major wet mergers. We find that the average morphologies of SB galaxies are disky and generally have much more diffuse optical light profile than massive compact early-type galaxies (ETGs), challenging gas-rich merging as the primary dissipative mechanism to assemble very compact, massive galaxies. We find that the sizes of the SB galaxies are clearly larger than those of the MS galaxies on average. NIR to MIR colors of starburst galaxies show no evidence of highly dust-obscured compact component, which could eventually emerge as the massive compact core. Very compact SB galaxies are rather rare, and hence even from a statistical standpoint, our morphological analysis of starburst galaxies does not support the popular mechanism that powerful starburst in a highly dissipative wet merger of gas-rich disks, and subsequent quenching, is the key driver behind the formation of the massive, compact early-type galaxies observed at z\~{}2. The light distribution of the bulk of stars in starburst galaxies is simply not compact enough to eventually evolve into the massive ultra compact ETGs at high redshift universe.},

  abstract     = {We propose to take advantage of the nearly all-sky coverage of the Galaxy Evolution Explorer and Wide Field Infrared Surveyor missions to construct a combined atlas of ultraviolet and mid-infrared intensity images for almost all massive galaxies within 40 Mpc as well as several key local galaxy surveys beyond this volume. Following established methodology, we will use these to construct resolved estimates of the star formation rate surface density (the recent rate of star formation per unit area) across the whole local galaxy population. We will then use this atlas to measure basic facts about star formation in the local universe: where are most stars forming? Where are galaxies of different masses and morphologies most rapidly increasing their mass and where are they quenched? How common are ``extreme'' events like nuclear or off-nuclear starbursts? The limited resolution of infrared telescopes has made it difficult to address these questions in large samples before the latest generation of NASA missions. These local galaxies have been, and will remain, the subject of much focused study. The atlas will also serve as a reference point to place smaller samples studied in greater detail into the full context of the galaxy population; for example, we highlight the ability to place detailed studies of gas and dust in moderate-size galaxies into the broader context of galaxy evolution. The prospect to make homogenously constructed, extinction robust, resolved maps of a huge set of galaxies is only now available and offers a powerful chance to link these two fields (nearby galaxy studies and statistical studies of galaxy evolution and population). It will also serve as an invaluable resource to target future detailed studies with telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope that are optimized for extraordinarily detailed study of comparatively small areas and so require the sort of {\ldquo}finding chart{\rdquo} that we propose to produce. This goal of mapping all star formation in the local galaxy population bears directly on NASA's broad goals of understand how the universe works and the origins of stars, planets, and galaxies. This project will also enhance the legacy value of two phenomenal NASA missions by producing a set of broadly useful high level science products and using them to address fundamental scientific questions. It will also aid in targeting of future NASA observations and help place key work by earlier missions in context. It will also be a substantial resource to the community, producing useful data products and serving as a bridge between the often too-separated fields of nearby galaxy studies and galaxy evolution.},

  title    = {Star formation across galactic environments},
  school   = {The Pennsylvania State University},
  year     = {2012},
  abstract = {I present here parallel investigations of star formation in typical and extreme galaxies. The typical galaxies are selected to be free of active galactic nuclei (AGN), while the extreme galaxies host quasars (the most luminous class of AGN). These two environments are each insightful in their own way; quasars are among the most violent objects in the universe, literally reshaping their host galaxies, while my sample of AGN-free star-forming galaxies ranges from systems larger than the Milky Way to small galaxies which are forming stars at unsustainably high rates. The current paradigm of galaxy formation and evolution suggests that extreme circumstances are key stepping stones in the assembly of galaxies like our Milky Way. To test this paradigm and fully explore its ramifications, this dual approach is needed. My sample of AGN-free galaxies is drawn from the KPNO International Spectroscopic Survey. This Halpha-selected, volume-limited survey was designed to detect star-forming galaxies without a bias toward continuum luminosity. This type of selection ensures that this sample is not biased toward galaxies that are large or nearby. My work studies the KISS galaxies in the mid- and far-infrared using photometry from the IRAC and MIPS instruments aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. These infrared bands are particularly interesting for star formation studies because the ultraviolet light from young stars is reprocessed into thermal emission in the far-infrared (24mum MIPS) by dust and into vibrational transitions features in the mid-infrared (8.0mum IRAC) by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The work I present here examines the efficiencies of PAH and thermal dust emission as tracers of star-formation rates over a wide range of galactic stellar masses. I find that the efficiency of PAH as a star-formation tracer varies with galactic stellar mass, while thermal dust has a highly variable efficiency that does not systematically depend on galactic stellar mass. Complementing this study of normal star-forming galaxies, my study of quasar host galaxies utilizes narrow- and medium-band images of eight Palomar-Green (PG) quasars from the WFPC2 and NICMOS instruments aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. Using images of a point-spread function (PSF) star in the same filters, I subtract the PSF of the quasar from each of the target images. The residual light images clearly show the host galaxies of the respective quasars. The narrow-band images were chosen to be centered on the Hbeta, [O II ], [O III], and Paalpha emission lines, allowing the use of line ratios and luminosities to create extinction and star formation maps. Additionally, I utilize the line-ratio maps to distinguish AGN-powered line emission from star formation powered line emission with line-diagnostic diagrams. I find star formation in each of the eight quasar host galaxies in my study. The bulk star-formation rates are lower than expected, suggesting that quasar host galaxies may be dynamically more advanced than previously believed. Seven of the eight quasar host galaxies in this study have higher-than-typical mass-specific star-formation rates. Additionally, I see evidence of shocked gas, supporting the hypotheses presented in earlier works that suggest that AGN activity quenches star formation in its host galaxy by disrupting its gas reservoir.},

Not only are these SMGs members of the protocluster, but they in fact reside within the node at the junction of the 50 Mpc scale filamentary three-dimensional structure traced by Ly α emitters in this field. The eight SMGs account for a star formation rate density (SFRD) ∼10 M ⊙ yr −1 Mpc −3 in the node, which is two orders of magnitudes higher than the global SFRD at this redshift. We find that four of the eight SMGs host an X-ray-luminous active galactic nucleus. Our results suggest that the vigorous star formation activity and the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) occurred simultaneously in the densest regions at z ∼ 3, which may correspond to the most active historical phase of the massive galaxy population found in the core of the clusters in the present universe. Two SMGs are associated with Ly α blobs, implying that the two populations coexist in high-density environments for a few cases.},

These results suggest that the major 1.2 mm EBL contributors are sources with 0.02 mJy, and that very faint 1.2 mm sources with ≲0.02 mJy contribute negligibly to the EBL with the possible flattening and/or truncation of number counts in this very faint flux regime. To understand the physical origin of our faint ALMA sources, we measure the galaxy bias b g by the counts-in-cells technique, and place a stringent upper limit of b g < 3.5 that is not similar to b g values of massive distant red galaxies and submillimeter galaxies but comparable to those of UV-bright, star-forming BzK galaxies (sBzKs) and Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). Moreover, in the optical and near-infrared (NIR) deep fields, we identify optical-NIR counterparts for 59% of our faint ALMA sources, the majority of which have luminosities, colors, and the IRX- β relation the same as sBzKs and LBGs. We thus conclude that about a half of our faint ALMA sources are dust-poor, high- z galaxies as known as sBzKs and LBGs in optical studies, and that these faint ALMA sources are not miniature (U)LIRGs simply scaled down with the infrared brightness.},

We introduce the method and we discuss the expected influence of the different observational conditions and theoretical assumptions. In particular, the set of templates used in the minimization procedure (age, metallicity, reddening, absorption in the Lyman forest,...) is studied in detail, through both real and simulated data. The expected accuracy of photometric redshifts, as well as the fraction of catastrophic identifications and wrong detections, is given as a function of the redshift range, the set of filters considered, and the photometric accuracy. Special attention is paid to the results expected from real data.},

The remaining 17 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/663/1/81/img1.gif] {img1.gif} % of AGNs show star-forming galaxy SEDs (SF class). The sources with AGN signatures are divided in two classes, AGN1 (33 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/663/1/81/img2.gif] {img2.gif} %) and AGN2 (50 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/663/1/81/img3.gif] {img3.gif} %). The AGN1 and AGN2 classes include sources whose SEDs are fitted by type 1 and type 2 AGN templates, respectively. On average, AGN1s show soft X-ray spectra, consistent with being unabsorbed, while AGN2s and SFs show hard X-ray spectra, consistent with being absorbed. The analysis of the average SEDs as a function of X-ray luminosity shows a reddening of the infrared SEDs, consistent with a decreasing contribution from the host galaxy at higher luminosities. The AGNs in the SF classes are likely obscured in the mid-infrared, as suggested by their low L 3-20 μm / L ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/663/1/81/img4.gif] {img4.gif} ratios. We confirm the previously found correlation for AGNs between the radio luminosity and the X-ray and the mid-infrared luminosities. The X-ray-radio correlation can be used to identify heavily absorbed AGNs. However, the estimated radio fluxes for the missing AGN population responsible for the bulk of the background at E > 10 keV are too faint to be detected even in the deepest current radio surveys.},

  abstract = {New far-infrared and submillimeter photometry from the Herschel Space Observatory is presented for 61 nearby galaxies from the Key Insights on Nearby Galaxies: A Far-Infrared Survey with Herschel (KINGFISH) sample. The spatially integrated fluxes are largely consistent with expectations based on Spitzer far-infrared photometry and extrapolations to longer wavelengths using popular dust emission models. Dwarf irregular galaxies are notable exceptions, as already noted by other authors, as their 500 μm emission shows evidence for a submillimeter excess. In addition, the fraction of dust heating attributed to intense radiation fields associated with photodissociation regions is found to be (21 ± 4)% larger when Herschel data are included in the analysis. Dust masses obtained from the dust emission models of Draine & Li are found to be on average nearly a factor of two higher than those based on single-temperature modified blackbodies, as single blackbody curves do not capture the full range of dust temperatures inherent to any galaxy. The discrepancy is largest for galaxies exhibiting the coolest far-infrared colors.},

  abstract      = {In the past decade, our understanding of galaxy evolution has been revolutionized by the discovery that luminous, dusty starburst galaxies were 1,000 times more abundant in the early Universe than at present. It has, however, been difficult to measure the complete redshift distribution of these objects, especially at the highest redshifts (z $\gt$ 4). Here we report a redshift survey at a wavelength of three millimetres, targeting carbon monoxide line emission from the star-forming molecular gas in the direction of extraordinarily bright millimetre-wave-selected sources. High-resolution imaging demonstrates that these sources are strongly gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxies. We detect spectral lines in 23 out of 26 sources and multiple lines in 12 of those 23 sources, from which we obtain robust, unambiguous redshifts. At least 10 of the sources are found to lie at z $\gt$ 4, indicating that the fraction of dusty starburst galaxies at high redshifts is greater than previously thought. Models of lens geometries in the sample indicate that the background objects are ultra-luminous infrared galaxies, powered by extreme bursts of star formation.},

  abstract = { Over the past decade, observations of the cool interstellar medium (ISM) in distant galaxies via molecular and atomic fine structure line (FSL) emission have gone from a curious look into a few extreme, rare objects to a mainstream tool for studying galaxy formation out to the highest redshifts. Molecular gas has been observed in close to 200 galaxies at z > 1, including numerous AGN host-galaxies out to z ∼ 7, highly star-forming submillimeter galaxies, and increasing samples of main-sequence color-selected star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 1.5 to 2.5. Studies have moved well beyond simple detections to dynamical imaging at kiloparsec-scale resolution and multiline, multispecies studies that determine the physical conditions in the ISM in early galaxies. Observations of the cool gas are the required complement to studies of the stellar density and star-formation history of the Universe as they reveal the phase of the ISM that immediately precedes star formation in galaxies. Current observations suggest that the order of magnitude increase in the cosmic star-formation rate density from z ∼ 0 to 2 is commensurate with a similar increase in the gas-to-stellar mass ratio in star-forming disk galaxies. Progress has been made in determining the CO luminosity to H2 mass conversion factor at high z, and the dichotomy between high versus low values for main-sequence versus starburst galaxies, respectively, appears to persist with increasing redshift, with a likely dependence on metallicity and other local physical conditions. There may also be two sequences in the relationship between star-formation rate and gas mass: one for starbursts, in which the gas consumption timescale is short (a few 107 years), and one for main sequence galaxies, with an order of magnitude longer gas consumption timescale. Studies of atomic FSL emission are rapidly progressing, with some tens of galaxies detected in the exceptionally bright [Cii] 158-μm line to date. The [Cii] line is proving to be a unique tracer of galaxy dynamics in the early Universe and, together with other atomic FSLs, has the potential to be the most direct means of obtaining spectroscopic redshifts for the first galaxies during cosmic reionization. },

  abstract = { CO line emission represents the most accessible and widely used tracer of the molecular ISM. This renders the translation of observed CO intensity into total H2 gas mass critical to understanding star formation and the ISM in our Galaxy and beyond. We review the theoretical underpinning, techniques, and results of efforts to estimate this CO-to-H2 “conversion factor,” XCO, in different environments. In the Milky Way disk, we recommend a conversion factor of cm−2 (K km s−1)−1 with ±30\% uncertainty. Studies of other “normal galaxies” return similar values in Milky Way–like disks, but with greater scatter and systematic uncertainty. Departures from this Galactic conversion factor are both observed and expected. Dust-based determinations, theoretical arguments, and scaling relations all suggest that XCO increases with decreasing metallicity, turning up sharply below metallicity ∼1/3–1/2 solar in a manner consistent with model predictions that identify shielding as a key parameter. Based on spectral line modeling and dust observations, XCO appears to drop in the central, bright regions of some but not all galaxies, often coincident with regions of bright CO emission and high stellar surface density. This lower XCO is also present in the overwhelmingly molecular ISM of starburst galaxies, where several lines of evidence point to a lower CO-to-H2 conversion factor. At high redshift, direct evidence regarding the conversion factor remains scarce; we review what is known based on dynamical modeling and other arguments. },

We extend our sample to high redshifts ( z > 1) by including 35 submillimeter selected dusty star forming galaxies from the literature with robust CO observations, and sufficiently well-sampled FIR/submillimeter spectral energy distributions (SEDs), so that accurate FIR luminosities can be determined. The addition of luminous starbursts at high redshifts enlarge the range of the FIR–CO luminosity relations toward the high-IR-luminosity end, while also significantly increasing the small amount of mid- J /high- J CO line data ( J = 5-4 and higher) that was available prior to Herschel . This new data set (both in terms of IR luminosity and J -ladder) reveals linear FIR–CO luminosity relations (i.e., α ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sime.gif] {sime} 1) for J = 1-0 up to J = 5-4, with a nearly constant normalization (β ~ 2). In the simplest physical scenario, this is expected from the (also) linear FIR–(molecular line) relations recently found for the dense gas tracer lines (HCN and CS), as long as the dense gas mass fraction does not vary strongly within our (merger/starburst)-dominated sample. However, from J = 6-5 and up to the J = 13-12 transition, we find an increasingly sublinear slope and higher normalization constant with increasing J . We argue that these are caused by a warm (~100 K) and dense (>10 4 cm –3 ) gas component whose thermal state is unlikely to be maintained by star-formation-powered far-UV radiation fields (and thus is no longer directly tied to the star formation rate). We suggest that mechanical heating (e.g., supernova-driven turbulence and shocks), and not cosmic rays, is the more likely source of energy for this component. The global CO spectral line energy distributions, which remain highly excited from J = 6-5 up to J = 13-12, are found to be a generic feature of the (U)LIRGs in our sample, and further support the presence of this gas component.},

This result is based on carbon monoxide (CO) observations of galaxy populations at low and high redshifts, and on the current consensus for the CO luminosity to gas mass conversion factors. The data suggest the existence of two different SF regimes: a long-lasting mode for disks and a more rapid mode for starbursts, the latter probably occurring during major mergers or in dense nuclear SF regions. Both modes are observable over a large range of SFRs. The detection of CO emission from distant near-IR selected galaxies reveals such bimodal behavior for the first time, as they allow us to probe gas in disk galaxies with much higher SFRs than are seen locally. The different regimes can potentially be interpreted as the effect of a top-heavy initial mass function in starbursts. However, we favor a different physical origin related to the fraction of molecular gas in dense clouds. The IR luminosity to gas mass ratio (i.e., the SF efficiency) appears to be inversely proportional to the dynamical (rotation) timescale. Only when accounting for the dynamical timescale, a universal SF law is obtained, suggesting a direct link between global galaxy properties and the local SFR.},

  abstract      = {We present a 69 arcmin$^2$ ALMA survey at 1.1mm, GOODS-ALMA, matching the deepest HST-WFC3 H-band part of the GOODS-South field. We taper the 0``24 original image with a homogeneous and circular synthesized beam of 0''60 to reduce the number of independent beams - thus reducing the number of purely statistical spurious detections - and optimize the sensitivity to point sources. We extract a catalogue of galaxies purely selected by ALMA and identify sources with and without HST counterparts. ALMA detects 20 sources brighter than 0.7 mJy at 1.1mm in the 0``60 tapered mosaic (rms sensitivity $\sigma \simeq$ 0.18 mJy/beam) with a purity greater than 80\%. Among these detections, we identify three sources with no HST nor Spitzer-IRAC counterpart, consistent with the expected number of spurious galaxies from the analysis of the inverted image; their definitive status will require additional investigation. An additional three sources with HST counterparts are detected either at high significance in the higher resolution map, or with different detection-algorithm parameters ensuring a purity greater than 80\%. Hence we identify in total 20 robust detections. Our wide contiguous survey allows us to push further in redshift the blind detection of massive galaxies with ALMA with a median redshift of $\bar{z}$ = 2.92 and a median stellar mass of $\overline{M\_{\star}}$ = 1.1 $\times 10^{11}$M$\_\odot$. Our sample includes 20\% HST-dark galaxies (4 out of 20), all detected in the mid-infrared with Spitzer-IRAC. The near-infrared based photometric redshifts of two of them ($z \sim$4.3 and 4.8) suggest that these sources have redshifts $z \gt$ 4. At least 40\% of the ALMA sources host an X-ray AGN, compared to $\sim$14\% for other galaxies of similar mass and redshift. The wide area of our ALMA survey provides lower values at the bright end of number counts than single-dish telescopes affected by confusion.},

  abstract = {Dust-enshrouded, starbursting, submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) at z ≥ 3 have been proposed as progenitors of z ≥ 2 compact quiescent galaxies (cQGs). To test this connection, we present a detailed spatially resolved study of the stars, dust, and stellar mass in a sample of six submillimeter-bright starburst galaxies at z ∼ 4.5. The stellar UV emission probed by HST is extended and irregular and shows evidence of multiple components. Informed by HST , we deblend Spitzer /IRAC data at rest-frame optical, finding that the systems are undergoing minor mergers with a typical stellar mass ratio of 1:6.5. The FIR dust continuum emission traced by ALMA locates the bulk of star formation in extremely compact regions (median r e = 0.70 ± 0.29 kpc), and it is in all cases associated with the most massive component of the mergers (median ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/856/2/121/apjaab206ieqn1.gif] {$\mathrm{log}({M}_{* }/{M}_{\odot })=10.49\pm 0.32$} ). We compare spatially resolved UV slope ( β ) maps with the FIR dust continuum to study the infrared excess(IRX = L IR / L UV )– β relation. The SMGs display systematically higher IRX values than expected from the nominal trend, demonstrating that the FIR and UV emissions are spatially disconnected. Finally, we show that the SMGs fall on the mass–size plane at smaller stellar masses and sizes than the cQGs at z = 2. Taking into account the expected evolution in stellar mass and size between z = 4.5 and z = 2 due to the ongoing starburst and mergers with minor companions, this is in agreement with a direct evolutionary connection between the two populations.},

  abstract = {We aim to provide a holistic view on the typical size and kinematic evolution of massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) that encompasses their high- z star-forming progenitors, their high- z quiescent counterparts, and their configurations in the local Universe. Our investigation covers the main processes playing a relevant role in the cosmic evolution of ETGs. Specifically, their early fast evolution comprises biased collapse of the low angular momentum gaseous baryons located in the inner regions of the host dark matter halo; cooling, fragmentation, and infall of the gas down to the radius set by the centrifugal barrier; further rapid compaction via clump/gas migration toward the galaxy center, where strong heavily dust-enshrouded star formation takes place and most of the stellar mass is accumulated; and ejection of substantial gas amount from the inner regions by feedback processes, which causes a dramatic puffing-up of the stellar component. In the late slow evolution, passive aging of stellar populations and mass additions by dry merger events occur. We describe these processes relying on prescriptions inspired by basic physical arguments and by numerical simulations to derive new analytical estimates of the relevant sizes, timescales, and kinematic properties for individual galaxies along their evolution. Then we obtain quantitative results as a function of galaxy mass and redshift, and compare them to recent observational constraints on half-light size R e , on the ratio v / σ between rotation velocity and velocity dispersion (for gas and stars) and on the specific angular momentum j ⋆ of the stellar component; we find good consistency with the available multiband data in average values and dispersion, both for local ETGs and for their z ∼ 1–2 star-forming and quiescent progenitors. The outcomes of our analysis can provide hints to gauge sub-grid recipes implemented in simulations, to tune numerical experiments focused on specific processes, and to plan future multiband, high-resolution observations on high-redshift star-forming and quiescent galaxies with next-generation facilities.},

  abstract = {We report on a complete sample of seven luminous early-type galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF) with spectroscopic redshifts between 1.39 and 2.47, and to K AB < 23. Using the BzK selection criterion, we have preselected a set of objects over the UDF, which fulfill the photometric conditions for being passively evolving galaxies at z > 1.4. Low-resolution spectra of these objects have been extracted from the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) ACS grism data taken over the UDF by the Grism ACS Program for Extragalactic Science (GRAPES) project. Redshifts for the seven galaxies have been identified based on the UV feature at rest frame 2640 < λ < 2850 Å. This feature is mainly due to a combination of Fe II , Mg I , and Mg II absorptions, which are characteristic of stellar populations dominated by stars older than ~0.5 Gyr. The redshift identification and the passively evolving nature of these galaxies is further supported by the photometric redshifts and by the overall spectral energy distribution (SED), with the ultradeep HST ACS NICMOS imaging revealing compact morphologies typical of elliptical/early-type galaxies. From the SED we derive stellar masses of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {gtrsim} 10 11 M ☉ and ages of ~1 Gyr. Their space density at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lang.gif] {lang} z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rang.gif] {rang} = 1.7 appears to be roughly a factor of 2-3 smaller than that of their local counterparts, further supporting the notion that such massive and old galaxies are already ubiquitous at early cosmic times. Much smaller effective radii are derived for some of the objects, compared to local massive ellipticals, which may be due to morphological K -corrections, evolution, or the presence of a central pointlike source. Nuclear activity is indeed present in a subset of the galaxies, as revealed by the fact that they are hard X-ray sources, which suggests that active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity may have played a role in discontinuing star formation.},

As is typical for cSFGs, this galaxy has a stellar mass of 1.89 {\plusmn} 0.47 {\times} 10$^{11}$M$_{⊙}$, with a star formation rate (SFR) of 214 {\plusmn} 44 M$_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$ putting it on the star-forming ``main-sequence'', but with an H-band effective radius of 2.5 kpc, making it much smaller than the bulk of ``main-sequence'' star-forming galaxies. The intensity ratio of the line detections yield an ISM density (  6 {\times} 10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$) and a UV-radiation field (  2 {\times} 10$^{4}$G$_{0}$), similar to the values in local starburst and ultra-luminous infrared galaxy environments. A starburst phase is consistent with the short depletion times (t$_{H2,dep}$ {\le} 140 Myr) we find in 3D-HST GS30274 using three different proxies for the H$_{2}$ mass ([CI], CO, dust mass). This depletion time is significantly shorter than in more extended SFGs with similar stellar masses and SFRs. Moreover, the gas fraction of 3D-HST GS30274 is smaller than typically found in extended galaxies. We measure the CO and [CI] kinematics and find a FWHM line width of   750 {\plusmn} 41 km s$^{-1}$. The CO and [CI] FWHM are consistent with a previously measured H{$\alpha$} FWHM for this source. The line widths are consistent with gravitational motions, suggesting we are seeing a compact molecular gas reservoir. A previous merger event, as suggested by the asymmetric light profile, may be responsible for the compact distribution of gas and has triggered a central starburst event. This event gives rise to the starburst-like ISM properties and short depletion times in 3D-HST GS30274. The centrally located and efficient star formation is quickly building up a dense core of stars, responsible for the compact distribution of stellar light in 3D-HST GS30274.},

These galaxies are selected from sensitive blank-field surveys of the 2′ × 2′ Hubble Ultra-Deep Field at λ = 5 cm and 1.3 mm using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. They have star formation rates (SFRs), stellar masses, and dust properties representative of massive main-sequence SFGs at z ∼ 2. Morphological classification performed on spatially resolved stellar mass maps indicates a mixture of disk and morphologically disturbed systems; half of the sample harbor X-ray active galactic nuclei (AGNs), thereby representing a diversity of z ∼ 2 SFGs undergoing vigorous mass assembly. We find that their intense star formation most frequently occurs at the location of stellar-mass concentration and extends over an area comparable to their stellar-mass distribution, with a median diameter of 4.2 ± 1.8 kpc. This provides direct evidence of galaxy-wide star formation in distant blank-field-selected main-sequence SFGs. The typical galactic-average SFR surface density is 2.5 M ⊙ yr −1 kpc −2 , sufficiently high to drive outflows. In X-ray-selected AGN where radio emission is enhanced over the level associated with star formation, the radio excess pinpoints the AGNs, which are found to be cospatial with star formation. The median extinction-independent size of main-sequence SFGs is two times larger than those of bright submillimeter galaxies, whose SFRs are 3–8 times larger, providing a constraint on the characteristic SFR (∼300 M ⊙ yr −1 ) above which a significant population of more compact SFGs appears to emerge.},

Galaxies above the main sequence (MS) have larger gas masses but are converting their ISM into stars on a timescale only slightly shorter than those on the MS; thus, these “starbursts” are largely the result of having greatly increased gas masses rather than an increased efficiency of converting gas to stars. At z > 1, the entire population of star-forming galaxies has ∼2–5 times shorter gas depletion times than low- z galaxies. These shorter depletion times indicate a different mode of star formation in the early universe—most likely dynamically driven by compressive, high-dispersion gas motions—a natural consequence of the high gas accretion rates.},

In the detected compact galaxy, we see no evidence of rotation or that the CO-emitting gas is spatially extended relative to the stellar light. This casts doubt on recent suggestions that the gas in these compact galaxies is rotating and significantly extended compared to the stars.

We constrain the scaling relations of molecular gas depletion timescale ( t depl ) and gas to stellar mass ratio ( M mol gas / M * ) of SFGs near the star formation "main-sequence" with redshift, specific star-formation rate (sSFR), and stellar mass ( M * ). The CO- and dust-based scaling relations agree remarkably well. This suggests that the CO → H 2 mass conversion factor varies little within ±0.6 dex of the main sequence (sSFR(ms, z , M * )), and less than 0.3 dex throughout this redshift range. This study builds on and strengthens the results of earlier work. We find that t depl scales as (1 + z ) –0.3 × (sSFR/sSFR(ms, z , M * )) –0.5 , with little dependence on M * . The resulting steep redshift dependence of M mol gas / M * ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} (1 + z ) 3 mirrors that of the sSFR and probably reflects the gas supply rate. The decreasing gas fractions at high M * are driven by the flattening of the SFR- M * relation. Throughout the probed redshift range a combination of an increasing gas fraction and a decreasing depletion timescale causes a larger sSFR at constant M * . As a result, galaxy integrated samples of the M mol gas -SFR rate relation exhibit a super-linear slope, which increases with the range of sSFR. With these new relations it is now possible to determine M mol gas with an accuracy of ±0.1 dex in relative terms, and ±0.2 dex including systematic uncertainties.},

Of 266 cataloged radio sources, 52 have X-ray counterparts in the CDF-S and a further 37 have counterparts in the E-CDF-S area not covered by the 1 Ms exposure. Using a wide range of material, we have found optical or infrared counterparts for 254 radio sources, of which 186 have either spectroscopic or photometric redshifts. Three radio sources have no apparent counterpart at any other wavelength. Measurements of the 20 cm radio flux density at the position of each CDF-S X-ray source detected a further 30 radio sources above a conservative 3 σ detection limit. X-ray and submillimeter observations have been traditionally used as a measure of AGN and star formation activity, respectively. These new observations probe the faint end of both the star formation and radio galaxy/AGN population, as well as the connection between the formation and evolution of stars and SMBHs. Both of the corresponding gravitational and nuclear fusion driven energy sources can lead to radio synchrotron emission. AGN and radio galaxies dominate at high flux densities. Although emission from star formation becomes more prominent at the microjansky levels reached by deep radio surveys, even for the weakest sources, we still find an apparent significant contribution from low-luminosity AGN as well as from star formation.},

Our technique improves on previous 2D fitting algorithms by allowing for irregular, curved, logarithmic and power-law spirals, ring, and truncated shapes in otherwise traditional parametric functions like the Sérsic, Moffat, King, Ferrer, etc., profiles. One can mix and match these new shape features freely, with or without constraints, and apply them to an arbitrary number of model components of numerous profile types, so as to produce realistic-looking galaxy model images. Yet, despite the potential for extreme complexity, the meaning of the key parameters like the Sérsic index, effective radius, or luminosity remains intuitive and essentially unchanged. The new features have an interesting potential for use to quantify the degree of asymmetry of galaxies, to quantify low surface brightness tidal features beneath and beyond luminous galaxies, to allow more realistic decompositions of galaxy subcomponents in the presence of strong rings and spiral arms, and to enable ways to gauge the uncertainties when decomposing galaxy subcomponents. We illustrate these new features by way of several case studies that display various levels of complexity.},

As was found by Dale and coworkers in 2001, a single parameter family, characterized by f ν (60 μm)/ f ν (100 μm), is adequate to describe the range of normal galaxy SEDs observed by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite and Infrared Space Observatory from 3 to 100 μm. However, predictions based on the first-generation models at longer wavelengths (122-850 μm) are increasingly overluminous compared to the data for smaller f ν (60 μm)/ f ν (100 μm), or alternatively, for weaker global interstellar radiation fields. After slightly modifying the far-infrared/submillimeter dust emissivity in those models as a function of the radiation field intensity to better match the long-wavelength data, a suite of SEDs from 3 μm to 20 cm in wavelength is presented. Results from relevant applications are also discussed, including submillimeter-based photometric redshift indicators, the infrared energy budget and simple formulae for recovering the bolometric infrared luminosity, and dust mass estimates in galaxies. Regarding the latter, since galaxy infrared SEDs are not well described by single blackbody curves, the usual methods of estimating dust masses can be grossly inadequate. The improved model presented herein is used to provide a more accurate relation between infrared luminosity and dust mass.},

For galaxies with L (TIR) ≥ 10 10 L ☉ , these new expressions should provide SFRs to within 0.2 dex. For L (TIR) ≥ 10 11 L ☉ , we find that the SFR of infrared galaxies is significantly underestimated using extinction-corrected Paα (and presumably using any other optical or near-infrared recombination lines). As a part of this work, we constructed spectral energy distribution templates for eleven luminous and ultraluminous purely star forming infrared galaxies and over the spectral range 0.4 μm to 30 cm. We use these templates and the SINGS data to construct average templates from 5 μm to 30 cm for infrared galaxies with L (TIR) = 5× 10 9 to 10 13 L ☉ .

We find a size distribution for the PAHs giving emission band ratios consistent with the observed spectra of the Milky Way and other galaxies. Emission spectra are presented for a wide range of starlight intensities. We calculate how the efficiency of emission into different IR bands depends on PAH size; the strong 7.7 μm emission feature is produced mainly by PAH particles containing <10 3 C atoms. We also calculate how the emission spectrum depends on U , the starlight intensity relative to the local interstellar radiation field. The submillimeter and far-infrared emission is compared to the observed emission from the local interstellar medium. Using a simple distribution function, we calculate the emission spectrum for dust heated by a distribution of starlight intensities, such as occurs within galaxies. The models are parameterized by the PAH mass fraction q PAH , the lower cutoff U min of the starlight intensity distribution, and the fraction γ of the dust heated by starlight with U > U min . We present graphical procedures using Spitzer IRAC and MIPS photometry to estimate the parameters q PAH , U min , and γ, the fraction f PDR of the dust luminosity coming from photodissociation regions with U > 100, and the total dust mass M dust .},

The redshift distribution of these SPIRE sources from the Herschel Multitiered Extragalactic Survey peaks at z = 0.85, with 731 sources at z < 2 and a tail of sources out to z ~ 5.

The infrared data are used to directly measure integrated infrared luminosities and dust temperatures independent of radio or 24 μm flux densities. By probing the dust spectral energy distribution (SED) at its peak, we estimate that the vast majority (72%-83%) of z < 2 Herschel -selected galaxies would drop out of traditional submillimeter surveys at 0.85-1 mm. We find that dust temperature traces infrared luminosity, due in part to the SPIRE wavelength selection biases, and partially from physical effects. As a result, we measure no significant trend in SPIRE color with redshift; if dust temperature were independent of luminosity or redshift, a trend in SPIRE color would be expected. Composite infrared SEDs are constructed as a function of infrared luminosity, showing the increase in dust temperature with luminosity, and subtle change in near-infrared and mid-infrared spectral properties.

The code is open source and has already been used in several published projects in the astrophysics literature. The algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has excellent performance as measured by the autocorrelation time (or function calls per independent sample). One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to ~ N 2 for a traditional algorithm in an N -dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our implementation. Exploiting the parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without extra effort.

  abstract = {Large amounts of dust ($\gt$10$^{8}$M$_{⊙}$) have recently been discovered in high-redshift quasars and galaxies corresponding to a time when the Universe was less than one-tenth of its present age. The stellar winds produced by stars in the late stages of their evolution (on the asymptotic giant branch of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram) are thought to be the main source of dust in galaxies, but they cannot produce that dust on a short enough timescale ($\lt$1Gyr) to explain the results in the high-redshift galaxies. Supernova explosions of massive stars (type II) are also a potential source, with models predicting 0.2-4M$_{⊙}$ of dust. As massive stars evolve rapidly, on timescales of a few Myr, these supernovae could be responsible for the high-redshift dust. Observations of supernova remnants in the Milky Way, however, have hitherto revealed only 10$^{-7}$-10$^{-3}$M$_{⊙}$ each, which is insufficient to explain the high-redshift data. Here we report the detection of \~{}2-4M$_{⊙}$ of cold dust in the youngest known Galactic supernova remnant, Cassiopeia A. This observation implies that supernovae are at least as important as stellar winds in producing dust in our Galaxy and would have been the dominant source of dust at high redshifts.},

We have simultaneously solved for α CO and the DGR by assuming that the DGR is approximately constant on kiloparsec scales. With this assumption, we can combine maps of dust mass surface density, CO-integrated intensity, and H I column density to solve for both α CO and the DGR with no assumptions about their value or dependence on metallicity or other parameters. Such a study has just become possible with the availability of high-resolution far-IR maps from the Herschel key program KINGFISH, 12CO J = (2-1) maps from the IRAM 30 m large program HERACLES, and H I 21 cm line maps from THINGS. We use a fixed ratio between the (2-1) and (1-0) lines to present our α CO results on the more typically used 12 CO J = (1-0) scale and show using literature measurements that variations in the line ratio do not affect our results. In total, we derive 782 individual solutions for α CO and the DGR. On average, α CO = 3.1 M ☉ pc –2 (K km s –1 ) –1 for our sample with a standard deviation of 0.3 dex. Within galaxies, we observe a generally flat profile of α CO as a function of galactocentric radius. However, most galaxies exhibit a lower α CO value in the central kiloparsec—a factor of ~2 below the galaxy mean, on average. In some cases, the central α CO value can be factors of 5-10 below the standard Milky Way (MW) value of α CO, MW = 4.4 M ☉ pc –2 (K km s –1 ) –1 . While for α CO we find only weak correlations with metallicity, the DGR is well-correlated with metallicity, with an approximately linear slope. Finally, we present several recommendations for choosing an appropriate α CO for studies of nearby galaxies.},

The 190-305 GHz observation band corresponds to the rest frame 272-444 μm, and we measure the dust continuum as well as all four transitions of carbon monoxide (CO) lying in this range. The power-law dust emission, F ν = 14 mJy(ν/240 GHz) 3.9 is consistent with the published continuum measurements. The CO J = 6 → 5, J = 8 → 7, and J = 9 → 8 measurements are the first, and now provide the highest- J CO information in this source. Our measured CO intensities are very close to the previously published interferometric measurements of J = 7 → 6, and we use all available transitions and our 13 CO upper limits to constrain the physical conditions in the Cloverleaf molecular gas disk. We find a large mass (2-50 × 10 9 M ☉ ) of highly excited gas with thermal pressure nT > 10 6 K cm –3 . The ratio of the total CO cooling to the far-IR dust emission exceeds that in the local dusty galaxies, and we investigate the potential heating sources for this bulk of warm molecular gas. We conclude that both UV photons and X-rays likely contribute, and discuss implications for a top-heavy stellar initial mass function arising in the X-ray-irradiated starburst. Finally, we present tentative identifications of other species in the spectrum, including a possible detection of the H 2 O \2 0,2 → 1 1,1 transition at λ rest = 303 μm.},

The mid- to high- J CO luminosity relative to CO J = 1−0 increases with increasing L FIR , indicating higher excitement of the molecular gas, although these ratios do not exceed ∼180. For a given bin in L FIR , the luminosities relative to CO J = 1−0 remain relatively flat from J = 6−5 through J = 13−12, across three orders of magnitude of L FIR . A single component theoretical photodissociation region (PDR) model cannot match these flat SLED shapes, although combinations of PDR models with mechanical heating added qualitatively match the shapes, indicating the need for further comprehensive modeling of the excitation processes of warm molecular gas in nearby galaxies.},

The new data reveal for the first time spatially resolved CO gas kinematics in the observed SMGs. Two of the SMGs show double or multiple morphologies, with complex, disturbed gas motions. The other two SMGs exhibit CO velocity gradients of ~500 km s −1 across ≤0.2 '' (1.6 kpc) diameter regions, suggesting that the star-forming gas is in compact, rotating disks. Our data provide compelling evidence that these SMGs represent extreme, short-lived "maximum" star-forming events in highly dissipative mergers of gas-rich galaxies. The resulting high-mass surface and volume densities of SMGs are similar to those of compact quiescent galaxies in the same redshift range and much higher than those in local spheroids. From the ratio of the comoving volume densities of SMGs and quiescent galaxies in the same mass and redshift ranges, and from the comparison of gas exhaustion timescales and stellar ages, we estimate that the SMG phase duration is about 100 Myr. Our analysis of SMGs and optically/UV selected high-redshift star-forming galaxies supports a "universal" Chabrier IMF as being valid over the star-forming history of these galaxies. We find that the 12 CO luminosity to total gas mass conversion factors at z ~ 2-3 are probably similar to those assumed at z ~ 0. The implied gas fractions in our sample galaxies range from 20% to 50%.},

  abstract  = {MOSFIRE is a unique multi-object spectrometer and imager for the Cassegrain focus of the 10 m Keck 1 telescope. A refractive optical design provides near-IR (0.97 to 2.45 {$\mu$}m) multi-object spectroscopy over a 6.14' x 6.14' field of view with a resolving power of R\~{}3,270 for a 0.7`` slit width (2.9 pixels in the dispersion direction), or imaging over a field of view of 6.8' diameter with 0.18'' per pixel sampling. A single diffraction grating can be set at two fixed angles, and order-sorting filters provide spectra that cover the K, H, J or Y bands by selecting 3rd, 4th, 5th or 6th order respectively. A folding flat following the field lens is equipped with piezo transducers to provide tip/tilt control for flexure compensation at the 0.1 pixel level. A special feature of MOSFIRE is that its multiplex advantage of up to 46 slits is achieved using a cryogenic Configurable Slit Unit or CSU developed in collaboration with the Swiss Centre for Electronics and Micro Technology (CSEM). The CSU is reconfigurable under remote control in less than 5 minutes without any thermal cycling of the instrument. Slits are formed by moving opposable bars from both sides of the focal plane. An individual slit has a length of 7.1`` but bar positions can be aligned to make longer slits. When masking bars are removed to their full extent and the grating is changed to a mirror, MOSFIRE becomes a wide-field imager. Using a single, ASIC-driven, 2K x 2K H2-RG HgCdTe array from Teledyne Imaging Sensors with exceptionally low dark current and low noise, MOSFIRE will be extremely sensitive and ideal for a wide range of science applications. This paper describes the design and testing of the instrument prior to delivery later in 2010.},

  abstract = {Surface photometry shows that most spiral and S0 galaxies have two main components: a spheroidal component, and an exponential disk component with radial surface-brightness distribution 1(R) = Ioe 5. The exponential disk is the subject of this paper. First, for the exponential disk in centrifugal equilibrium with surface density (R) = , we derive the circular-velocity field and the mass- angular momentum distribution (h); (h) is the total mass with angular momentum per unit mass less than h. (h) for the exponential disk is almost identical with (k) for a family of rigidly rotating spheres of uniform density. We then collect photometric data for the disks of thirty-six spiral and S0 galaxies, and find the following: (i) Twenty-eight of the thirty-six galaxies have approximately the same intensity scale 1o (21.65 B-mag per square second of arc), with a standard deviation of only 0.30 mag per square second of arc, despite a range of nearly 5 mag in absolute magnitude. This constancy of 1o produces the correlation between apparent magnitude and angular diameter found by Hubble. (ii) S0-Sbc systems have any value of the disk length scale between 1 and 5 kpc, while later-type systems have predominantly low values of a ($\lt$2 kpc). (iii) The relative brightness and size of the spheroidal and disk components are only weakly with morphological type. If conclusion (i) implies that s is approximately constant, then the disk's total mass and angular momentum satisfy 7/4 If (h) is invariant as a protogalaxy collapses to form a galaxy, then all protogalaxies destined to be S0 or spiral galaxies have a similar (h) (in dimensionless variables), at least for the range of h corresponding to the disk. If (k) is not invariant, then there exists a very efficient mechanism which establishes the characteristic ) (h) for these systems as they form. The exponential nature of the disk is not defined by i) alone; its cause remains uncertain.},

  abstract      = {We present optical photometry of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ACS/WFC data of the resolved stellar populations in the outer disc of the dwarf irregular galaxy DDO 154. The photometry reveals that young main sequence stars are almost absent from the outermost HI disc. Instead, most are clustered near the main stellar component of the galaxy. We constrain the stellar initial mass function (IMF) by comparing the luminosity function of the main sequence stars to simulated stellar populations assuming a constant star formation rate over the dynamical timescale. The best-fitting IMF is deficient in high mass stars compared to a canonical Kroupa IMF, with a best-fit slope $\alpha = -2.45$ and upper mass limit $M\_U = 16\ M\_{\odot}$. This top-light IMF is consistent with predictions of the Integrated Galaxy-wide IMF theory. Combining the HST images with HI data from The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury (THINGS) we determine the star formation law (SFL) in the outer disc. The fit has a power law exponent $N = 2.92 \pm0.22$ and zero point $A=4.47 \pm 0.65 \times 10^{-7} \ M\_{\odot} \ \text{yr}^{-1} \ \text{kpc}^{-2}$. This is depressed compared to the Kennicutt-Schmidt Star Formation Law, but consistent with weak star formation observed in diffuse HI environments. Extrapolating the SFL over the outer disc implies that there could be significant star formation occurring that is not detectable in H$\alpha$. Last, we determine the Toomre stability parameter $Q$ of the outer disc of DDO 154 using the THINGS HI rotation curve and velocity dispersion map. 72\% of the HI in our field has $Q\leq 4$ and this incorporates 96\% of the observed MS stars. Hence 28\% of the HI in the field is largely dormant.},

  abstract      = {If the Galaxy is axisymmetric and in dynamical equilibrium, we expect negligible fluctuations in the residual line-of-sight velocity field. However, non-axisymmetric structures like a bar, spiral arms and merger events can generate velocity fluctuations. Recent results using the APOGEE survey find significant fluctuations in velocity for stars in the midplane (|z|$\lt$ 0.25 kpc) and out to 5 kpc, which suggests that the dynamical influence of the Milky Way's bar extends out to the Solar neighborhood. Their measured power spectrum has a characteristic amplitude of 11 km/s on a scale of \~{} 2.5 kpc. The existence of large streaming motions on these scales has important implications for determining the Sun's motion about the Galactic Centre. Using red clump stars from the GALAH and APOGEE surveys, we map the line-of-sight velocity field around the Sun out to distances of 5 kpc and up to 1.25 kpc from the Galactic Plane. By subtracting a smooth axisymmetric model for the velocity field, we study the residual velocity fluctuations and compare our findings with mock survey generated by Galaxia based on an axisymmetric, steady state model. We find negligible large-scale fluctuations away from the plane. In the mid-plane, we reproduce the earlier APOGEE power spectrum results but with 20$\backslash$\% smaller amplitude (9.5 km/s) after taking a few systematic effects into account (e.g. volume completeness). The amplitude power is further reduced to 6.7 km/s if a flexible axisymmetric model is used. Additionally, our mock simulations show that, in the plane, the distances are underestimated for high mass red clump stars and this can lead to spurious power with amplitude of about 5.5 km/s. Taking this into account, we estimate the amplitude of real fluctuations to be less than 4.2 km/s, about a factor of three less than the previous result from APOGEE.},

Substantial object-to-object variations in both stellar and baryonic mass fractions are observed among the galaxies in our sample, larger than what can be accounted for by the formal uncertainties in their respective measurements. In both cases, the mass fractions correlate most strongly with measures of surface density. High- ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/831/2/149/apjaa3961ieqn10.gif] {${{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{\mathrm{star}}$} galaxies feature stellar mass fractions closer to unity, and systems with high inferred gas or baryonic surface densities leave less room for additional mass components other than stars and molecular gas. Our findings can be interpreted as more extended disks probing further (and more compact disks probing less far) into the dark matter halos that host them.},

  abstract      = {Understanding how bulges grow in galaxies is critical step towards unveiling the link between galaxy morphology and star-formation. To do so, it is necessary to decompose large sample of galaxies at different epochs into their main components (bulges and disks). This is particularly challenging, especially at high redshifts, where galaxies are poorly resolved. This work presents a catalog of bulge-disk decompositions of the surface brightness profiles of \~{}17.600 H-band selected galaxies in the CANDELS fields (F160W$\lt$23, 0$\lt$z$\lt$2) in 4 to 7 filters covering a spectral range of 430-1600nm. This is the largest available catalog of this kind up to z = 2. By using a novel approach based on deep-learning to select the best model to fit, we manage to control systematics arising from wrong model selection and obtain less contaminated samples than previous works. We show that the derived structural properties are within $\sim10-20\\%$ of random uncertainties. We then fit stellar population models to the decomposed SEDs (Spectral Energy Distribution) of bulges and disks and derive stellar masses (and stellar mass bulge-to-total ratios) as well as rest-frame colors (U,V,J) for bulges and disks separately. All data products are publicly released with this paper and through the web page https://lerma.obspm.fr/huertas/form\_CANDELS and will be used for scientific analysis in forthcoming works.},

  abstract      = {While major mergers have long been proposed as a driver of both AGN activity and the M-sigma relation, studies of moderate to high redshift Seyfert-luminosity AGN hosts have found little evidence for enhanced rates of interactions. However, both theory and observation suggest that while these AGN may be fueled by stochastic accretion and secular processes, high-luminosity, high-redshift, and heavily obscured AGN are the AGN most likely to be merger-driven. To better sample this population of AGN, we turn to infrared selection in the CANDELS/COSMOS field. Compared to their lower-luminosity and less obscured X-ray-only counterparts, IR-only AGN (luminous, heavily obscured AGN) are more likely to be classified as either irregular (50$^{+12}\_{-12}$\% vs. 9$^{+5}\_{-2}$\%) or asymmetric (69$^{+9}\_{-13}$\% vs. 17$^{+6}\_{-4}$\%) and are less likely to have a spheroidal component (31$^{+13}\_{-9}$\% vs. 77$^{+4}\_{-6}$\%). Furthermore, IR-only AGN are also significantly more likely than X-ray-only AGN (75$^{+8}\_{-13}$\% vs. 31$^{+6}\_{-6}$\%) to be classified either as interacting or merging in a way that significantly disturbs the host galaxy or disturbed though not clearly interacting or merging, which potentially represents the late stages of a major merger. This suggests that while major mergers may not contribute significantly to the fueling of Seyfert luminosity AGN, interactions appear to play a more dominant role in the triggering and fueling of high-luminosity heavily obscured AGN.},

  abstract      = {Studying giant star-forming clumps in distant galaxies is important to understand galaxy formation and evolution. At present, however, observers and theorists have not reached a consensus on whether the observed ``clumps'' in distant galaxies are the same phenomenon that is seen in simulations. In this paper, as a step to establish a benchmark of direct comparisons between observations and theories, we publish a sample of clumps constructed to represent the commonly observed ``clumps'' in the literature. This sample contains 3193 clumps detected from 1270 galaxies at $0.5 \leq z \lt 3.0$. The clumps are detected from rest-frame UV images, as described in our previous paper. Their physical properties, e.g., rest-frame color, stellar mass (M*), star formation rate (SFR), age, and dust extinction, are measured by fitting the spectral energy distribution (SED) to synthetic stellar population models. We carefully test the procedures of measuring clump properties, especially the method of subtracting background fluxes from the diffuse component of galaxies. With our fiducial background subtraction, we find a radial clump U-V color variation, where clumps close to galactic centers are redder than those in outskirts. The slope of the color gradient (clump color as a function of their galactocentric distance scaled by the semi-major axis of galaxies) changes with redshift and M* of the host galaxies: at a fixed M*, the slope becomes steeper toward low redshift, and at a fixed redshift, it becomes slightly steeper with M*. Based on our SED-fitting, this observed color gradient can be explained by a combination of a negative age gradient, a negative E(B-V) gradient, and a positive specific star formation rate gradient of the clumps. We also find that the color gradients of clumps are steeper than those of intra-clump regions. [Abridged]},

We use the Zurich ENvironmental Study (ZENS), which is a survey of galaxy groups with a large fraction of satellite galaxies. QGs shape a narrow locus in the $\Sigma\_1-M\_{\star}$ plane, which we refer to as $\Sigma\_1$ ridgeline. Colors of ($B-I$) and ($I-J$) are used to divide QGs into three age categories: young ($\lt2~\mathrm{Gyr}$), intermediate ($2-4~\mathrm{Gyr}$), and old ($\gt4~\mathrm{Gyr}$). At fixed stellar mass, old QGs on the $\Sigma\_1$ ridgeline have higher $\Sigma\_1$ than young QGs. This shows that galaxies landing on the $\Sigma\_1$ ridgeline at later epochs arrive with lower $\Sigma\_1$, which drives the zeropoint of the ridgeline down with time. We compare the present-day zeropoint of the oldest population at $z=0$ with the zeropoint of the quiescent population 4 Gyr back in time, at $z=0.37$. These zeropoints are identical, showing that the intrinsic evolution of individual galaxies after they arrive on the $\Sigma\_1$ ridgeline must be negligible, or must evolve parallel to the ridgeline during this interval. The observed evolution of the global zeropoint of 0.07 dex over the last 4 Gyr is thus largely due to the continuous addition of newly quenched galaxies with lower $\Sigma\_1$ at later times (``progenitor bias''). While these results refer to the satellite-rich ZENS sample as a whole, our work suggests a similar age-$\Sigma\_1$ trend for central galaxies.},

  abstract      = {The rest-frame UV-optical (i.e., $NUV-B$) color is sensitive to both low-level recent star formation (specific star formation rate - sSFR) and dust. In this Letter, we extend our previous work on the origins of $NUV-B$ color gradients in star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at $z\sim1$ to those at $z\sim2$. We use a sample of 1335 large (semi-major axis radius $R\_{\rm SMA}\gt0.''18$) SFGs with extended UV emission out to $2R\_{\rm SMA}$ in the mass range $M\_{\ast} = 10^{9}-10^{11}M\_{\odot}$ at $1.5\ltz\lt2.8$ in the CANDELS/GOODS-S and UDS fields. We show that these SFGs generally have negative $NUV-B$ color gradients (redder centres), and their color gradients strongly increase with galaxy mass. We also show that the global rest-frame $FUV-NUV$ color is approximately linear with $A\_{\rm V}$, which is derived by modeling the observed integrated FUV to NIR spectral energy distributions of the galaxies. Applying this integrated calibration to our spatially-resolved data, we find a negative dust gradient (more dust extinguished in the centers), which steadily becomes steeper with galaxy mass. We further find that the $NUV-B$ color gradients become nearly zero after correcting for dust gradients regardless of galaxy mass. This indicates that the sSFR gradients are negligible and dust reddening is likely the principal cause of negative UV-optical color gradients in these SFGs. Our findings support that the buildup of the stellar mass in SFGs at the Cosmic Noon is self-similar inside $2R\_{\rm SMA}$.},

We study galactic winds in the stacked spectrum of 560 AGN PSBs and that of a control sample of star-forming galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Using a two component (inter-stellar +wind) absorption-line model of the $\backslash$ion$\{$Na$\}$$\{$i$\}$ doublet, and after accounting for the stellar photospheric absorption, we find that the AGN PSBs have a centroid wind velocity shift of $-252^{+64}\_{-57}$ km s$^{-1}$ and a maximum blueshift velocity of $-678^{+54}\_{-53}$ km s$^{-1}$. In comparison, the control sample, which is matched with the AGN PSBs in redshift, stellar mass, axis-ratio, the 4000 $\{$$\backslash$AA$\}$ break index, Balmer decrement, and WISE 12 $\mu$m to 4.6 $\mu$m flux ratio, has a centroid wind velocity shift of $-119^{+33}\_{-41}$ km s$^{-1}$ and a maximum velocity of $-406^{+51}\_{-61}$ km s$^{-1}$.

Despite having a higher velocity, the observed winds in the AGN PSBs are still not powerful enough to sweep significant amounts of gas out of the halos of the host galaxies.

Measurements of galaxy rotation velocity $V\_{rot}$, which quantify ordered motions, and gas velocity dispersion $\sigma\_g$, which quantify disordered motions, are adopted from the DEEP2 and SIGMA surveys. This sample covers a continuous baseline in redshift from $z=2.5$ to $z=0.1$, spanning 10 Gyrs. At low redshift, nearly all sufficiently massive star-forming galaxies are rotationally supported ($V\_{rot}\gt\sigma\_g$). By $z=2$, the percentage of galaxies with rotational support has declined to 50$\\%$ at low stellar mass ($10^{9}-10^{10}\,M\_{\odot}$) and 70$\\%$ at high stellar mass ($10^{10}-10^{11}M\_{\odot}$). For $V\_{rot}\,\gt\,3\,\sigma\_g$, the percentage drops below 35$\\%$ for all masses. From $z\,=\,2$ to now, galaxies exhibit remarkably smooth kinematic evolution on average. All galaxies tend towards rotational support with time, and it is reached earlier in higher mass systems. This is mostly due to an average decline in $\sigma\_g$ by a factor of 3 since a redshift of 2, which is independent of mass. Over the same time period, $V\_{rot}$ increases by a factor of 1.5 for low mass systems, but does not evolve for high mass systems. These trends in $V\_{rot}$ and $\sigma\_g$ with time are at a fixed stellar mass and should not be interpreted as evolutionary tracks for galaxy populations. When galaxy populations are linked in time with abundance matching, not only does $\sigma\_g$ decline with time as before, but $V\_{rot}$ strongly increases with time for all galaxy masses. This enhances the evolution in $V\_{rot}/\sigma\_g$. These results indicate that $z\,=\,2$ is a period of disk assembly, during which the strong rotational support present in today's massive disk galaxies is only just beginning to emerge.},

We use CANDELS data to test $\{$$\backslash$it whether or not$\}$ such a dwarf QG--massive central galaxy connection exists beyond the local universe. To this purpose, we only need a statistically representative, rather than a complete, sample of low-mass galaxies, which enables our study to $z\gtrsim1.5$. For each low-mass galaxy, we measure the projected distance ($d\_{proj}$) to its nearest massive neighbor (M*$\gt10^{10.5} M\_\odot$) within a redshift range. At a given redshift and M*, the environmental quenching effect is considered to be observed if the $d\_{proj}$ distribution of QGs ($d\_{proj}^Q$) is significantly skewed toward lower values than that of star-forming galaxies ($d\_{proj}^{SF}$). For galaxies with $10^{8} M\_\odot \lt M* \lt 10^{10} M\_\odot$, such a difference between $d\_{proj}^Q$ and $d\_{proj}^{SF}$ is detected up to $z\sim1$. Also, about 10$\backslash$\% of the quenched galaxies in our sample are located between two and four virial radii ($R\_{Vir}$) of the massive halos. The median projected distance from low-mass QGs to their massive neighbors, $d\_{proj}^Q / R\_{Vir}$, decreases with satellite M* at $M* \lesssim 10^{9.5} M\_\odot$, but increases with satellite M* at $M* \gtrsim 10^{9.5} M\_\odot$.

This sample complements previous samples of PSBs by including green valley PSBs with Seyfert-like emission, allowing us to analyze for the first time the molecular gas properties of 116 PSBs with a variety of AGN properties. The distribution of molecular gas to stellar mass fractions in PSBs is significantly different than normal star-forming galaxies in the COLD GASS survey. The combined samples of PSBs with Seyfert-like emission line ratios have a gas fraction distribution which is even more significantly different and is broader (\~{} 0.03-0.3). Most of them have lower gas fractions than normal star-forming galaxies. We find a highly significant correlation between the WISE 12 micron to 4.6 micron flux ratios and molecular gas fractions in both PSBs and normal galaxies.

There is a strong ISM component in Fe II 2586 absorption with (1.2, 1.5, 0.8) Angstrom, implying presence of substantial amount cold gas in the host galaxies. For comparison, star-forming and X-ray undetected galaxies at a similar redshift, matched roughly in stellar mass and galaxy inclination, have a centroid velocity PDF with percentiles of (-74, -258, +90) km/s, and a velocity dispersion PDF percentiles of (150, 259, 57) km/s. Thus, winds in the AGN are similar to star-formation-driven winds, and are too weak to escape and expel substantial cool gas from galaxies. Our sample doubles the previous sample of AGN studied at z \~{} 0.5 and extends the analysis to z \~{} 1. A joint reanalysis of the z \~{} 0.5 AGN sample and our sample yields consistent results to the measurements above.},

  abstract      = {We present new determinations of the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) at $z=0-10$ that match the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function, the SFR$-M\_*$ relation,and the cosmic star formation rate. We utilize a compilation of 40 observational studies from the literature and correct them for potential biases. Using our robust determinations of halo mass assembly and the SHMR, we infer star formation histories, merger rates, and structural properties for average galaxies, combining star-forming and quenched galaxies. Our main findings: (1) The halo mass $M\_{50}$ above which 50$\backslash$\% of galaxies are quenched coincides with sSFR/sMAR$\sim1$, where sMAR is the specific halo mass accretion rate. (2) $M\_{50}$ increases with redshift, presumably due to cold streams being more efficient at high redshift while virial shocks and AGN feedback become more relevant at lower redshifts. (3) The ratio sSFR/sMAR has a peak value, which occurs around $M\_{\rm vir}\sim2\times10^{11}M\_{\odot}$. (4) The stellar mass density within 1 kpc, $\Sigma\_1$, is a good indicator of the galactic global sSFR. (5) Galaxies are statistically quenched after they reach a maximum in $\Sigma\_1$, consistent with theoretical expectations of the gas compaction model; this maximum depends on redshift. (6) In-situ star formation is responsible for most galactic stellar mass growth, especially for lower-mass galaxies. (7) Galaxies grow inside out. The marked change in the slope of the size--mass relation when galaxies became quenched, from $d\log R\_{\rm eff}/d\log M\_*\sim0.35$ to $\sim2.5$, could be the result of dry minor mergers.},

  abstract      = {The reionization of the Universe is one of the most important topics of present day astrophysical research. The most plausible candidates for the reionization process are star-forming galaxies, which according to the predictions of the majority of the theoretical and semi-analytical models should dominate the HI ionizing background at z\~{}3. We aim at measuring the Lyman continuum escape fraction, which is one of the key parameters to compute the contribution of star-forming galaxies to the UV background. We have used ultra-deep U-band imaging (U=30.2mag at 1sigma) by LBC/LBT in the CANDELS/GOODS-North field, as well as deep imaging in COSMOS and EGS fields, in order to estimate the Lyman continuum escape fraction of 69 star-forming galaxies with secure spectroscopic redshifts at 3.27$\lt$z$\lt$3.40 to faint magnitude limits (L=0.2L*, or equivalently M1500\~{}-19). We have measured through stacks a stringent upper limit ($\lt$1.7\% at 1sigma) for the relative escape fraction of HI ionizing photons from bright galaxies (L$\gt$L*), while for the faint population (L=0.2L*) the limit to the escape fraction is \~{}10\%. We have computed the contribution of star-forming galaxies to the observed UV background at z\~{}3 and we have found that it is not enough to keep the Universe ionized at these redshifts, unless their escape fraction increases significantly ($\gt$10\%) at low luminosities (M1500$\gt$-19). We compare our results on the Lyman continuum escape fraction of high-z galaxies with recent estimates in the literature and discuss future prospects to shed light on the end of the Dark Ages. In the future, strong gravitational lensing will be fundamental to measure the Lyman continuum escape fraction down to faint magnitudes (M1500\~{}-16) which are inaccessible with the present instrumentation on blank fields.},

  abstract      = {We explore empirical constraints on the statistical relationship between the radial size of galaxies and the radius of their host dark matter halos from $z\sim 0.1$--3 using the GAMA and CANDELS surveys. We map dark matter halo mass to galaxy stellar mass using relationships from abundance matching, applied to the Bolshoi-Planck dissipationless N-body simulation. We define SRHR$\equiv r\_e/R\_h$ as the ratio of galaxy radius to halo virial radius, and SRHR$\lambda \equiv r\_e/(\lambda R\_h)$ as the ratio of galaxy radius to halo spin parameter times halo radius. At $z\sim 0.1$, we find an average value of SRHR $\simeq 0.018$ and SRHR$\lambda \simeq 0.5$ with very little dependence on stellar mass. SRHR and SRHR$\lambda$ have a weak dependence on cosmic time since $z\sim 3$. SRHR shows a mild decrease over cosmic time for low mass galaxies, but increases slightly or does not evolve for more massive galaxies. We find hints that at high redshift ($z\sim 2$--3), SRHR$\lambda$ is lower for more massive galaxies, while it shows no significant dependence on stellar mass at $z\lesssim 0.5$. We find that for both the GAMA and CANDELS samples, at all redshifts from $z\sim 0.1$--3, the observed conditional size distribution in stellar mass bins is remarkably similar to the conditional distribution of $\lambda R\_h$. We discuss the physical interpretation and implications of these results.},

  abstract      = {We present quantified visual morphologies of approximately 48,000 galaxies observed in three Hubble Space Telescope legacy fields by the Cosmic And Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) and classified by participants in the Galaxy Zoo project. 90\% of galaxies have z $\lt$ 3 and are observed in rest-frame optical wavelengths by CANDELS. Each galaxy received an average of 40 independent classifications, which we combine into detailed morphological information on galaxy features such as clumpiness, bar instabilities, spiral structure, and merger and tidal signatures. We apply a consensus-based classifier weighting method that preserves classifier independence while effectively down-weighting significantly outlying classifications. After analysing the effect of varying image depth on reported classifications, we also provide depth-corrected classifications which both preserve the information in the deepest observations and also enable the use of classifications at comparable depths across the full survey. Comparing the Galaxy Zoo classifications to previous classifications of the same galaxies shows very good agreement; for some applications the high number of independent classifications provided by Galaxy Zoo provides an advantage in selecting galaxies with a particular morphological profile, while in others the combination of Galaxy Zoo with other classifications is a more promising approach than using any one method alone. We combine the Galaxy Zoo classifications of ``smooth'' galaxies with parametric morphologies to select a sample of featureless disks at 1 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3, which may represent a dynamically warmer progenitor population to the settled disk galaxies seen at later epochs.},

  abstract      = {Although there has been much progress in understanding how galaxies evolve, we still do not understand how and when they stop forming stars and become quiescent. We address this by applying our galaxy spectral energy distribution models, which incorporate physically motivated star formation histories (SFHs) from cosmological simulations, to a sample of quiescent galaxies at $0.2\ltz\lt2.1$. A total of 845 quiescent galaxies with multi-band photometry spanning rest-frame ultraviolet through near-infrared wavelengths are selected from the CANDELS dataset. We compute median SFHs of these galaxies in bins of stellar mass and redshift. At all redshifts and stellar masses, the median SFHs rise, reach a peak, and then decline to reach quiescence. At high redshift, we find that the rise and decline are fast, as expected because the Universe is young. At low redshift, the duration of these phases depends strongly on stellar mass. Low-mass galaxies ($\log(M\_{\ast}/M\_{\odot})\sim9.5$) grow on average slowly, take a long time to reach their peak of star formation ($\gtrsim 4$ Gyr), and the declining phase is fast ($\lesssim 2$ Gyr). Conversely, high-mass galaxies ($\log(M\_{\ast}/M\_{\odot})\sim11$) grow on average fast ($\lesssim 2$ Gyr), and, after reaching their peak, decrease the star formation slowly ($\gtrsim 3$ Gyr). These findings are consistent with galaxy stellar mass being a driving factor in determining how evolved galaxies are, with high-mass galaxies being the most evolved at any time (i.e., downsizing). The different durations we observe in the declining phases also suggest that low- and high-mass galaxies experience different quenching mechanisms that operate on different timescales.},

  abstract      = {Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we adopt the sSFR-$\Sigma\_{1kpc}$ diagram as a diagnostic tool to understand quenching in different environments. sSFR is the specific star formation rate, and $\Sigma\_{1kpc}$ is the stellar surface density in the inner kpc. Although both the host halo mass and group-centric distance affect the satellite population, we find that these can be characterised by a single number, the quenched fraction, such that key features of the sSFR-$\Sigma\_{1kpc}$ diagram vary smoothly with this proxy for the ``environment''. Particularly, the sSFR of star-forming galaxies decreases smoothly with this quenched fraction, the sSFR of satellites being 0.1 dex lower than in the field. Furthermore, $\Sigma\_{1kpc}$ of the transition galaxies (i.e., the ``green valley'' or GV) decreases smoothly with the environment, by as much as 0.2 dex for $M\_* = 10^{9.75-10} M\_{\odot}$ from the field, and decreasing for satellites in larger halos and at smaller radial distances within same-mass halos. We interpret this shift as indicating the relative importance of today's field quenching track vs. the cluster quenching track. These environmental effects in the sSFR-$\Sigma\_{1kpc}$ diagram are most significant in our lowest mass range ($9.75 \lt \log M\_{*}/M\_{\odot} \lt 10$). One feature that is shared between all environments is that at a given $M\_{*}$ quenched galaxies have about 0.2-0.3 dex higher $\Sigma\_{1kpc}$ than the star-forming population. These results indicate that either $\Sigma\_{1kpc}$ increases (subsequent to satellite quenching), or $\Sigma\_{1kpc}$ for individual galaxies remains unchanged, but the original $M\_*$ or the time of quenching is significantly different from those now in the GV.},

  abstract      = {[abridged] We quantify the evolution of the stellar mass functions of star-forming and quiescent galaxies as a function of morphology from $z\sim 3$ to the present. Our sample consists of \~{}50,000 galaxies in the CANDELS fields ($\sim880$ $arcmin^2$), which we divide into four main morphological types, i.e. pure bulge dominated systems, pure spiral disk dominated, intermediate 2-component bulge+disk systems and irregular disturbed galaxies. Our main results are: Star-formation: At $z\sim 2$, 80$\backslash$\% of the stellar mass density of star-forming galaxies is in irregular systems. However, by $z\sim 0.5$, irregular objects only dominate at stellar masses below $10^9M\odot$. A majority of the star-forming irregulars present at $z\sim 2$ undergo a gradual transformation from disturbed to normal spiral disk morphologies by $z\sim 1$ without significant interruption to their star-formation. Rejuvenation after a quenching event does not seem to be common except perhaps for the most massive objects. Quenching: We confirm that galaxies reaching a stellar mass of $M\_*\sim10^{10.8}M\_\odot$ ($M^*$) tend to quench. Also, quenching implies the presence of a bulge: the abundance of massive red disks is negligible at all redshifts over 2\~{}dex in stellar mass. However the dominant quenching mechanism evolves. At $z\gt2$, the SMF of quiescent galaxies above $M^*$ is dominated by compact spheroids. Quenching at this early epoch destroys the disk and produces a compact remnant unless the star-forming progenitors at even higher redshifts are significantly more dense. At $1\ltz\lt2$, the majority of newly quenched galaxies are disks with a significant central bulge. This suggests that mass-quenching at this epoch starts from the inner parts and preserves the disk. At $z\lt1$, the high mass end of the passive SMF is globally in place and the evolution mostly happens at stellar masses below $10^{10}M\_\odot$.},

With this sample, we study the origin of UV-optical color gradients in the SFGs at z\~{}1 and discuss their link with the buildup of stellar mass. We find that the more massive, centrally compact, and more dust extinguished SFGs tend to have statistically more negative raw color gradients (redder centers) than the less massive, centrally diffuse, and less dusty SFGs. After correcting for dust reddening based on optical-SED fitting, the color gradients in the low-mass ($M\_{\ast} \lt10^{10}M\_{\odot}$) SFGs generally become quite flat, while most of the high-mass ($M\_{\ast} \gt 10^{10.5}M\_{\odot}$) SFGs still retain shallow negative color gradients. These findings imply that dust reddening is likely the principal cause of negative color gradients in the low-mass SFGs, while both increased central dust reddening and buildup of compact old bulges are likely the origins of negative color gradients in the high-mass SFGs. These findings also imply that at these redshifts the low-mass SFGs buildup their stellar masses in a self-similar way, while the high-mass SFGs grow inside out.},

Our sample contains 164 galaxies down to stellar mass (M*) of $10^{8.5} M\_\odot$ in the CANDELS GOODS-N region, where Team Keck Redshift Survey DEIMOS spectroscopy and HST/WFC3 F275W images from CANDELS and Hubble Deep UV Legacy Survey are available. When the $\{$$\backslash$it ratio$\}$ of H$\beta$- and FUV-derived SFRs is measured, dust extinction correction is negligible (except for very dusty galaxies) with the Calzetti attenuation curve. The H$\beta$--to--FUV ratio of our sample increases with M* and SFR. The median ratio is $\sim$0.7 at M*$\sim10^{8.5} M\_\odot$ (or SFR$\sim 0.5 M\_\odot/yr$) and increases to $\sim$1 at M*$\sim10^{10} M\_\odot$ (or SFR $\sim 10 M\_\odot/yr$). At M*$\lt10^{9.5} M\_\odot$, our median H$\beta$--to--FUV ratio is lower than that of local galaxies at the same M*, implying a redshift evolution. Bursty SFH on a timescale of a few tens of megayears on galactic scales provides a plausible explanation of our results, and the importance of the burstiness increases as M* decreases. Due to sample selection effects, our H$\beta$--to--FUV ratio may be an upper limit of the true value of a complete sample, which strengthens our conclusions. Other models, e.g., non-universal initial mass function or stochastic star formation on star cluster scales, are unable to plausibly explain our results.},

For masses below $10^9 M\_\odot$, our sample of 237 galaxies is $\sim$10 times larger than those in previous studies beyond the local universe. This huge gain in sample size enables superior constraints on the MZR and its scatter in the low-mass regime. We find a power-law MZR at $10^{8} M\_\odot \lt M\_{*} \lt 10^{11} M\_\odot$: ${12+log(O/H) = (5.83\pm0.19) + (0.30\pm0.02)log(M\_{*}/M\_\odot)}$. Our MZR shows good agreement with others measured at similar redshifts in the literature in the intermediate and massive regimes, but is shallower than the extrapolation of the MZRs of others to masses below $10^{9} M\_\odot$. The SFR dependence of the MZR in our sample is weaker than that found for local galaxies (known as the Fundamental Metallicity Relation). Compared to a variety of theoretical models, the slope of our MZR for low-mass galaxies agrees well with predictions incorporating supernova energy-driven winds. Being robust against currently uncertain metallicity calibrations, the scatter of the MZR serves as a powerful diagnostic of the stochastic history of gas accretion, gas recycling, and star formation of low-mass galaxies. Our major result is that the scatter of our MZR increases as $M\_{*}$ decreases. Our result implies that either the scatter of the baryonic accretion rate or the scatter of the $M\_{*}$--$M\_{halo}$ relation increases as $M\_{*}$ decreases. Moreover, our measures of scatter at $z=0.7$ appears consistent with that found for local galaxies.},

  abstract      = {We present the first public release of photometric redshifts, galaxy rest-frame properties and associated magnification values in the cluster and parallel pointings of the first two Frontier Fields, Abell-2744 and MACS-J0416. We exploit a multi-wavelength catalogue ranging from HST to ground-based K and Spitzer IRAC which is specifically designed to enable detection and measurement of accurate fluxes in crowded cluster regions. The multi-band information is used to derive photometric redshifts and physical properties of sources detected either in the H-band image alone or from a stack of four WFC3 bands. To minimize systematics median photometric redshifts are assembled from six different approaches to photo-z estimates. Their reliability is assessed through a comparison with available spectroscopic samples. State of the art lensing models are used to derive magnification values on an object-by-object basis by taking into account sources positions and redshifts. We show that photometric redshifts reach a remarkable \~{}3-5\% accuracy. After accounting for magnification the H band number counts are found in agreement at bright magnitudes with number counts from the CANDELS fields, while extending the presently available samples to galaxies intrinsically as faint as H160\~{}32-33 thanks to strong gravitational lensing. The Frontier Fields allow to probe the galaxy stellar mass distribution at 0.5-1.5 dex lower masses, depending on magnification, with respect to extragalactic wide fields, including sources at Mstar\~{} 10\^{}7-10\^{}8 Msun at z$\gt$5. Similarly, they allow the detection of objects with intrinsic SFRs$\gt$1dex lower than in the CANDELS fields reaching 0.1-1 Msun/yr at z\~{}6-10. [abridged]},

  abstract      = {We present multiwavelength photometric catalogues (HST, Spitzer and Hawk-I K band) for the first two of the Frontier Fields, Abell2744 and MACSJ0416 (plus their parallel fields). To detect faint sources even in the central regions of the clusters, we develop a robust and repeatable procedure that uses the public codes Galapagos and Galfit to model and remove most of the light contribution from both the brightest cluster members as well as the ICL. We perform the detection on the HST H160 processed image to obtain a pure H-selected sample. We also add a sample of sources which are undetected in the H160 image but appear on a stacked infrared image. Photometry in the other HST bands is obtained using SExtractor, performed again on residual images after the Galfit procedure for foreground light removal. Photometry on the Hawk-I and IRAC bands has been obtained using our PSF-matching deconfusion code T-PHOT. A similar procedure, but without the need for the foreground light removal, is adopted for the Parallel fields. The procedure allows for the detection and the photometric measurements of \~{}2500 sources per field. We deliver and release complete photometric H-detected catalogues, with the addition of a complementary sample of infrared-detected sources. All objects have multiwavelength coverage including B to H HST bands, plus K band from Hawk-I, and 3.6 - 4.5 $\{$$\backslash$mu$\}$m from Spitzer. Full and detailed treatment of photometric errors is included. We perform basic sanity checks on the reliability of our results. The multiwavelength catalogues are publicly available and are ready to be used for scientific purposes. Our procedures allows for the detection of outshined objects near the bright galaxies, which, coupled with the magnification effect of the clusters, can reveal extremely faint high redshift sources. Full analysis on photometric redshifts is presented in a companion Paper II. [abridged]},

Several evolutionary models have been proposed for the formation of Type-III S0 galaxies but the observations of are usually limited to the local Universe. We study the evolution of the photometric and structural scaling relations found between the parameters of the surface brightness profiles in the rest-frame R-band of Type-III S0 galaxies with z and the possible differences between the rest-frame (B-R) colours of the inner and outer disc profiles. We make use of a sample of 14 Type-III E/S0--S0 galaxies at 0.2$\lt$z$\lt$0.6 to study if the correlations found in local Type-III S0 galaxies were present \~{}6 Gyr ago. We analyse the distribution of the surface brightness characteristic parameters as a function of the stellar mass and if there is a significant change with z. We also derive their rest-frame (B-R) colour profiles and we compare these results with the predictions from a grid of SSP models. We find that the inner and outer scale-lengths of Type-III S0 galaxies at 0.4$\lt$z$\lt$0.6 follow compatible trends and scaling relations with those observed in local S0 galaxies. We do not detect any significant differences between the location of Rbreak between z\~{}0.6 and z=0 for a fixed stellar mass of the object, whereas the surface brightness at the break radius is \~{}1.5 mag arcsec-2 dimmer in the local Universe than at z\~{}0.6 for a fixed stellar mass. In contrast to Type-II profiles, the Type-III surface brightness profiles of S0 galaxies present compatible Rbreak values and scaling relations during the last 6 Gyr. This result and the similarity of the colours of the inner and outer discs point to a highly scalable and stable formation process, probably more related to gravitational and dynamical processes than to the evolution of stellar populations (abridged).},

  abstract      = {The rate of major galaxy-galaxy merging is theoretically predicted to steadily increase with redshift during the peak epoch of massive galaxy development ($1{\leq}z{\leq}3$). We use close-pair statistics to objectively study the incidence of massive galaxies (stellar $M\_{1}{\geq}2{\times}10^{10}M\_{\odot}$) hosting major companions ($1{\leq}M\_{1}/M\_{2}{\leq}4$; i.e., $\lt$4:1) at six epochs spanning $0{\lt}z{\lt}3$. We select companions from a nearly complete, mass-limited ($\geq5{\times}10^{9}M\_{\odot}$) sample of 23,696 galaxies in the five CANDELS fields and the SDSS. Using $5-50$ kpc projected separation and close redshift proximity criteria, we find that the major companion fraction $f\_{\mathrm{mc}}(z)$ based on stellar mass-ratio (MR) selection increases from 6\% ($z{\sim}0$) to 16\% ($z{\sim}0.8$), then turns over at $z{\sim}1$ and decreases to 7\% ($z{\sim}3$). Instead, if we use a major F160W flux ratio (FR) selection, we find that $f\_{\mathrm{mc}}(z)$ increases steadily until $z=3$ owing to increasing contamination from minor (MR$\gt$4:1) companions at $z\gt1$. We show that these evolutionary trends are statistically robust to changes in companion proximity. We find disagreements between published results are resolved when selection criteria are closely matched. If we compute merger rates using constant fraction-to-rate conversion factors ($C\_{\mathrm{merg,pair}}{=}0.6$ and $T\_{\mathrm{obs,pair}}{=}0.65\mathrm{Gyr}$), we find that MR rates disagree with theoretical predictions at $z{\gt}1.5$. Instead, if we use an evolving $T\_{\mathrm{obs,pair}}(z){\propto}(1+z)^{-2}$ from Snyder et al., our MR-based rates agree with theory at $0{\lt}z{\lt}3$. Our analysis underscores the need for detailed calibration of $C\_{\mathrm{merg,pair}}$ and $T\_{\mathrm{obs,pair}}$ as a function of redshift, mass and companion selection criteria to better constrain the empirical major merger history.},

Kinematics (rotation velocity $V\_{rot}$ and integrated gas velocity dispersion $\sigma\_g$) are measured from nebular emission lines which trace the hot ionized gas surrounding star-forming regions. We find that by z$\,\sim\,$2, massive star-forming galaxies ($\log\,M\_*/M\_{\odot}\gtrsim10.2$) have assembled primitive disks: their kinematics are dominated by rotation, they are consistent with a marginally stable disk model, and they form a Tully-Fisher relation. These massive galaxies have values of $V\_{rot}/\sigma\_g$ which are factors of 2-5 lower than local well-ordered galaxies at similar masses. Such results are consistent with findings by other studies. We find that low mass galaxies ($\log\,M\_*/M\_{\odot}\lesssim10.2$) at this epoch are still in the early stages of disk assembly: their kinematics are often supported by gas velocity dispersion and they fall from the Tully-Fisher relation to significantly low values of $V\_{rot}$. This ``kinematic downsizing'' implies that the process(es) responsible for disrupting disks at z$\,\sim\,$2 have a stronger effect and/or are more active in low mass systems. In conclusion, we find that the period of rapid stellar mass growth at z$\,\sim\,$2 is coincident with the nascent assembly of low mass disks and the assembly and settling of high mass disks.},

We utilize photometry in the Hubble Ultradeep Field (HUDF12), Ultraviolet Ultra Deep Field (UVUDF) campaigns and CANDELS/GOODS-S. We estimate SFR, M* from broadband Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) and the best available redshifts. The maximum depth of the HUDF photometry (F160W 29.9 AB, 5 sigma depth) probes the SFR-M* correlation down to M* \~{} 10 \^{}7 Msun, a factor of 10-100X lower in M* than previous studies, and comparable to dwarf galaxies in the local universe. We find the slope of the SFR-M* relationship to be near unity at all redshifts and the normalization to decrease with cosmic time. We find a moderate increase in intrinsic scatter with cosmic time from 0.2 to 0.4 dex across the epoch of peak cosmic star formation. None of our redshift bins show a statistically significant increase in intrinsic scatter at low mass. However, it remains possible that intrinsic scatter increases at low mass on timescales shorter than \~{} 100 Myr. Our results are consistent with a picture of gradual and self-similar assembly of galaxies across more than three orders of magnitude in stellar mass from as low as 10\^{}7 Msun.},

The new selection is based on the H\_$\{$160$\}$ and IRAC 4.5um bands, specifically H - [4.5] $\gt$ 2.25 mag. These galaxies, dubbed ``HIEROs'', include two major populations that can be separated with an additional J - H color. The populations are massive and dusty star-forming galaxies at z $\gt$ 3 (JH-blue) and extremely dusty galaxies at z $\lt$ 3 (JH-red). The 350 arcmin\^{}2 of the GOODS-N and GOODS-S fields with the deepest HST/WFC3 and IRAC data contain 285 HIEROs down to [4.5] $\lt$ 24 mag. We focus here primarily on JH-blue (z $\gt$ 3) HIEROs, which have a median photometric redshift z \~{}4.4 and stellar massM\_$\{$*$\}$\~{}10\^{}$\{$10.6$\}$ Msun, and are much fainter in the rest-frame UV than similarly massive Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs). Their star formation rates (SFRs) reaches \~{}240 Msun yr\^{}$\{$-1$\}$ leading to a specific SFR, sSFR \~{}4.2 Gyr\^{}$\{$-1$\}$, suggesting that the sSFRs for massive galaxies continue to grow at z $\gt$ 2 but at a lower growth rate than from z=0 to z=2. With a median half-light radius of 2 kpc, including \~{}20\% as compact as quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts, JH-blue HIEROs represent perfect star-forming progenitors of the most massive (M\_$\{$*$\}$ $\gt$ 10\^{}$\{$11.2$\}$ Msun) compact quiescent galaxies at z \~{} 3 and have the right number density. HIEROs make up \~{}60\% of all galaxies with M\_$\{$*$\}$ $\gt$ 10\^{}$\{$10.5$\}$ Msun identified at z $\gt$ 3 from their photometric redshifts. This is five times more than LBGs with nearly no overlap between the two populations. While HIEROs make up 15-25\% of the total SFR density at z \~{} 4-5, they completely dominate the SFR density taking place in M\_$\{$*$\}$ $\gt$10\^{}$\{$10.5$\}$ Msun galaxies, and are therefore crucial to understanding the very early phase of massive galaxy formation.},

The TKRS2 project targets 97 galaxies drawn from samples that include z\~{}2 emission-line galaxies with features observable in the JHK bands as well as lower-redshift targets with features in the Y band. We present a detailed measurement of MOSFIRE's sensitivity as a function of wavelength, including the effects of telluric features across the YJHK filters. The largest utility of our survey is in providing rest-frame-optical emission lines for z$\gt$1 galaxies, and we demonstrate that the ratios of strong, optical emission lines of z\~{}2 galaxies suggest the presence of either higher N/O abundances than are found in z\~{}0 galaxies or low-metallicity gas ionized by an active galactic nucleus. We have released all TKRS2 data products into the public domain to allow researchers access to representative raw and reduced MOSFIRE spectra.},

The algorithm is trained on GOODS-S for which visual classifications are publicly available and then applied to the other 4 fields. Following the CANDELS main morphology classification scheme, our model retrieves the probabilities for each galaxy of having a spheroid, a disk, presenting an irregularity, being compact or point source and being unclassifiable. ConvNets are able to predict the fractions of votes given a galaxy image with zero bias and $\sim10\\%$ scatter. The fraction of miss-classifications is less than $1\\%$. Our classification scheme represents a major improvement with respect to CAS (Concentration-Asymmetry-Smoothness)-based methods, which hit a $20-30\\%$ contamination limit at high z.

  abstract      = {We examine the host morphologies of heavily obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) at $z\sim1$ to test whether obscured supermassive black hole growth at this epoch is preferentially linked to galaxy mergers. Our sample consists of 154 obscured AGN with $N\_{\rm H}\gt10^{23.5}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $z\lt1.5$. Using visual classifications, we compare the morphologies of these AGN to control samples of moderately obscured ($10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ $\ltN\_{\rm H}\lt 10^{23.5}$ cm$^{-2}$) and unobscured ($N\_{\rm H}\lt10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) AGN. These control AGN are matched in redshift and intrinsic X-ray luminosity to our heavily obscured AGN. We find that heavily obscured AGN at z\~{}1 are twice as likely to be hosted by late-type galaxies relative to unobscured AGN ($65.3^{+4.1}\_{-4.6}\\%$ vs $34.5^{+2.9}\_{-2.7}\\%$) and three times as likely to exhibit merger or interaction signatures ($21.5^{+4.2}\_{-3.3}\\%$ vs $7.8^{+1.9}\_{-1.3}\\%$). The increased merger fraction is significant at the 3.8$\sigma$ level. We also find that the incidence of point-like morphologies is inversely proportional to obscuration. If we exclude all point sources and consider only extended hosts, we find the correlation between merger fraction and obscuration is still evident, however at a reduced statistical significance ($2.5\sigma$). The fact that we observe a different disk/spheroid fraction versus obscuration indicates that viewing angle cannot be the only thing differentiating our three AGN samples, as a simple unification model would suggest. The increased fraction of disturbed morphologies with obscuration supports an evolutionary scenario, in which Compton-thick AGN are a distinct phase of obscured SMBH growth following a merger/interaction event. Our findings also suggest that some of the merger-triggered SMBH growth predicted by recent AGN fueling models may be hidden among the heavily obscured, Compton-thick population.},

  abstract      = {We study the evolution of the core (r$\lt$1 kpc) and effective (r$\lt$r\_e) stellar-mass surface densities, in star-forming and quiescent galaxies. Since z=3, both populations occupy distinct, linear relations in log(Sigma\_e) and log(Sigma\_1) vs. log(M). These structural relations exhibit slopes and scatter that remain almost constant with time while their normalizations decline. For SFGs, the normalization declines by less than a factor of 2 from z=3, in both Sigma\_e and Sigma\_1. Such mild declines suggest that SFGs build dense cores by growing along these relations. We define this evolution as the structural main sequence (Sigma-MS). Quiescent galaxies follow different relations (Sigma\^{}Q\_e, Sigma\^{}Q\_1) off the Sigma-MS by having higher densities than SFGs of the same mass and redshift. The normalization of Sigma\^{}Q\_e declines by a factor of 10 since z=3, but only a factor of 2 in Sigma\^{}Q\_1. Thus, the common denominator for quiescent galaxies at all redshifts is the presence of a dense stellar core, and the formation of such cores in SFGs is the main requirement for quenching. Expressed in 2D as deviations off the SFR-MS and off Sigma\^{}Q\_1 at each redshift, the distribution of massive galaxies forms a universal, L-shaped sequence that relates two fundamental physical processes: compaction and quenching. Compaction is a process of substantial core-growth in SFGs relative to that in the Sigma-MS. This process increases the core-to-total mass and Sersic index, thereby, making compact SFGs. Quenching occurs once compact SFGs reach a maximum central density above Sigma\^{}Q\_1 $\gt$ 9.5 M\_sun/kpc\^{}2. This threshold provides the most effective selection criterion to identify the star-forming progenitors of quiescent galaxies at all redshifts.},

By splitting our sample by redshift, we can use the fixed size of the SDSS fiber to model the stellar populations at different radii within galaxies. At 0.02$\lt$z$\lt$0.04, the SDSS fiber radius corresponds to \~{}1 kpc, which is the typical half-light radii of both classical bulges and disky pseudobulges. Assuming that the SDSS fiber primarily covers the bulges at these redshifts, our analysis shows that there are no significant differences in the stellar populations, i.e., stellar age, [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], and [N/Fe], of the bulges of barred vs. unbarred quiescent disk galaxies. Modeling the stellar populations at different redshift intervals from z=0.020 to z=0.085 at fixed stellar masses produces an estimate of the stellar population gradients out to about half the typical effective radius of our sample, assuming null evolution over this \~{}1 Gyr epoch. We find that there are no noticeable differences in the slopes of the azimuthally averaged gradients of barred vs. unbarred quiescent disk galaxies. These results suggest that bars are not a strong influence on the chemical evolution of quiescent disk galaxies.},

This is currently the third deepest X-ray survey in existence, a factor $\sim 2-3$ shallower than the Chandra Deep Fields (CDFs) but over an area $\sim 3$ times greater than each CDF. We present a catalogue of 937 point sources detected in the deep $\backslash$chandra$\backslash$ observations. We present identifications of our X-ray sources from deep ground-based, Spitzer, GALEX and HST imaging. Using a likelihood ratio analysis, we associate multi band counterparts for 929/937 of our X-ray sources, with an estimated 95\~{}$\backslash$\% reliability, making the identification completeness approximately 94\~{}$\backslash$\% in a statistical sense. Reliable spectroscopic redshifts for 353 of our X-ray sources are provided predominantly from Keck (DEEP2/3) and MMT Hectospec, so the current spectroscopic completeness is $\sim 38$\~{}per cent. For the remainder of the X-ray sources, we compute photometric redshifts based on multi-band photometry in up to 35 bands from the UV to mid-IR. Particular attention is given to the fact that the vast majority the X-ray sources are AGN and require hybrid templates. Our photometric redshifts have mean accuracy of $\sigma=0.04$ and an outlier fraction of approximately 5$\backslash$\%, reaching $\sigma=0.03$ with less than 4$\backslash$\% outliers in the area covered by CANDELS .

  abstract      = {We use data from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey to study how the spatial variation in the stellar populations of galaxies relate to the formation of galaxies at $1.5 \lt z \lt 3.5$. We use the Internal Color Dispersion (ICD), measured between the rest-frame UV and optical bands, which is sensitive to age (and dust attenuation) variations in stellar populations. The ICD shows a relation with the stellar masses and morphologies of the galaxies. Galaxies with the largest variation in their stellar populations as evidenced by high ICD have disk-dominated morphologies (with S$\backslash$'$\{$e$\}$rsic indexes $\lt 2$) and stellar masses between $10 \lt \mathrm{Log~M/ M\_\odot}\lt 11$. There is a marked decrease in the ICD as the stellar mass and/or the S$\backslash$'ersic index increases. By studying the relations between the ICD and other galaxy properties including sizes, total colors, star-formation rate, and dust attenuation, we conclude that the largest variations in stellar populations occur in galaxies where the light from newly, high star-forming clumps contrasts older stellar disk populations. This phase reaches a peak for galaxies only with a specific stellar mass range, $10 \lt \mathrm{Log~M/ M\_\odot} \lt 11$, and prior to the formation of a substantial bulge/spheroid. In contrast, galaxies at higher or lower stellar masses, and/or higher S$\backslash$'$\{$e$\}$rsic index ($n \gt 2$) show reduced ICD values, implying a greater homogeneity of their stellar populations. This indicates that if a galaxy is to have both a quiescent bulge along with a star forming disk, typical of Hubble Sequence galaxies, this is most common for stellar masses $10 \lt \mathrm{Log~M/M\_\odot} \lt 11$ and when the bulge component remains relatively small ($n\lt2$).},

  abstract      = {The galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) at high-z provides key information on star-formation history and mass assembly in the young Universe. We aimed to use the unique combination of deep optical/NIR/MIR imaging provided by HST, Spitzer and the VLT in the CANDELS-UDS, GOODS-South, and HUDF fields to determine the GSMF over the redshift range 3.5$\lt$z$\lt$7.5. We utilised the HST WFC3/IR NIR imaging from CANDELS and HUDF09, reaching H\~{}27-28.5 over a total area of 369 arcmin2, in combination with associated deep HST ACS optical data, deep Spitzer IRAC imaging from the SEDS programme, and deep Y and K-band VLT Hawk-I images from the HUGS programme, to select a galaxy sample with high-quality photometric redshifts. These have been calibrated with more than 150 spectroscopic redshifts in the range 3.5$\lt$z$\lt$7.5, resulting in an overall precision of sigma\_z/(1+z)\~{}0.037. We have determined the low-mass end of the high-z GSMF with unprecedented precision, reaching down to masses as low as M*\~{}10\^{}9 Msun at z=4 and \~{}6x10\^{}9 Msun at z=7. We find that the GSMF at 3.5$\lt$z$\lt$7.5 depends only slightly on the recipes adopted to measure the stellar masses, namely the photo-z, the SFHs, the nebular contribution or the presence of AGN on the parent sample. The low-mass end of the GSMF is steeper than has been found at lower redshifts, but appears to be unchanged over the redshift range probed here. Our results are very different from previous GSMF estimates based on converting UV galaxy luminosity functions into mass functions via tight M/L relations. Integrating our evolving GSMF over mass, we find that the growth of stellar mass density is barely consistent with the time-integral of the SFR density over cosmic time at z$\gt$4. These results confirm the unique synergy of the CANDELS+HUDF, HUGS, and SEDS surveys for the discovery and study of moderate/low-mass galaxies at high redshifts.},

This survey, named HUGS (Hawk-I UDS and GOODS Survey), provides deep, high-quality imaging in the K and Y bands over the CANDELS UDS and GOODS-South fields. We describe here the survey strategy, the data reduction process, and the data quality. HUGS delivers the deepest and highest quality K-band images ever collected over areas of cosmological interest, and ideally complements the CANDELS data set in terms of image quality and depth. The seeing is exceptional and homogeneous, confined to the range 0.38``-0.43''. In the deepest region of the GOODS-S field, (which includes most of the HUDF) the K-band exposure time exceeds 80 hours of integration, yielding a 1-sigma magnitude limit of \~{}28.0 mag/sqarcsec. In the UDS field the survey matches the shallower depth of the CANDELS images reaching a 1-sigma limit per sq.arcsec of \~{}27.3mag in the K band and \~{}28.3mag in the Y-band, We show that the HUGS observations are well matched to the depth of the CANDELS WFC3/IR data, since the majority of even the faintest galaxies detected in the CANDELS H-band images are also detected in HUGS. We present the K-band galaxy number counts produced by combining the HUGS data from the two fields. We show that the slope of the number counts depends sensitively on the assumed distribution of galaxy sizes, with potential impact on the estimated extra-galactic background light (abridged).},

These AGNs are selected from Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations in the HUDF and COSMOS, with the centimetric radio emission tracing both star formation and AGN, and the sub/millimeter emission by dust tracing nearly pure star formation. We require radio emission to be $\geqslant5\times$ more luminous than the level associated with the sub/millimeter star formation to ensure that the radio emission is AGN-dominated, thereby allowing localization of the AGN and star formation independently. In all three galaxies, the AGN are located within the compact regions of gas-rich, heavily obscured, intense nuclear star formation, with $R\_e = 0.4-1.1$ kpc and average star formation rates of $\simeq100-1200$ $M\_\odot$yr$^{-1}$. If the current episode of star formation continues at such a rate over the stellar mass doubling time of their hosts, $\simeq 0.2$ Gyr, the newly formed stellar mass will be of the order of $10^{11}$ $M\_\odot$ within the central kpc region, concurrently and cospatially with significant growth of the SMBH. This is consistent with a picture of in-situ galactic bulge and SMBH formation. This work demonstrates the unique complementarity of VLA and ALMA observations to unambiguously pinpoint the locations of AGN and star formation down to $\simeq30$ mas, corresponding to $\simeq 230$ pc at $z = 3$.},

Our investigation combines data from Chandra and Galaxy Zoo: Hubble (GZH) in the AEGIS, COSMOS, and GOODS-S surveys to create samples of face-on, disc galaxies at 0.2 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1.0. We use a novel method to robustly compare a sample of 120 AGN host galaxies, defined to have 10\^{}42 erg/s $\lt$ L\_X $\lt$ 10\^{}44 erg/s, with inactive control galaxies matched in stellar mass, rest-frame colour, size, Sersic index, and redshift. Using the GZH bar classifications of each sample, we demonstrate that AGN hosts show no statistically significant enhancement in bar fraction or average bar likelihood compared to closely-matched inactive galaxies. In detail, we find that the AGN bar fraction cannot be enhanced above the control bar fraction by more than a factor of two, at 99.7\% confidence. We similarly find no significant difference in the AGN fraction among barred and non-barred galaxies. Thus we find no compelling evidence that large-scale bars directly fuel AGN at 0.2$\lt$z$\lt$1.0. This result, coupled with previous results at z=0, implies that moderate-luminosity AGN have not been preferentially fed by large-scale bars since z=1. Furthermore, given the low bar fractions at z$\gt$1, our findings suggest that large-scale bars have likely never directly been a dominant fueling mechanism for supermassive black hole growth.},

We derive detailed distributions of structural parameters and FIR luminosities from carefully constructed control samples of galaxies, which we then compare to those of the AGNs. At z\~{}1, AGNs show slightly diskier light profiles than massive inactive (non-AGN) galaxies, as well as modestly higher levels of gross galaxy disturbance (as measured by visual signatures of interactions and clumpy structure). In contrast, at z\~{}2, AGNs show similar levels of galaxy disturbance as inactive galaxies, but display a red central light enhancement, which may arise due to a more pronounced bulge in AGN hosts or due to extinguished nuclear light. We undertake a number of tests of these alternatives, but our results do not strongly favour one interpretation over the other. The mean SFR and its distribution among AGNs and inactive galaxies are similar at z$\gt$1.5. At z$\lt$1, however, clear and significant enhancements are seen in the SFRs of AGNs with bulge-dominated light profiles.

  abstract      = {We perform a detailed study of the resolved properties of emission-line galaxies at kpc-scale to investigate how small-scale and global properties of galaxies are related. 119 galaxies with high-resolution Keck/DEIMOS spectra are selected to cover a wide range in morphologies over the redshift range 0.2$\lt$z$\lt$1.3. Using the HST/ACS and HST/WFC3 imaging data taken as a part of the CANDELS project, for each galaxy we perform SED fitting per resolution element, producing resolved rest-frame U-V color, stellar mass, star formation rate, age and extinction maps. We develop a technique to identify blue and red ``regions'' within individual galaxies, using their rest-frame color maps. As expected, for any given galaxy, the red regions are found to have higher stellar mass surface densities and older ages compared to the blue regions. Furthermore, we quantify the spatial distribution of red and blue regions with respect to both redshift and stellar mass, finding that the stronger concentration of red regions toward the centers of galaxies is not a significant function of either redshift or stellar mass. We find that the ``main sequence'' of star forming galaxies exists among both red and blue regions inside galaxies, with the median of blue regions forming a tighter relation with a slope of 1.1+/-0.1 and a scatter of \~{}0.2 dex compared to red regions with a slope of 1.3+/-0.1 and a scatter of \~{}0.6 dex. The blue regions show higher specific Star Formation Rates (sSFR) than their red counterparts with the sSFR decreasing since z\~{}1, driver primarily by the stellar mass surface densities rather than the SFRs at a giver resolution element.},

  abstract      = {We use CANDELS imaging, 3D-HST spectroscopy, and Chandra X-ray data to investigate if active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are preferentially fueled by violent disk instabilities funneling gas into galaxy centers at 1.3$\lt$z$\lt$2.4. We select galaxies undergoing gravitational instabilities using the number of clumps and degree of patchiness as proxies. The CANDELS visual classification system is used to identify 44 clumpy disk galaxies, along with mass-matched comparison samples of smooth and intermediate morphology galaxies. We note that, despite being being mass-matched and having similar star formation rates, the smoother galaxies tend to be smaller disks with more prominent bulges compared to the clumpy galaxies. The lack of smooth extended disks is probably a general feature of the z\~{}2 galaxy population, and means we cannot directly compare with the clumpy and smooth extended disks observed at lower redshift. We find that z\~{}2 clumpy galaxies have slightly enhanced AGN fractions selected by integrated line ratios (in the mass-excitation method), but the spatially resolved line ratios indicate this is likely due to extended phenomena rather than nuclear AGNs. Meanwhile the X-ray data show that clumpy, smooth, and intermediate galaxies have nearly indistinguishable AGN fractions derived from both individual detections and stacked non-detections. The data demonstrate that AGN fueling modes at z\~{}1.85 - whether violent disk instabilities or secular processes - are as efficient in smooth galaxies as they are in clumpy galaxies.},

This dataset is combined with ancillary optical and NIR fluxes to constrain the dust attenuation law in the rest-frame NUV region of star-forming galaxies within the redshift window 1.5$\lt$z$\lt$3. We focus on the NUV bump strength (B) and the total-to-selective extinction ratio (Rv), targeting a sample of 1,753 galaxies. By comparing the data with a set of population synthesis models coupled to a parametric dust attenuation law, we constrain Rv and B, as well as the colour excess, E(B-V). We find a correlation between Rv and B, that can be interpreted either as a result of the grain size distribution, or a variation of the dust geometry among galaxies. According to the former, small dust grains are associated with a stronger NUV bump. The latter would lead to a range of clumpiness in the distribution of dust within the interstellar medium of star-forming galaxies. The observed wide range of NUV bump strengths can lead to a systematic in the interpretation of the UV slope ($\beta$) typically used to characterize the dust content. In this study we quantify these variations, concluding that the effects are $\Delta\beta$\~{}0.4.},

  abstract      = {Accurate measurements of galaxy masses and sizes are key to tracing galaxy evolution over time. Cosmological zoom-in simulations provide an ideal test bed for assessing the recovery of galaxy properties from observations. Here, we utilize galaxies with $M\_*\sim10^{10}-10^{11.5}M\_{\odot}$ at z\~{}1.7-2 from the MassiveFIRE cosmological simulation suite, part of the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. Using mock multi-band images, we compare intrinsic galaxy masses and sizes to observational estimates. We find that observations accurately recover stellar masses, with a slight average underestimate of \~{}0.06 dex and a \~{}0.15 dex scatter. Recovered half-light radii agree well with intrinsic half-mass radii when averaged over all viewing angles, with a systematic offset of \~{}0.1 dex (with the half-light radii being larger) and a scatter of \~{}0.2 dex. When using color gradients to account for mass-to-light variations, recovered half-mass radii also exceed the intrinsic half-mass radii by \~{}0.1 dex. However, if not properly accounted for, aperture effects can bias size estimates by \~{}0.1 dex. No differences are found between the mass and size offsets for star-forming and quiescent galaxies. Variations in viewing angle are responsible for \~{}25\% of the scatter in the recovered masses and sizes. Our results thus suggest that the intrinsic scatter in the mass-size relation may have previously been overestimated by \~{}25\%. Moreover, orientation-driven scatter causes the number density of very massive galaxies to be overestimated by \~{}0.5 dex at $M\_*\sim10^{11.5}M\_{\odot}$.},

We use state of the art infrared color diagnostics, combining Spitzer and Herschel observations, to separate dust-obscured AGN from dusty star forming galaxies (SFGs) in the CANDELS and COSMOS surveys. We calculate 24 micron counts of SFGs, AGN/star forming ``Composites'', and AGN. AGN and Composites dominate the counts above 0.8 mJy at 24 micron, and Composites form at least 25\% of an IR sample even to faint detection limits. We develop methods to use the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on JWST to identify dust-obscured AGN and Composite galaxies from z\~{}1-2. With the sensitivity and spacing of MIRI filters, we will detect $\gt$4 times as many AGN hosts than with Spitzer/IRAC criteria. Any star formation rates based on the 7.7 micron PAH feature (likely to be applied to MIRI photometry) must be corrected for the contribution of the AGN, or the SFR will be overestimated by \~{}35\% for cases where the AGN provides half the IR luminosity and \~{}50\% when the AGN accounts for 90\% of the luminosity. Finally, we demonstrate that our MIRI color technique can select AGN with an Eddington ratio of $\lambda\_{\rm Edd}\sim0.01$ and will identify AGN hosts with a higher sSFR than X-ray techniques alone. JWST/MIRI will enable critical steps forward in identifying and understanding dust-obscured AGN and the link to their host galaxies.},

  abstract      = {As part of our long-term campaign to understand how cold streams feed massive galaxies at high redshift, we study the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) of a supersonic, cold, dense gas stream as it penetrates through a hot, dilute circumgalactic medium (CGM). A linear analysis (Paper I) showed that, for realistic conditions, KHI may produce nonlinear perturbations to the stream during infall. Therefore, we proceed here to study the nonlinear stage of KHI, still limited to a two-dimensional slab with no radiative cooling or gravity. Using analytic models and numerical simulations, we examine stream breakup, deceleration and heating via surface modes and body modes. The relevant parameters are the density contrast between stream and CGM ($\delta$), the Mach number of the stream velocity with respect to the CGM ($M\_{\rm b}$) and the stream radius relative to the halo virial radius ($R\_{\rm s}/R\_{\rm v}$). We find that sufficiently thin streams disintegrate prior to reaching the central galaxy. The condition for breakup ranges from $R\_{\rm s} \lt 0.03 R\_{\rm v}$ for $(M\_{\rm b} \sim 0.75, \delta \sim 10)$ to $R\_{\rm s} \lt 0.003 R\_{\rm v}$ for $(M\_{\rm b} \sim 2.25, \delta \sim 100)$. However, due to the large stream inertia, KHI has only a small effect on the stream inflow rate and a small contribution to heating and subsequent Lyman-$\alpha$ cooling emission.},

  abstract      = {In the local Universe, the existence of very young galaxies (VYGs), having formed at least half their stellar mass in the last 1 Gyr, is debated. We predict the present-day fraction of VYGs among central galaxies as a function of galaxy stellar mass. For this, we apply to high mass resolution Monte-Carlo halo merger trees (MCHMTs) three (one) analytical models of galaxy formation, where the ratio of stellar to halo mass (mass growth rate) is a function of halo mass and redshift. Galaxy merging is delayed until orbital decay by dynamical friction. With starbursts associated with halo mergers, our models predict typically one percent of VYGs up to galaxy masses of $10^{10}$ M$\_\odot$, falling rapidly at higher masses, and VYGs are usually associated with recent major mergers of their haloes. Without these starbursts, two of the models have VYG fractions reduced by 1 or 2 dex at low or intermediate stellar masses, and VYGs are rarely associated with major halo mergers. In comparison, the state-of-the-art semi-analytical model (SAM) of Henriques et al. produces only 0.01\% of VYGs at intermediate masses. Finally, the Menci et al. SAM run on MCMHTs with Warm Dark Matter cosmology generates 10 times more VYGs at masses below $10^8$ M$\_\odot$ than when run with Cold Dark Matter. The wide range in these VYG fractions illustrates the usefulness of VYGs to constrain both galaxy formation and cosmological models.},

We identify two primary causes of halo mass loss: relaxation after a major merger and tidal stripping by a massive neighbouring halo. Major mergers initially boost $M\_{\mathrm{vir}}$ and typically cause the final halo to become more prolate and less relaxed and to have higher spin and lower NFW concentration. As the halo relaxes, high energy material from the recent merger gradually escapes beyond the virial radius, temporarily resulting in a net negative accretion rate that reduces the halo mass by $5-15\\%$ on average. Halos that experience a major merger around $z = 0.4$ typically reach a minimum mass near $z = 0$. Tidal stripping mainly occurs in dense regions, and it causes halos to become less prolate and have lower spins and higher NFW concentrations. Tidally stripped halos often lose a large fraction of their peak mass ($\gt 20\\%$) and most never recover (or even reattain a positive accretion rate). Low mass halos can be strongly affected by both post-merger mass loss and tidal stripping, while high mass halos are predominantly influenced by post-merger mass loss and show few signs of significant tidal stripping.},

We estimate the galaxy environment using a Bayesian-motivated measure of the distance to the third nearest neighbor for galaxies to the stellar mass completeness of our survey, $\log(M/M\_\odot)\gt9 (9.5)$ at z=1.3 (2.0). This method, when applied to a mock catalog with the photometric-redshift precision ($\sigma\_z / (1+z) \lesssim 0.02$), recovers galaxies in low- and high-density environments accurately. We quantify the environmental quenching efficiency, and show that at z$\gt$ 0.5 it depends on galaxy stellar mass, demonstrating that the effects of quenching related to (stellar) mass and environment are not separable. In high-density environments, the mass and environmental quenching efficiencies are comparable for massive galaxies ($\log (M/M\_\odot)\gtrsim$ 10.5) at all redshifts. For lower mass galaxies ($\log (M/M)\_\odot) \lesssim$ 10), the environmental quenching efficiency is very low at $z\gtrsim$ 1.5, but increases rapidly with decreasing redshift. Environmental quenching can account for nearly all quiescent lower mass galaxies ($\log(M/M\_\odot) \sim$ 9-10), which appear primarily at $z\lesssim$ 1.0. The morphologies of lower mass quiescent galaxies are inconsistent with those expected of recently quenched star-forming galaxies. Some environmental process must transform the morphologies on similar timescales as the environmental quenching itself. The evolution of the environmental quenching favors models that combine gas starvation (as galaxies become satellites) with gas exhaustion through star-formation and outflows (``overconsumption''), and additional processes such as galaxy interactions, tidal stripping and disk fading to account for the morphological differences between the quiescent and star-forming galaxy populations.},

  abstract      = {We derive two-dimensional dust attenuation maps at $\sim1~\mathrm{kpc}$ resolution from the UV continuum for 10 galaxies on the $z\sim2$ Star-Forming Main Sequence (SFMS). Comparison with IR data shows that 9 out of 10 galaxies have no further obscuration in addition to the UV-based correction. The individual rest-frame $V$-band dust attenuation (A$\_{\rm V}$) radial profiles scatter around an average profile that gently decreases from $\sim1.8$ mag in the center down to $\sim0.6$ mag at $\sim3-4$ half-mass radii. We use these A$\_{\rm V}$ maps to correct UV- and H$\alpha$-based star-formation rates (SFRs), which agree with each other. At masses $\leq10^{11}~M\_{\odot}$, the specific SFR (sSFR) profiles are on average radially constant at a mass-doubling timescale of $\sim300~\mathrm{Myr}$, pointing at a synchronous growth of bulge and disk components in such galaxies. At masses $\geq10^{11}~M\_{\odot}$, the dust-corrected sSFR profiles are typically centrally-suppressed by a factor of $\sim10$ relative to the galaxy outskirts. With total central obscuration disfavored, this indicates that at least a fraction of massive $z\sim2$ SFMS galaxies have started inside-out their star-formation quenching that will move them to the quenched sequence; this also highlights the key role of progenitor bias effects in the observed evolution of the quenched population. Galaxies above and below the ridge of the SFMS relation have respectively centrally-enhanced and centrally-suppressed sSFRs relative to their outskirts, supporting a picture where bulges are built due to gas `compaction' that leads to a high central SFR as galaxies move towards the upper envelope of SFMS.},

We measure the stellar mass, star formation rate, and dust extinction for galaxy inner and outer regions via spatially-resolved spectral energy distribution fitting based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. By comparing specific star formation rates (sSFRs) between inner and outer parts of the galaxies we find that the majority of galaxies with the high central mass densities show evidence for a preferentially lower sSFR in their centers than in their outer regions, indicative of reduced sSFRs in their central regions. We also study galaxies at z \~{} 5 and 6 (here limited to high spatial resolution in the rest-frame ultraviolet only), finding that they show sSFRs which are generally independent of radial distance from the center of the galaxies.

  abstract      = {We identify a strong lensing galaxy in the cluster IRC 0218 (also known as XMM-LSS J02182$-$05102) that is spectroscopically confirmed to be at $z=1.62$, making it the highest-redshift strong lens galaxy known. The lens is one of the two brightest cluster galaxies and lenses a background source galaxy into an arc and a counterimage. With Hubble Space Telescope (HST) grism and Keck/LRIS spectroscopy, we measure the source redshift to be $z\_{\rm S}=2.26$. Using HST imaging in ACS/F475W, ACS/F814W, WFC3/F125W, and WFC3/F160W, we model the lens mass distribution with an elliptical power-law profile and account for the effects of the cluster halo and nearby galaxies. The Einstein radius is $\theta\_{\rm E}=0.38^{+0.02}\_{-0.01}$`` ($3.2\_{-0.1}^{+0.2}$ kpc) and the total enclosed mass is M$\_{\rm tot} (\lt \theta\_{\rm E})=1.8^{+0.2}\_{-0.1}\times10^{11}~{\rm M}\_{\odot}$. We estimate that the cluster environment contributes $\sim10$\% of this total mass. Assuming a Chabrier IMF, the dark matter fraction within $\theta\_{{\rm E}}$ is $f\_{\rm DM}^{{\rm Chab}} = 0.3\_{-0.3}^{+0.1}$, while a Salpeter IMF is marginally inconsistent with the enclosed mass ($f\_{\rm DM}^{{\rm Salp}} = -0.3\_{-0.5}^{+0.2}$). The total magnification of the source is $\mu\_{\rm tot}=2.1\_{-0.3}^{+0.4}$. The source has at least one bright compact region offset from the source center. Emission from Ly$\alpha$ and [O III] are likely to probe different regions in the source.},

The sample was selected to represent pure, actively star-forming systems, absent of active galactic nuclei. The large lensing magnifications result in high signal-to-noise spectra that can probe faint IR recombination lines, including Pa-alpha and Br-alpha at high redshifts. The sample was augmented by three lensed galaxies with similar suites of unpublished data and observations from the literature, resulting in the final sample of seven galaxies. We use the IR recombination lines in conjunction with H-alpha observations to probe the extinction, Av, of these systems, as well as testing star formation rate (SFR) indicators against the SFR measured by fitting spectral energy distributions to far-IR photometry. Our galaxies occupy a range of Av from \~{}0 to 5.9 mag, larger than previously known for a similar range of IR luminosities at these redshifts. Thus, estimates of SFR even at z \~{} 2 must take careful count of extinction in the most IR luminous galaxies. We also measure extinction by comparing SFR estimates from optical emission lines with those from far-IR measurements. The comparison of results from these two independent methods indicates a large variety of dust distribution scenarios at 1 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3. Without correcting for dust extinction, the H-alpha SFR indicator underestimates the SFR; the size of the necessary correction depends on the IR luminosity and dust distribution scenario. Individual SFR estimates based on the 6.2 micron PAH emission line luminosity do not show a systematic discrepancy with extinction, although a considerable, \~{}0.2 dex scatter is observed.},

We identify 17 members with L(IR)$\gt$10\^{}(11) Lsun, and these IR luminous members follow the same trend of increasing star formation with stellar mass that is observed in the field at z\~{}2. Using rates derived from both the 24 micron imaging and SED fitting, we find that the relative fraction of star-forming members triples from the lowest to highest galaxy density regions, e.g. the IR luminous fraction increases from \~{}8\% at Sigma\~{}10 gal per Mpc\^{}2 to \~{}25\% at Sigma$\gt$100 gal per Mpc\^{}2.

We identify 900 red galaxies with 0.15$\lt$z$\lt$0.3 from the AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey (AGES) selected from the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey Bootes field. Using Spitzer/MIPS, we classify 89 (\~{}10\%) with 24-micron infrared excess (f24$\gt$0.3 mJy). We determine the prevalence of AGN and star-formation activity in all the AGES galaxies using optical line diagnostics and mid-IR color-color criteria. Using the IRAC color-color diagram from the IRAC Shallow Survey, we find that 64\% of the 24-micron excess red galaxies are likely to have strong PAH emission features in the 8-micron IRAC band. This fraction is significantly larger than the 5\% of red galaxies with f24$\lt$0.3 mJy that are estimated to have strong PAH emission, suggesting that the infrared emission is largely due to star-formation processes. Only 15\% of the 24-micron excess red galaxies have optical line diagnostics characteristic of star-formation (64\% are classified as AGN and 21\% are unclassifiable). The difference between the optical and infrared results suggest that both AGN and star-formation activity is occurring simultaneously in many of the 24-micron excess red galaxies. These results should serve as a warning to studies that exclusively use optical line diagnostics to determine the dominant emission mechanism in the infrared and other bands. We find that \~{}40\% of the 24-micron excess red galaxies are edge-on spiral galaxies with high optical extinctions. The remaining sources are likely to be red galaxies whose 24-micron emission comes from a combination of obscured AGN and star-formation activity.},

  abstract      = {A randomly chosen star in today's Universe is most likely to live in a galaxy with a stellar mass between that of the Milky Way and Andromeda. Yet it remains uncertain how the structural evolution of these bulge-disk systems proceeded. Most of the unobscured star formation we observe building Andromdeda progenitors at 0.7$\lt$z$\lt$1.5 occurs in disks, but $\gt$90\% of their star formation is reprocessed by dust and remains unaccounted for. Here we map 500micron dust continuum emission in an Andromeda progenitor at z=1.25 to probe where it is growing through dust-obscured star formation. Combining resolved dust measurements from the NOEMA interferometer with Hubble Space Telescope Halpha maps and multicolor imaging (including new UV data from the HDUV survey), we find a bulge growing by dust-obscured star formation: while the unobscured star formation is centrally suppressed, the dust continuum is centrally concentrated, filling in the ring-like structures evident in the Halpha and UV emission. Reflecting this, the dust emission is more compact than the optical/UV tracers of star formation with r\_e(dust)=3.4kpc, r\_e(Halpha)/r\_e(dust)=1.4, and r\_e(UV)/r\_e(dust)=1.8. Crucially, however, the bulge and disk of this galaxy are building simultaneously; although the dust emission is more compact than the rest-optical emission (r\_e(optical)/r\_e(dust)=1.4), it is somewhat less compact than the stellar mass (r\_e(M\_*)/r\_e(dust)=0.9). Taking the 500micron emission as a tracer of star formation, the expected structural evolution of this galaxy can be accounted for by star formation: it will grow in size by Delta(r\_e)/Delta(M\_*)\~{}0.3 and central surface density by Delta(Sigma\_cen)/Delta(M\_*)\~{}0.9. Finally, our observations are consistent with a picture in which merging and disk instabilities drive gas to the center of galaxies, boosting global star formation rates above the main sequence and building bulges.},

The sample comprises 407 BGGs selected from X-ray galaxy groups ($M\_{200}=10^{12.8}-10^{14} \;M\_{\odot}$) out to $z\sim1.3$ identified in the COSMOS, XMM-LSS, and AEGIS fields. We find that BGGs constitute two distinct populations of quiescent and star-forming galaxies and their mean SFR is $\sim2$ dex higher than the median SFR at $ z\lt1.3 $. Both the mean and the median SFRs decline with time by $\gt2$ dex. The mean (median) of stellar mass of BGGs has grown by $0.3$ dex since $z=1.3$ to the present day. We show that up to $\sim45\\% $ of the stellar mass growth in a star-forming BGG can be due to its star-formation activity. With respect to $f^{BGG}\_{b,200}$, we find it to increase with decreasing redshift by $\sim0.35$ dex while decreasing with halo mass in a redshift dependent manner. We show that the slope of the relation between $f^{BGG}\_{b,200}$ and halo mass increases negatively with decreasing redshift. This trend is driven by an insufficient star-formation in BGGs, compared to the halo growth rate. We separately show the BGGs with the 20$\backslash$\% highest $f^{BGG}\_{b,200}$ are generally non-star-forming galaxies and grow in mass by processes not related to star formation (e.g., dry mergers and tidal striping). We present the $ M\_\star-M\_h $ and $ M\_\star/M\_h-M\_h $ relations and compare them with semi-analytic model predictions and a number of results from the literature. We quantify the intrinsic scatter in stellar mass of BGGs at fixed halo mass ($\sigma\_{log M\_{\star}}$) and find that $\sigma\_{log M\_{\star}}$ increases from 0.3 dex at $ z\sim0.2 $ to 0.5 dex at $ z\sim1.0 $ due to the bimodal distribution of stellar mass.},

The KMOS 3D survey utilizes synergies with multi-wavelength ground- and space-based surveys to trace the evolution of spatially resolved kinematics and star formation from a homogeneous sample over 5 Gyr of cosmic history. Targets, drawn from a mass-selected parent sample from the 3D-HST survey, cover the star formation-stellar mass ( M * ) and rest-frame ( U – V ) – M * planes uniformly. We describe the selection of targets, the observations, and the data reduction. In the first-year of data we detect Hα emission in 191 M * = 3 × 10 9 -7 × 10 11 M ☉ galaxies at z = 0.7-1.1 and z = 1.9-2.7. In the current sample 83% of the resolved galaxies are rotation dominated, determined from a continuous velocity gradient and v rot /σ 0 > 1, implying that the star-forming "main sequence" is primarily composed of rotating galaxies at both redshift regimes. When considering additional stricter criteria, the Hα kinematic maps indicate that at least ~70% of the resolved galaxies are disk-like systems. Our high-quality KMOS data confirm the elevated velocity dispersions reported in previous integral field spectroscopy studies at z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 0.7. For rotation-dominated disks, the average intrinsic velocity dispersion decreases by a factor of two from 50 km s –1 at z ~ 2.3 to 25 km s –1 at z ~ 0.9. Combined with existing results spanning z ~ 0-3, we show that disk velocity dispersions follow an evolution that is consistent with the dependence of velocity dispersion on gas fractions predicted by marginally stable disk theory.},

  abstract = {Using stellar kinematics measurements, we investigate the growth of massive, quiescent galaxies from z ~ 2 to today. We present X-Shooter spectra from the UV to NIR and dynamical mass measurements of five quiescent massive (>10 11 M ☉ ) galaxies at z ~ 2. This triples the sample of z > 1.5 galaxies with well-constrained (δσ < 100 km s –1 ) velocity dispersion measurements. From spectral population synthesis modeling we find that these galaxies have stellar ages that range from 0.5 to 2 Gyr, with no signs of ongoing star formation. We measure velocity dispersions (290-450 km s –1 ) from stellar absorption lines and find that they are 1.6-2.1 times higher than those of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at the same mass. Sizes are measured using GALFIT from Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 H 160 and UDS K -band images. The dynamical masses correspond well to the spectral energy distribution based stellar masses, with dynamical masses that are ~15% higher. We find that M * / M dyn may decrease slightly with time, which could reflect the increase of the dark matter fraction within an increasing effective radius. We combine different stellar kinematic studies from the literature and examine the structural evolution from z ~ 2 to z ~ 0: we confirm that at fixed dynamical mass, the effective radius increases by a factor of ~2.8, and the velocity dispersion decreases by a factor of ~1.7. The mass density within one effective radius decreases by a factor of ~20, while within a fixed physical radius (1 kpc) it decreases only mildly (factor of ~2). When we allow for an evolving mass limit by selecting a population of galaxies at fixed number density, a stronger size growth with time is found (factor of ~4), velocity dispersion decreases by a factor of ~1.4, and interestingly, the mass density within 1 kpc is consistent with no evolution. This finding suggests that massive quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2 grow inside out, consistent with the expectations from minor mergers.},

  abstract      = {At redshift z{\thinsp}={\thinsp}2, when the Universe was just three billion years old, half of the most massive galaxies were extremely compact and had already exhausted their fuel for star formation. It is believed that they were formed in intense nuclear starbursts and that they ultimately grew into the most massive local elliptical galaxies seen today, through mergers with minor companions, but validating this picture requires higher-resolution observations of their centres than is currently possible. Magnification from gravitational lensing offers an opportunity to resolve the inner regions of galaxies. Here we report an analysis of the stellar populations and kinematics of a lensed z{\thinsp}={\thinsp}2.1478 compact galaxy, which{\mdash}surprisingly{\mdash}turns out to be a fast-spinning, rotationally supported disk galaxy. Its stars must have formed in a disk, rather than in a merger-driven nuclear starburst. The galaxy was probably fed by streams of cold gas, which were able to penetrate the hot halo gas until they were cut off by shock heating from the dark matter halo. This result confirms previous indirect indications that the first galaxies to cease star formation must have gone through major changes not just in their structure, but also in their kinematics, to evolve into present-day elliptical galaxies.},

We have identified 5859, 3001, 857, 481, 217, and 6 galaxy candidates at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/803/1/34/apj508910ieqn3.gif] {$z\sim 4$} , ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/803/1/34/apj508910ieqn4.gif] {$z\sim 5$} , ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/803/1/34/apj508910ieqn5.gif] {$z\sim 6$} , ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/803/1/34/apj508910ieqn6.gif] {$z\sim 7$} , ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/803/1/34/apj508910ieqn7.gif] {$z\sim 8$} , and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/803/1/34/apj508910ieqn8.gif] {$z\sim 10$} , respectively, from the ∼1000 arcmin 2 area covered by these data sets. This sample of >10,000 galaxy candidates at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/803/1/34/apj508910ieqn9.gif] {$z\geqslant 4$} is by far the largest assembled to date with HST . The selection of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/803/1/34/apj508910ieqn10.gif] {$z\,\sim $} 4–8 candidates over the five CANDELS fields allows us to assess the cosmic variance; the largest variations are at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/803/1/34/apj508910ieqn11.gif] {$z\geqslant 7$} . Our new LF determinations at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/803/1/34/apj508910ieqn12.gif] {$z\sim 4$} and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/803/1/34/apj508910ieqn13.gif] {$z\sim 5$} span a 6 mag baseline and reach to –16 AB mag. These determinations agree well with previous estimates, but the larger samples and volumes probed here result in a more reliable sampling of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/803/1/34/apj508910ieqn14.gif] {$\gt {{L}^{*}}$} galaxies and allow us to reassess the form of the UV LFs. Our new LF results strengthen our earlier findings to ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/803/1/34/apj508910ieqn15.gif] {$3.4\sigma $} significance for a steeper faint-end slope of the UV LF at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/803/1/34/apj508910ieqn16.gif] {$z\gt 4$} , with α evolving from ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/803/1/34/apj508910ieqn17.gif] {$\alpha =-1.64\pm 0.04$} at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/803/1/34/apj508910ieqn18.gif] {$z\sim 4$} to ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/803/1/34/apj508910ieqn19.gif] {$\alpha =-2.06\pm 0.13$} at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/803/1/34/apj508910ieqn20.gif] {$z\sim 7$} (and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/803/1/34/apj508910ieqn21.gif] {$\alpha =-2.02\pm 0.23$} at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/803/1/34/apj508910ieqn22.gif] {$z\sim 8$} ), consistent with that expected from the evolution of the halo mass function. We find less evolution in the characteristic magnitude M * from ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/803/1/34/apj508910ieqn23.gif] {$z\sim 7$} to ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/803/1/34/apj508910ieqn24.gif] {$z\sim 4;$} the observed evolution in the LF is now largely represented by changes in ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/803/1/34/apj508910ieqn25.gif] {${{\phi }^{*}}$} . No evidence for a non-Schechter-like form to the z ∼ 4–8 LFs is found. A simple conditional LF model based on halo growth and evolution in the M/L ratio ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/803/1/34/apj508910ieqn26.gif] {$(\propto {{(1+z)}^{-1.5}})$} of halos provides a good representation of the observed evolution.},

  abstract      = {The stellar initial mass function (IMF) describes the mass distribution of stars at the time of their formation and is of fundamental importance for many areas of astrophysics. The IMF is reasonably well constrained in the disk of the Milky Way but we have very little direct information on the form of the IMF in other galaxies and at earlier cosmic epochs. Here we report observations of the NaI doublet and the Wing-Ford molecular FeH band in the spectra of elliptical galaxies. These lines are strong in stars with masses less than 0.3M$_{solar}$ (where M$_{solar}$ is the mass of the Sun) and are weak or absent in all other types of stars. We unambiguously detect both signatures, consistent with previous studies that were based on data of lower signal-to-noise ratio. The direct detection of the light of low-mass stars implies that they are very abundant in elliptical galaxies, making up over 80\% of the total number of stars and contributing more than 60\% of the total stellar mass. We infer that the IMF in massive star-forming galaxies in the early Universe produced many more low-mass stars than the IMF in the Milky Way disk, and was probably slightly steeper than the Salpeter form in the mass range 0.1M$_{solar}$ to 1M$_{solar}$.},

  abstract      = {We present 3D-HST, a near-infrared spectroscopic Treasury program with the Hubble Space Telescope for studying the physical processes that shape galaxies in the distant universe. 3D-HST provides rest-frame optical spectra for a sample of ~7000 galaxies at 1 < z < 3.5, the epoch when ~60% of all star formation took place, the number density of quasars peaked, the first galaxies stopped forming stars, and the structural regularity that we see in galaxies today must have emerged. 3D-HST will cover three quarters (625 arcmin 2 ) of the CANDELS Treasury survey area with two orbits of primary WFC3/G141 grism coverage and two to four orbits with the ACS/G800L grism in parallel. In the IR, these exposure times yield a continuum signal-to-noise ratio of ~5 per resolution element at H 140 ~ 23.1 and a 5σ emission-line sensitivity of ~5 × 10 –17 erg s –1 cm –2 for typical objects, improving by a factor of ~2 for compact sources in images with low sky background levels. The WFC3/G141 spectra provide continuous wavelength coverage from 1.1 to 1.6 μm at a spatial resolution of ~0 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/farcs.gif] {farcs} 13, which, combined with their depth, makes them a unique resource for studying galaxy evolution. We present an overview of the preliminary reduction and analysis of the grism observations, including emission-line and redshift measurements from combined fits to the extracted grism spectra and photometry from ancillary multi-wavelength catalogs. The present analysis yields redshift estimates with a precision of σ( z ) = 0.0034(1 + z ), or σ( v ) ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 1000 km s –1 . We illustrate how the generalized nature of the survey yields near-infrared spectra of remarkable quality for many different types of objects, including a quasar at z = 4.7, quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2, and the most distant T-type brown dwarf star known. The combination of the CANDELS and 3D-HST surveys will provide the definitive imaging and spectroscopic data set for studies of the 1 < z < 3.5 universe until the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope .},
