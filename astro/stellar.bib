  abstract    = {Investigating the chemical homogeneity of stars born from the same molecular cloud at virtually the same time is very important for our understanding of the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium and with it the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. One major cause of inhomogeneities in the abundances of open clusters is stellar evolution of the cluster members. In this work, we investigate variations in the surface chemical composition of member stars of the old open cluster M67 as a possible consequence of atomic diffusion effects taking place during the main-sequence phase. The abundances used are obtained from high-resolution UVES/FLAMES spectra within the framework of the Gaia-ESO Survey. We find that the surface abundances of stars on the main sequence decrease with increasing mass reaching a minimum at the turn-off. After deepening of the convective envelope in sub-giant branch stars, the initial surface abundances are restored. We found the measured abundances to be consistent with the predictions of stellar evolutionary models for a cluster with the age and metallicity of M67. Our findings indicate that atomic diffusion poses a non-negligible constraint on the achievable precision of chemical tagging methods.},

  title       = {The GALAH Survey: Accurate Radial Velocities and Library of Observed Stellar Template Spectra},
  abstract    = {GALAH is a large-scale magnitude-limited southern stellar spectroscopic survey. Buder et al. provide values of stellar parameters and abundances of 23 elements for 342,682 stars. Here we add a description of the public release of radial velocities with a typical accuracy of 0.1 km/s for 199,628 of these stars. This accuracy is achievable due to the large wavelength coverage, high resolving power and good signal to noise ratio of the observed spectra, but also because effects that are often neglected, such as 3-dimensional convective motions in stellar atmosphere, and gravitational redshift along the light-path from the star to the observer are taken into account. We do not compare observed and synthetic spectra directly, but we add an intermediate step in which medians of observed spectra with virtually identical values of stellar parameters are derived. These observed medians are nearly noiseless, as they are obtained from between 103 and 2276 observed spectra belonging to the same bin of stellar parameter values with a width of 50 K in temperature, 0.2 dex in gravity, and 0.1 dex in metallicity. Hence we are publicly releasing also a library of 1277 median spectra, which trace the well-populated regions of the HR diagram for stars with metallicity between -0.6 and +0.3. Our results are used to check the radial velocities of six observed open clusters. The GALAH radial velocities are complementary to Gaia DR2, in terms of magnitude coverage, sample size and accuracy. They are an excellent match to the accuracy of velocity components along the sky plane derived by Gaia for the same stars. They can be used to study dynamics within stellar clusters, associations and streams in the Galaxy. This may have important applications for studies of the distribution of dark matter. The library of medians of observed spectra will be useful as a reference set in the visible range.},

  abstract    = {The existence of multiple layers in the inner Orion Nebula has been revealed using data from an Atlas of spectra at 2" and 12 km/s resolution. These data were sometimes grouped over Samples of 10"x10"to produce high Signal to Noise spectra and sometimes grouped into sequences of pseudo-slit Spectra of 12.8"--39" width for high spatial resolution studies. Multiple velocity systems were found: Vmif traces the Main Ionization Front (MIF), Vscat arises from back-scattering of Vmif emission by particles in the background Photon Dissociation Region (PDR), Vlow is an ionized layer in front of the MIF and if it is the source of the stellar absorption lines seen in the Trapezium stars, it must lie between the foreground Veil and those stars, Vnew may represent ionized gas evaporating from the Veil away from the observer. There are features such as the Bright Bar where variations of velocities are due to changing tilts of the MIF, but velocity changes above about 25"arise from variations in velocity of the background PDR. In a region 25" ENE of the Orion-S Cloud one finds dramatic changes in the [OIII]components, including the signals from the Vlowoiii and Vmifoiii becoming equal, indicating shadowing of gas from stellar photons of >24.6 eV. This feature is also seen in areas to the west and south of the Orion-S Cloud.},

  abstract      = {We cross-match objects from several different astronomical catalogs to determine the absolute proper proper motions of stars within the 30-arcmin radius fields of 115 Milky-Way globular clusters with the accuracy of 1--2\~{}mas/yr. The proper motions are based on positional data recovered from the USNO-B1, 2MASS, URAT1, ALLWISE, UCAC5, and GAIA DR1 surveys with up to 10 positions spanning an epoch difference of up to $\sim$\~{}65\~{}years, and reduced to GAIA DR1 TGAS frame using UCAC5 as the reference catalog. Cluster members are photometrically identified by selecting horizontal- and red-giant branch stars on color-magnitude diagrams, and the mean absolute proper motions of the clusters with a typical formal error of $\sim$\~{}0.4\~{}mas/yr are computed by averaging the proper motions of selected members. The inferred absolute proper motions of clusters are combined with available radial-velocity data and heliocentric distance estimates to compute the cluster orbits in terms of the Galactic potential models based on Miyamoto and Nagai disk, Hernquist spheroid, and modified isothermal dark-matter halo (axisymmetric model without a bar) and the same model + rotating Ferre's bar (non-axisymmetric). Five distant clusters have higher-than-escape velocities, most likely due to large errors of computed transversal velocities, whereas the computed orbits of all other clusters remain bound to the Galaxy. Unlike previously published results, we find the bar to affect substantially the orbits of most of the clusters, even those at large Galactocentric distances, bringing appreciable chaotization, especially in the portions of the orbits close to the Galactic center, and stretching out the orbits of some of the thick-disk clusters.},

However, with the advent of large kinematic surveys, and especially of the upcoming Gaia data releases there is a need for more sophisticated and automated substructure finders. We analyze the TGASxRAVE dataset to identify moving groups in the Galactic disk. These groups of stars may then be used to map dynamical and star formation processes in the vicinity of the Sun. We use the ROCKSTAR algorithm, a "friends-of-friends"-like substructure finder in 6D phase-space, and analyze the Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams of the groups identified. We find 125 moving groups within 300 pc of the Sun, containing on average 50 stars, and with 3D velocity dispersions smaller than 10 km/s. Most of these groups were previously unknown. Our photometric analysis allows us to isolate a subsample of 30 statistically significant groups likely composed of stars that were born together.},

  abstract      = {Gravitational 3-body interaction among binary stars and the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of the Milky Way occasionally ejects a hypervelocity star (HVS) with a velocity of \~{}1000 km/s. Due to the ejection location, such a HVS initially has negligible azimuthal angular momentum Lz \~{} 0 kpc km/s. Even if the halo is mildly triaxial, Lz of a recently ejected nearby HVS remains negligible, since its flight time from the Galactic center is too short to accumulate noticeable torque. However, if we make a wrong assumption about the Solar position and velocity, such a HVS would apparently have noticeable non-zero angular momentum, due to the wrong reflex motion of the Sun. Conversely, with precise astrometric data for a nearby HVS, we can measure the Solar position and velocity by requiring that the HVS has zero angular momentum. Based on this idea, here we propose a method to estimate the Galactocentric distance of the Sun R0 and the Galactocentric Solar azimuthal velocity Vsun by using a HVS. We demonstrate with mock data for nearby HVS candidate (LAMOST-HVS1) that the Gaia astrometric data, along with the currently available constraint on Vsun/R0 from the proper motion measurement of Sgr A*, can constrain R0 and Vsun with uncertainties of \~{} 0.27 kpc and \~{}7.8 km/s (or fractional uncertainties of 3 percent), respectively. Our method will be a promising tool to constrain (R0, Vsun), given that Gaia is expected to discover many nearby HVSs in the near future.},

  abstract      = {The evolution of self-gravitating clouds of isothermal gas forms the basis of many star formation theories. Therefore it is important to know under what conditions such a cloud will undergo homologous collapse into a single, massive object, or will fragment into a spectrum of smaller ones. And if it fragments, do initial conditions (e.g. Jeans mass, sonic mass) influence the mass function of the fragments, as predicted by many theories of star formation? In this paper we show that the relevant parameter separating homologous collapse from fragmentation is not the Mach number of the initial turbulence (as suspected by many), but the infall Mach number $\mathcal{M}\_{\rm infall}\sim\sqrt{G M/(R c\_s^2)}$, equivalent to the number of Jeans masses in the initial cloud $N\_J$. We also show that fragmenting clouds produce a power-law mass function with slopes close to the expected -2 (i.e. equal mass in all logarithmic mass intervals). However, the low-mass cut-off of this mass function is entirely numerical; the initial properties of the cloud have no effect on it. In other words, if $\mathcal{M}\_{\rm infall}\gg 1$, fragmentation proceeds without limit to masses much smaller than the initial Jeans mass.},

  abstract      = {Spectrophotometric distances to stars observed by contemporary spectroscopic surveys offer an important alternative to parallax distances, specially after the future Gaia data releases. Here we present a probabilistic approach to modeling spectroscopic information for a subset of 4,000 main sequence stars with good parallaxes ($\sigma\_\varpi/\varpi\lt0.1$) from the LAMOST $\times$ TGAS $\times$ 2MASS cross-match, yielding a precise spectroscopic distance estimator with uncertainties of $\sim$6\% for single stars. Unlike previous approaches to this problem, we explicitly account for the individual parallax uncertainties in the model building and fully incorporate the common binarity of main sequence stars, which would lead to biased distance estimates if neglected. Using this model, we estimate the distance for all (150,000) main sequence stars from LAMOST Data Release 5, without parallax information. As an application, we compute their orbital actions, where distance errors dominate. These new distances yield typically a factor 5 of improvement when estimating orbital actions, which illustrates how future studies of the Milky Way's orbital structure can benefit from using our model. For the fainter and more distant stars of most current spectroscopic surveys, an approach such as the one presented in this work will deliver better distances than Gaia Data Release 2.},

  abstract      = {A deep understanding of the Milky Way galaxy, its formation and evolution requires observations of large numbers of stars. Stellar photometry provides an economical method to obtain intrinsic stellar parameters. With the addition of distance information -- a prospect made real for more than a billion stars with the second Gaia data release -- deriving reliable ages from photometry is a possibility. We developed a Bayesian method to generate 2D probability maps of a star's age and metallicity from photometry and parallax using isochrones. Our synthetic tests show that colours in the optical or near-infrared cannot by themselves provide unique ages and metallicities due to strong degeneracy between the two parameters. Including a near-UV passband enables us to break this degeneracy for many types of stars. It is possible to find well-constrained ages and metallicities for turn-off and sub-giant stars with colours including a U band and a parallax with an uncertainty less than approximately 20\%. Metallicities alone are possible for the main sequence and giant branch. We attempted to recover ages and metallicities from real data, using the Gaia benchmark stars and the old open cluster NGC 188. This revealed significant limitations in the stellar isochrones. The ages of the cluster stars varied with evolutionary stage, such that turn-off ages were discrepant with those on the sub-giant branch and metallicities varied significantly throughout the HR diagram. Most importantly, the parameters varied appreciably depending on which colour combinations were used in the derivation. We conclude that there exists a noticeable mismatch between the photometry from isochrones and those from observations. Our results here are a warning to those applying isochrone ages indiscriminately. Further efforts to improve the models will result in significant advances in our ability to study the Galaxy.},

  title       = {Massive runaways and walkaway stars},
  abstract    = {Anticipating the kinematic constraints from the Gaia mission, we perform an extensive numerical study of the evolution of massive binary systems to predict the peculiar velocities that stars obtain when their companion collapses and disrupts the system. Our aim is to (1) identify which predictions are robust against model uncertainties and assess their implications, (2) investigate which physical processes leave a clear imprint and may therefore be constrained observationally and (3) provide a suite of publicly available model predictions. We find that $22_{-8}^{+26}$% of all massive binary systems merge prior to the first core collapse in the system. Of the remainder, $86_{-9}^{+11}$% become unbound because of the core-collapse. Remarkably, this rarely produce runaway stars (i.e., stars with velocities above 30 km/s). These are outnumbered by more than an order of magnitude by slower unbound companions, or "walkaway stars". This is a robust outcome of our simulations and is due to the reversal of the mass ratio prior to the explosion and widening of the orbit, as we show analytically and numerically. We estimate a $10^{+5}_{-8}$% of massive stars to be walkaways and only $0.5^{+1.0}_{-0.4}$% to be runaways, nearly all of which have accreted mass from their companion. Our findings are consistent with earlier studies, however the low runaway fraction we find is in tension with observed fractions 10%. If Gaia confirms these high fractions of massive runaway stars resulting from binaries, it would imply that we are currently missing physics in the binary models. Finally, we show that high end of the mass distributions of runaway stars is very sensitive to the assumed black hole natal kicks and propose this as a potentially stringent test for the explosion mechanism. We discuss companions remaining bound which can evolve into X-ray and gravitational wave sources.},

We demonstrate that a relatively short epoch difference of 3 years is sufficient to reach a $\sim$0.1 mas yr$^{-1}$ level of precision or better. A number of stars have relative proper motions exceeding a 3-sigma error threshold, representing a mixture of Milky Way denizens and 17 potential LMC runaway stars. Based upon 183 VFTS OB-stars with the best proper motions, we conclude that none of them move faster than $\sim$0.3 mas yr$^{-1}$ in each coordinate -- equivalent to $\sim$70 km s$^{-1}$. Among the remaining 351 VFTS stars with less accurate proper motions, only one candidate OB runaway can be identified. We rule out any OB star in our sample moving at a tangential velocity exceeding $\sim$120 km s$^{-1}$. The most significant result of this study is finding 10 stars over wide range of masses, which appear to be ejected from the massive star cluster R136 in the tangential plane to angular distances from $35^{\prime\prime}$ out to $407^{\prime\prime}$, equivalent to 8-98 pc. The tangential velocities of these runaways appear to be correlated with apparent magnitude, indicating a possible dependence on the stellar mass.},

  abstract    = {Many field stars reside in binaries, and the analysis and interpretation of photometric and spectroscopic surveys must take this into account. We have developed a model to predict how binaries influence the scientific results inferred from large spectroscopic surveys. Based on the rapid binary evolution code BSE, it allows us to model a representative population of binaries and generate synthetic survey observations. We describe this model in detail, and apply it to the radial velocity variation of subgiant and giant stars in the Galactic disc, as observed by the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. APOGEE provides an excellent data set for testing our binary models since a large fraction of the stars have been observed multiple times. By comparing our model to the APOGEE observations we constrain the initial binary fraction of solar-metallicity stars in the sample to be $f_{\rm b,0}=0.35\pm0.01$, in line with the solar neighbourhood. We find that the binary fraction is higher at lower metallicities, consistent with other observational studies. Our model matches the shape of the high-velocity scatter in APOGEE, which suggests that most velocity variability above 0.5 km/s comes from binaries. Our exploration of binary initial properties shows that APOGEE is mostly sensitive to binaries with periods between 3 and 3000 years, and is largely insensitive to the detailed properties of the population.

  title       = {Revisiting hypervelocity stars after Gaia DR2},
  abstract    = {Hypervelocity stars are intriguing rare objects traveling at speeds large enough to be unbound from the Milky Way. Several mechanisms have been proposed for producing them, including the interaction of the Galaxy's super-massive black hole (SMBH) with a binary; rapid mass-loss from a companion to a star in a short-period binary; the tidal disruption of an infalling galaxy and finally ejection from the Large Magellanic Cloud. While previously discovered high-velocity early-type stars are thought to be the result of an interaction with the SMBH, the origin of high-velocity late type stars is ambiguous. The second data release of Gaia (DR2) enables a unique opportunity to resolve this ambiguity and determine whether any late-type candidates are truly unbound from the Milky Way. In this paper, we utilize the new proper motion and velocity information available from DR2 to re-evaluate a collection of historical data compiled on the newly-created Open Fast Stars Catalog. We find that almost all previously-known high-velocity late-type stars are most likely bound to the Milky Way. Only one late-type object (LAMOST J115209.12+120258.0) is unbound from the Galaxy. Performing integrations of orbital histories, we find that this object cannot have been ejected from the Galactic centre and thus may be either debris from the disruption of a satellite galaxy or a disc runaway.},

In the $R-V_{\rm rot}$ map, we have identified many resonance-like features, which are compared with the location of the spiral arms and the expected outer Lindblad resonance of the Galactic bar.

We investigate the possibility that nuclear star clusters of dwarf galaxies may be the progenitors of the massive globular clusters of a central galaxy by examining the galactic nuclei formed in cosmological galaxy formation simulations. We derive structural properties of these nuclear regions, including mass, size, rotation, and shape. By using theoretical supernova yields to model the supernova enrichment in the simulations, we obtain individual elemental abundances for Fe, O, Na, Mg, and Al. Our nuclei are systematically more metal-rich than their host galaxies, which lie on the expected mass-metallicity relation. Some nuclei have a spread in Fe comparable to the anomalous globular clusters of the Milky Way, such as $\omega$ Cen and M54, lending support to the hypothesis that nuclear star clusters of dwarf galaxies could be the progenitors of these objects. None of our nuclear regions contain the light element abundance spreads that characterize globular clusters, even when a large age spread is present. Our results demonstrate that extended star formation history within clusters, with metal pollution provided solely by supernova ejecta, is not able to produce the multiple populations present in globular clusters.},

Our solution reproduces the results of state-of-the-art hydro simulations across the adiabatic and radiative stages for the gas-only case and predicts that typical CR acceleration efficiencies ($\approx 10\%$ ) can boost SNR momentum deposition by a factor of 3--5. This enhancement becomes more prominent in environments in which the gas experiences more severe radiative losses.

  abstract    = {We present a new millimeter CO-line observation towards supernova remnant (SNR) CTB 87, which was regarded purely as a pulsar wind nebula (PWN), and an optical investigation of a coincident surrounding superbubble. The CO observation shows that the SNR delineated by the radio emission is projectively covered by a molecular cloud (MC) complex at V$_{\rm {LSR}}$ = $-60$-$-54$ km s$^{-1}$. Both the symmetric axis of the radio emission and the trailing X-ray PWN appear projectively to be along a gap between two molecular gas patches at $-58$-$-57$ km s$^{-1}$. Asymmetric broad profiles of $^{12}$CO lines peaked at $-58$ km s$^{-1}$ are found at the eastern and southwestern edges of the radio emission. This represents a kinematic signature consistent with an SNR-MC interaction. We also find that a superbubble, $\sim 37'$ in radius, appears to surround the SNR from HI 21cm (V$_{\rm {LSR}} \sim -61$-$-68$ km s$^{-1}$), WISE mid-IR, and optical extinction data. We build a multi-band photometric stellar sample of stars within the superbubble region and find 82 OB star candidates. The likely peak distance in the stars' distribution seems consistent with the distance previously suggested for CTB 87. We suggest the arc-like radio emission is mainly the relic of the part of blastwave that propagates into the MC complex and is now in a radiative stage while the other part of blastwave has been expanding into the low-density region in the superbubble. This scenario naturally explains the lack of the X-ray emission related to the ejecta and blastwave. The SNR-MC interaction also favours a hadronic contribution to the {\gamma}-ray emission from the CTB 87 region.},

Starting from the observed positions, parallaxes, proper motions, and radial velocities, we construct the distance and total velocity distribution of more than $7$ million stars in our Milky Way, deriving the full 6D phase space information in Galactocentric coordinates. These information are shared in a catalogue, publicly available at http://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/\~{}marchetti/research.html. To search for unbound stars, we then focus on stars with a median total velocity in the Galactic rest frame $\gt 450$ km/s. This cut results in a clean sample of $165$ sources with reliable astrometric parameters and radial velocities. Of these, $28$ stars have probabilities greater than 50 $\\%$ of being unbound from the Galaxy. On this latter sub-sample, we perform orbit integration to characterize the stars' orbital parameter distributions. We find $2$ to $5$ hypervelocity star candidates, stars that are moving on orbits consistent with coming from the Galactic Centre, and $9$ hyper-runaway star candidates, coming from the Galactic disk. Surprisingly, the remaining unbound stars cannot be traced back to the Galaxy, including our two fastest stars (above $700$ km/s). These may constitute the tip of the iceberg of a large extragalactic population or the extreme velocity tail of stellar streams.},

We investigate the possibility that the light curve is dominated by a large number of individual flares and adopt exponential rise and decay models to investigate the symmetry properties of flares. We found that those variations of W2R 1926+42 are predominantly asymmetric with weak tendencies toward positive asymmetry (rapid rise and slow decay). The durations (D) and the amplitudes (F0) of flares can be fit with log-normal distributions. The energy (E) of each flare is also estimated for the first time. There are positive correlations between logD and logE with a slope of 1.36, and between logF0 and logE with a slope of 1.12. Lomb-Scargle periodograms are used to estimate the power spectral density (PSD) shape. It is well described by a power law with an index ranging between -1.1 and -1.5. The sizes of the emission regions, R, are estimated to be in the range of 1.1*10\^{}15 cm - 6.6*10\^{}16 cm. The flare asymmetry is difficult to explain by a light travel time effect but may be caused by differences between the timescales for acceleration and dissipation of high-energy particles in the relativistic jet. A jet-in-jet model also could produce the observed log-normal distributions.},

  abstract      = {X-ray emitting diffuse nebulae around hot stars are observed to have soft-band temperatures in the narrow range [1-3]$\times10^{6}$ K, independent of the stellar wind parameters and the evolutionary stage of the central star. We discuss the origin of this X-ray temperature for planetary nebulae (PNe), Wolf-Rayet nebulae (WR) and interstellar wind bubbles around hot young stars in our Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. We calculate the differential emission measure (DEM) distributions as a function of temperature from previously published simulations and combine these with the X-ray emission coefficient for the 0.3-2.0 keV band to estimate the X-ray temperatures. We find that all simulated nebulae have DEM distributions with steep negative slopes, which is due to turbulent mixing at the interface between the hot shocked stellar wind and the warm photoionised gas. Sharply peaked emission coefficients act as temperature filters and emphasize the contribution of gas with temperatures close to the peak position, which coincides with the observed X-ray temperatures for the chemical abundance sets we consider. Higher metallicity nebulae have lower temperature and higher luminosity X-ray emission. We show that the second temperature component found from spectral fitting to X-ray observations of WR nebulae is due to a significant contribution from the hot shocked stellar wind, while the lower temperature principal component is dominated by nebular gas. We suggest that turbulent mixing layers are the origin of the soft X-ray emission in the majority of diffuse nebulae.},

The VR-distribution of these stars depicts a small asymmetry similar to that seen for the faster rotating thin disk stars near the Sun. We also identify a prominent, slightly retrograde `blob', which traces the metal-poor halo main sequence reported by Gaia Collaboration et al. (2018d). We also find many small clumps especially noticeable in the tails of the velocity distribution of the stars in our sample. Their HR diagrams disclose narrow sequences characteristic of simple stellar populations. This stream-frosting confirms predictions from cosmological simulations, namely that substructure is most apparent amongst the fastest moving stars, typically reflecting more recent accretion events.},

The search was performed in a 30 deg$^{2}$ area centred on the NGC 7232 galaxy group over 8 epochs and observed with a near-daily cadence. The search yielded nine potential variable sources, rejecting the null hypothesis that the flux densities of these sources do not change with 99.9\% confidence. These nine sources displayed flux density variations with modulation indices m $\geq 0.1$ above our flux density limit of 1.5 mJy. They are identified to be compact AGN/quasars or galaxies hosting an AGN, whose variability is consistent with refractive interstellar scintillation. We also detect a highly variable source with modulation index m $ \gt 0.5$ over a time interval of a decade between the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS) and our latest ASKAP observations. We find the source to be consistent with the properties of long-term variability of a quasar. No transients were detected on timescales of days and we place an upper limit $\rho \lt 0.01$ deg$^{2}$ with 95\% confidence for non-detections on near-daily timescales. The future VAST-Wide survey with 36-ASKAP dishes will probe the transient phase space with a similar cadence to our pilot survey, but better sensitivity, and will detect and monitor rarer brighter events.},

The stars in its inner portions orbit the supermassive black hole associated with compact radio source Sgr A* at the orbital speeds of several thousand km/s. The B-type star S2 is currently the best case to test the general theory of relativity as well as other theories of gravity based on its stellar orbit. Yet its orbital period of $\sim 16\,{\rm yr}$ and the eccentricity of $\sim 0.88$ yields the relativistic pericentre shift of $\sim 11'$, which is observationally still difficult to reliably measure due to possible Newtonian perturbations as well as reference-frame uncertainties. A naive way to solve this problem is to find stars with smaller pericentre distances, $r\_{\rm p}\lt120\,{\rm AU}$, and thus more prominent relativistic effects. In this contribution, we show that to detect stars on relativistic orbits is progressively less likely given the volume shrinkage and the expected stellar density distributions. Finally, one arrives to a sparse region, where the total number of bright stars is expected to fall below one. One can, however, still potentially detect stars crossing this region. In this contribution, we provide a simple formula for the detection probability of a star crossing a sparse region. We also examine an approximate time-scale on which the star reappears in the sparse region, i.e. a ``waiting'' time-scale for observers.},

The resulting map of GD-1: (1) extends the apparent length of the stream by $20^\circ$, (2) reveals a plausible location for the progenitor, (3) detects high-contrast gaps along the stream, and (4) indicates the existence of stream members perturbed off the main stream track. These discoveries are only possible because of the exquisite astrometry from Gaia, which permits a clean separation of the stream from Milky Way stars. The additional length and a proper treatment of the progenitor will aid in dynamical modeling of GD-1 for mapping the large-scale dark matter distribution. The complex morphology of the stream points to a turbulent history; detailed phase-space properties of the perturbed stream members could potentially constrain dark matter substructure in the Milky Way.},

Thus it is important to investigate the association between CCSNe and H II regions. In this paper, we present emission line diagnostics of the stellar populations around nearby CCSNe, that include their host H II regions, from the PMAS/PPAK Integral-field Supernova hosts COmpilation (PISCO). We then use BPASS stellar population models to determine the age, metallicity and gas parameters for H II regions associated with CCSNe, contrasting models that consider either single star evolution alone or incorporate interacting binaries. We find binary-star models, that allow for ionizing photon loss, provide a more realistic fit to the observed CCSN hosts with metallicities that are closer to those derived from the oxygen abundance in O3N2. We also find that type II and type Ibc SNe arise from progenitor stars of similar age, mostly from 7 to 45 Myr, which corresponds to stars with masses $\lt$ 20 solar mass . However these two types SNe have little preference in their host environment metallicity measured by oxygen abundance or in progenitor initial mass. We note however that at lower metallicities supernovae are more likely to be of type II.},

  abstract      = {We present a survey for the tightest visual binaries among 0.3-2 Msun members the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). Among 42 targets, we discovered 13 new 0.025-0.15`` companions. Accounting for the Branch bias, we find a companion star fraction (CSF) in the 10-60 au range of 21+8/-5\%, consistent with that observed in other star-forming regions (SFRs) and twice as high as among field stars; this excess is found with a high level of confidence. Since our sample is dominated by disk-bearing targets, this indicates that disk disruption by close binaries is inefficient, or has not yet taken place, in the ONC. The resulting separation distribution in the ONC drops sharply outside 60$\backslash$,au. These findings are consistent with a scenario in which the initial multiplicity properties, set by the star formation process itself, are identical in the ONC and in other SFRs and subsequently altered by the cluster's dynamical evolution. This implies that the fragmentation process does not depend on the global properties of a molecular cloud, but on the local properties of prestellar cores, and that the latter are self-regulated to be nearly identical in a wide range of environments. These results, however, raise anew the question of the origin of field stars as the tight binaries we have discovered will not be destroyed as the ONC dissolves into the galactic field. It thus appears that most field stars formed in regions differ from well-studied SFRs in the Solar neighborhood, possibly due to changes in core fragmentation on Gyr timescales.},

  abstract      = {Context. Transition disks (TDs) are circumstellar disks with inner regions highly depleted in dust. TDs are observed in a small fraction of disk-bearing objects at ages of 1-10 Myr. They are important laboratories to study evolutionary effects in disks, from photoevaporation to planet-disk interactions. Aims. We report the discovery of a large inner dust-empty region in the disk around the very low mass star CIDA 1 (M$\_{\star} \sim 0.1-0.2$ M$\_{\odot}$). Methods. We used ALMA continuum observations at 887$\mu$m, which provide a spatial resolution of $0.''21\times0.''12$ ($\sim$15$\times$8 au in radius at 140 pc). Results. The data show a dusty ring with a clear cavity of radius $\sim$20 au, the typical characteristic of a TD. The emission in the ring is well described by a narrow Gaussian profile. The dust mass in the disk is $\sim$17 M$\_{\oplus}$. CIDA 1 is one of the lowest mass stars with a clearly detected millimeter cavity. When compared to objects of similar stellar mass, it has a relatively massive dusty disk (less than $\sim5$\% of Taurus Class II disks in Taurus have a ratio of $M\_{\rm{disk}}/M\_{\star}$ larger than CIDA 1) and a very high mass accretion rate (CIDA 1 is a disk with one of the lowest values of $M\_{\rm{disk}}/\dot M$ ever observed). In light of these unusual parameters, we discuss a number of possible mechanisms that can be responsible for the formation of the dust cavity (e.g., photoevaporation, dead zones, embedded planets, close binary). We find that an embedded planet of a Saturn mass or a close binary are the most likely possibilities.},

This IRDC has the potential to form high-mass stars and, given the absence of current star formation signatures, it seems to represent the earliest stages of high-mass star formation. We have mapped the whole IRDC with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 1.1 and 1.3 mm in dust continuum and line emission. The dust continuum reveals 22 cores distributed across the IRDC. In this work, we analyze the physical properties of the most massive core, ALMA1, which has no molecular outflows detected in the CO (2-1), SiO (5-4), and H$\_2$CO (3-2) lines. This core is relatively massive ($M$ = 17.6 M$\_\odot$), subvirialized (virial parameter $\alpha\_{vir}=M\_{vir}/M=0.14$), and is barely affected by turbulence (transonic Mach number of 1.2). Using the HCO$^+$ (3-2) line, we find the first detection of infall signatures in a relatively massive, prestellar core (ALMA1) with the potential to form a high-mass star. We estimate an infall speed of 1.54 km s$^{-1}$ and a high accretion rate of 1.96 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ M$\_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. ALMA1 is rapidly collapsing, out of virial equilibrium, more consistent with competitive accretion scenarios rather than the turbulent core accretion model. On the other hand, ALMA1 has a mass $\sim$6 times larger than the clumps Jeans mass, being in an intermediate mass regime ($M\_{J}=2.7\ltM\lesssim$ 30 M$\_\odot$), contrary to what both the competitive accretion and turbulent core accretion theories predict.},

  abstract      = {In this paper we review the operational definition of the so-called main sequence knee (MS-knee), a feature in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) occurring at the low-mass end of the MS. The magnitude of this feature is predicted to be independent of age at fixed chemical composition. For this reason, its difference in magnitude with respect to the MS turn-off (MS-TO) point has been suggested as a possible diagnostic to estimate absolute globular cluster (GC) ages. We first demonstrate that the operational definition of the MS-knee currently adopted in the literature refers to the inflection point of the MS (that we here more appropriately named MS-saddle), a feature that is well distinct from the knee and that cannot be used as its proxy. The MS-knee is only visible in near-infrared CMDs, while the MS-saddle can be also detected in optical-NIR CMDs. By using different sets of isochrones we then demonstrate that the absolute magni- tude of the MS-knee varies by a few tenths of a dex from one model to another, thus showing that at the moment stellar models may not capture the full systematic error in the method. We also demonstrate that while the absolute magnitude of the MS-saddle is almost coincident in different models, it has a systematic dependence on the adopted color combinations which is not predicted by stellar models. Hence, it cannot be used as a reliable reference for absolute age determination. Moreover, when statistical and systematic uncertainties are properly taken into ac- count, the difference in magnitude between the MS-TO and the MS-saddle does not provide absolute ages with better accuracy than other methods like the MS-fitting.},

Using data from a variety of photometric, astrometric and spectroscopic surveys, we calculate the ages, phase space information and orbits for $\sim$125,000 stars covering a wide range of stellar parameters. We find indications that the inner regions of the disk reached high levels of enrichment early, while the outer regions were more substantially enriched in intermediate and recent epochs. We consider these enrichment histories through comparison of the ages of stars, their metallicities, and kinematic properties, such as their angular momentum in the solar neighborhood (which is a proxy for orbital radius). We calculate rates at which the velocity dispersions evolve, investigate the Oort constants for different aged populations (finding a slightly negative $\partial V_{C} / \partial R$ and $\partial V_{R} / \partial R$ for all ages, being most negative for the oldest stars), as well as examine the behavior of the velocity vertex deviation angle as a function of age (which we find to fall from $\sim$15 degrees for the 2 Gyr aged population to $\sim$6 degrees at around 6.5 Gyr of age, after which it remains unchanged). We find evidence for stellar churning, and find that the churned stars have a slightly younger age distribution than the rest of the data.},

Wide fields and longer exposure times are required to offset diminishing star formation rates and lower fluxes to detect useful numbers of events at high redshift. In principle, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) could discover large numbers of early SNe because of its wide fields but only at lower redshifts because of its AB mag 24 - 25 limits. But gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters and massive galaxies could boost flux from ancient SNe and allow LSST to detect them at earlier times.

Another star has an orbit that passes near the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) about 200 Myr ago. Unlike previously discovered blue hypervelocity stars, our sample is metal-poor (-1.5 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -1.0) and quite old ($\gt$1 Gyr). We discuss possible mechanisms for accelerating old stars to such extreme velocities. The high observed space density of this population, relative to potential acceleration mechanisms, implies that that these stars are probably bound to the Milky Way. If they are bound, the discovery of this population would require a local escape speed of around 600 km/s and consequently imply a virial mass of M\_$\{$200$\}$ = 1.4 x 10\^{}$\{$12$\}$ Msun for the Milky Way.},

Detected objects have fluxes of $\sim 0.5$-80 mJy. We remove sub-mm flux due to free-free emission in some objects, leaving a sample of sources detected in dust emission. Under standard assumptions of isothermal, optically thin disks, sub-mm fluxes correspond to dust masses of $\sim 0.5$ to 80 Earth masses. We measure the distribution of disk sizes, and find that disks in this region are particularly compact. Such compact disks are likely to be significantly optically thick. The distributions of sub-mm flux and inferred disk size indicate smaller, lower-flux disks than in lower-density star-forming regions of similar age. Measured disk flux is correlated weakly with stellar mass, contrary to studies in other star forming regions that found steeper correlations. We find a correlation between disk flux and distance from the massive star $\theta^1$ Ori C, suggesting that disk properties in this region are influenced strongly by the rich cluster environment.},

  abstract    = {We use a semi-analytic model for globular cluster (GC) formation built on dark matter merger trees to explore the relative role of formation physics and hierarchical assembly in determining the properties of GC populations. Many previous works have argued that the observed linear relation between total GC mass and halo mass points to a fundamental GC -- dark matter connection or indicates that GCs formed at very high redshift before feedback processes introduced nonlinearity in the baryon-to-dark matter mass relation. We demonstrate that at $M_{\rm vir}(z=0) \gtrsim 10^{11.5} M_{\odot}$, a constant ratio between halo mass and total GC mass is in fact an almost inevitable consequence of hierarchical assembly: by the central limit theorem, it is expected at $z=0$ independent of the GC-to-halo mass relation at the time of GC formation. The GC-to-halo mass relation at $M_{\rm vir}(z=0) < 10^{11.5} M_{\odot}$ is more sensitive to the details of the GC formation process. In our fiducial model, GC formation occurs in galaxies when the gas surface density exceeds a critical value. This model naturally predicts bimodal GC color distributions similar to those observed in nearby galaxies and reproduces the observed relation between GC system metallicity and halo mass. It predicts that the cosmic GC formation rate peaked at $z$ $\sim$ 4, too late for GCs to contribute significantly to the UV luminosity density during reionization.},

  abstract    = {The nature of the Triangulum-Andromeda (TriAnd) system has been debated since the discovery of this distant, low-latitude Milky Way (MW) overdensity more than a decade ago. Explanations for its origin are either as a halo substructure from the disruption of a dwarf galaxy or a distant extension of the Galactic disk. We test these hypotheses using chemical abundances of a dozen TriAnd members from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's 14th Data Release of Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) data to compare to APOGEE abundances of stars with similar metallicity from both the Sagittarius (Sgr) dSph, and the outer MW disk. We find that TriAnd stars are chemically distinct from Sgr across a variety of elements, (C+N), Mg, K, Ca, Mn, and Ni, with a separation in [X/Fe] of about 0.1 to 0.4 dex depending on the element. Instead, the TriAnd stars, with a median metallicity of about -0.8, exhibit chemical abundance ratios similar to those of the lowest metallicity ([Fe/H] ~ -0.7) stars in the outer Galactic disk, and are consistent with expectations of extrapolated chemical gradients in the outer disk of the MW. These results suggest that TriAnd is associated with the MW disk, and, therefore, that the disk extends to this overdensity --- i.e., past a Galactocentric radius of 24 kpc --- albeit vertically perturbed about 7 kpc below the nominal disk midplane in this region of the Galaxy.},

At the critical age of 5 Myr, the targets are at different stages of disk evolution. One of our targets is clearly accreting, as shown by redshifted absorption at free-fall velocities in the He I line and wide wings in H$\alpha$; however, a marginal detection of FUV H$_2$ suggests that little gas is present in the inner disk, although the spectral energy distribution indicates that small dust still remains close to the star. Another target is surrounded by a transitional disk, with an inner cavity in which little sub-micron dust remains. Still, the inner disk shows substantial amounts of gas, accreting onto the star at a probably low, but uncertain rate. The third target lacks both a He I line or FUV emission, consistent with no accretion or inner gas disk; its very weak IR excess is consistent with a debris disk. Different processes occurring in targets with ages close to the disk dispersal time suggest that the end of accretion phase is reached in diverse ways.},

  abstract    = {We use data from Gaia DR2 to constrain the initial-final mass relation (IFMR) for field stars with initial masses $0.9 \lesssim m_{\rm in}/M_{\odot} \lesssim 8$. Precise parallaxes reveal unprecedented substructure in the white dwarf (WD) cooling sequence on the color-magnitude diagram (CMD). We develop a generative model to predict the WD CMD as a function of the initial mass function (IMF), stellar age distribution, and a flexibly parameterized IFMR. We use the model to fit the Gaia CMD of 6400 bright WDs within 100 pc, for which the completeness is well-understood. The resulting best-fit IFMR reproduces much of the observed substructure in the CMD even when including only DA and DB models and assuming a constant star formation history. In our model, the observed bimodality in the CMD is a consequence of flattening in the IFMR at $3 \lesssim m_{\rm in}/M_{\odot} \lesssim 6$, which produces a secondary peak in the WD mass distribution at $0.75 \lesssim m_{\rm WD}/M_{\odot} \lesssim 0.85$. Such an IFMR is broadly consistent with weaker constraints obtained from star clusters in previous work. We demonstrate that if the observed bimodality in the Gaia CMD stems from the IFMR, a visibly bimodal CMD is only predicted for mixed-age stellar populations: in single-age clusters, more massive white dwarfs reach the bottom of the cooling sequence before the first lower-mass white dwarfs appear. This may explain why bimodal cooling sequences have thus far evaded detection in cluster CMDs.},

  title       = {Should Type Ia Supernova Distances be Corrected for their Local Environments?},
  abstract    = {Recent analyses suggest that distance residuals measured from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are correlated with local host galaxy properties within a few kpc of the SN explosion. However, the well-established correlation with the global properties of the host galaxy is nearly as significant, with a shift of 0.06 mag across a low to high mass boundary (the mass step). Here, we investigate whether the stellar masses and rest-frame $u - g$ colors of regions within 1.5 kpc of the SN Ia explosion site are significantly better correlated with SN distance measurements than global properties or properties measured at random locations in SN hosts. With the Foundation and Pantheon datasets, we measure host properties using 271 SNe Ia at $z < 0.1$. At $\lesssim 2 \sigma$ significance, local properties tend to correlate with distance residuals better than properties at random locations, though despite using the largest low-$z$ sample to date we cannot definitively prove that a local correlation is more significant than a random correlation. At the 2.1$\sigma$ level our data also hint that SNe observed by surveys that do not target a pre-selected set of galaxies may have a larger local mass step than SNe from surveys that do, an increase of $0.070 \pm 0.034$ mag. We find some evidence that the correlation of galaxy properties with Hubble residuals is stronger for SNe where both local and global indicators agree, yielding a combined host mass step of $0.099 \pm 0.026$ mag. After correcting for the global mass step, we find that only the local mass step remains significant at $> 2 \sigma$ and we conservatively estimate a systematic shift in H$_0$ measurements of -0.13 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ with an additional uncertainty of 0.13 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $\sim$10% of the present uncertainty.},

  title       = {Accretion and outflow structures within 1000 AU from high-mass protostars with ALMA longest baselines},
  abstract    = {Understanding the formation of massive stars is one of the unsolved problems in modern astronomy. The main difficulty is that the intense radiation from the high-luminosity stars and the thermal pressure from the resulting ionized gas (both insignificant for low-mass stars) may be able to reverse the accretion flow and prevent the star from accreting fresh material. Such feedback effects can naturally be mitigated if accretion proceeds through discs, which is the established mechanism to form sun-like stars. However, recent 3D MHD simulations have shown that accretion on 1000 au scales is through filaments rather than a large disc. This theoretical prediction has never been confirmed via observations owing to the poor linear resolution of previous studies (>1000 au). Here we present the first observational evidence that mass assembly in young high-mass stars forming in protoclusters is predominantly asymmetric and disordered. In particular, we observed the innermost regions around three deeply embedded high-mass protostars with very high spatial resolution (~100 au). We identified multiple massive (several solar masses), warm (50-150 Kelvin) filamentary streamers pointing onto the central sources, which we interpret as multi-directional accretion channels. These structures inhibit the formation of a large, steady disc. Nevertheless, the identification of fast collimated outflows in the three observed systems indicates that (non-steady) compact discs may be present (we measure upper limits on their radii of <80 for one object and <350 astronomical units for the remaining two objects). Our finding contrasts with the simplified classic paradigm of an ordered (and stable) disc/jet system and provides an experimental confirmation of a multi-directional and unsteady accretion model for massive star formation supported by recent 3D (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations.},

  abstract     = {We performed a molecular line survey of 82 high-mass protostellar objects in search for inflow signatures associated with high-mass star formation. Using the H$^{13}$CO$^+$ (1$-$0) line as an optically thin tracer, we detected a statistically significant excess of blue asymmetric line profiles in the HCO$^+$ (1$-$0) transition, but nonsignificant excesses in the HCO$^+$ (3$-$2) and H$_2$CO (2$_{12}$$-$1$_{11}$) transitions. The negative blue excess for the HCN (3$-$2) transition suggests that the line profiles are affected by dynamics other than inflow motion. The HCO$^+$ (1$-$0) transition thus seems to be the suitable tracer of inflow motions in high-mass star-forming regions, as previously suggested. We found 27 inflow candidates that have at least one blue asymmetric profile and no red asymmetric profile, and derived the inflow velocities to be 0.23$-$2.00 km s$^{-1}$ for 20 of them using a simple two-layer radiative transfer model. Our sample is divided into two groups in different evolutionary stages. The blue excess of the group in relatively earlier evolutionary stages was estimated to be slightly higher than that of the other in the HCO$^+$ (1$-$0) transition.},

  title       = {New stellar encounters discovered in the second Gaia data release},
  abstract    = {Passing stars may play an important role in the evolution of our solar system. We search for close stellar encounters to the Sun among all 7.2 million stars in Gaia-DR2 that have six-dimensional phase space data. We characterize encounters by integrating their orbits through a Galactic potential and propagating the correlated uncertainties via a Monte Carlo resampling. After filtering to remove spurious data, we find 694 stars that have median (over uncertainties) closest encounter distances within 5 pc, all occurring within 15 Myr from now. 26 of these have at least a 50% chance of coming closer than 1 pc (and 7 within 0.5 pc), all but one of which are newly discovered here. We further confirm some and refute several other previously-identified encounters, confirming suspicions about their data. The closest encounter in the sample is Gl 710, which has a 95% probability of coming closer than 0.08 pc (17 000 AU). Using mass estimates from Gaia astrometry and multiband photometry for essentially all encounters, we find that Gl 710 also has the largest impulse on the Oort cloud. Using a Galaxy model we compute the completeness of the Gaia-DR2 encountering sample as a function of perihelion time and distance. Only 15% of encounters within 5 pc occurring within +/- 5 Myr of now have been identified, mostly due to the lack of radial velocities for faint and/or cool stars. Accounting for the incompleteness, we infer the present rate of encounters within 1 pc to be 20 +/- 2 per Myr, a quantity that scales quadratically with the encounter distance out to at least several pc.},

We detect the circumstellar material of VLA 1623A, the extended Keplerian disk surrounding VLA 1623A which we call VLA 1623CBdisk, VLA 1623B, VLA 1623W, and L1527 strongly in the polarized emission, at the $\sim1-3\%$ level. We spatially resolve VLA 1623A into two sources, VLA 1623Aa and VLA 1623Ab, separated by $\sim30$ au and located within a cavity of radius $\sim50$ au within the circumbinary Keplerian disk, as well as the edge-on disk of VLA 1623W. The polarization angle of the emission is uniform across each protostellar source and nearly coincides with each disk's minor axis. The offsets between the minor axis and the polarization angle are not uniformly distributed at the $P\lesssim2\times10^{-4}$ level. The circumbinary disk surrounding VLA 1623Aab is azimuthally symmetrically polarized. Each compact source's emission is partially optically thick ($\tau\gtrsim1$) at 872 $\mu$m, complicating interpretations of polarization involving aligned grains. We find evidence against alignment by radiative flux in each source, particularly in the edge-on VLA 1623W and L1527. We detect astrometric offsets between the polarized emission and the total intensity in VLA 1623Aa, VLA 1623Ab, and VLA 1623B, as predicted if self-scattering in the optically thick limit operates. We conclude that self-scattering is likely responsible for disk-scale polarization at 872 $\mu$m in these systems.},

The creation of close, compact-object binaries involves physical processes that are not yet well understood; there are open questions about the manner in which two compact objects come to be close enough to merge within a Hubble time. Here we explore an important, and likely common physical process: mass transfer from a third star in a wider, hierarchical orbit. Mass added to the close binary's components can reduce the time to merger and can even change the nature of an accretor, transforming a white dwarf to a neutron star and/or a neutron star to a black hole. Some accreting white dwarfs in close binaries may even explode as Type Ia supernovae. Given the ubiquity of higher-order multiples, the evolutionary channels we lay out may be important pathways to gravitational mergers, including Type Ia supernovae. Fortunately, these pathways also lead to testable predictions.},

One of the prevailing formation scenarios attributes these split MSs to a bimodal distribution in stellar rotation rates, with most stars belonging to a rapidly rotating population. In this scenario, only a small fraction of stars populating a secondary blue sequence are slowly or non-rotating stars. Here, we focus on the blue MS in the young cluster NGC 1850. We compare the cumulative number fraction of the observed blue-MS stars to that of the high-mass-ratio binary systems at different radii. The cumulative distributions of both populations exhibit a clear anti-correlation, characterized by a highly significant Pearson coefficient of $-0.97$. Our observations are consistent with the possibility that blue-MS stars are low-mass-ratio binaries, and therefore their dynamical disruption is still ongoing. High-mass-ratio binaries, on the other hand, are more centrally concentrated.},

  abstract      = {It is well established that Solar-mass stars gain mass via disk accretion, until the mass reservoir of the disk is exhausted and dispersed, or condenses into planetesimals. Accretion disks are intimately coupled with mass ejection via polar cavities, in the form of jets and less collimated winds, which allow mass accretion through the disk by removing a substantial fraction of its angular momentum. Whether disk accretion is the mechanism leading to the formation of stars with much higher masses is still unclear. Here, we are able to build a comprehensive picture for the formation of an O-type star, by directly imaging a molecular disk which rotates and undergoes infall around the central star, and drives a molecular jet which arises from the inner disk regions. The accretion disk is truncated between 2000-3000au, it has a mass of about a tenth of the central star mass, and is infalling towards the central star at a high rate (6x10\^{}-4 Msun/yr), as to build up a very massive object. These findings, obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at 700au resolution, provide observational proof that young massive stars can form via disk accretion much like Solar-mass stars.},

The extent of the SCUBA-2 850 $\mu$m emission ranges from 0.01 to 0.16 pc with an average of $\sim40\%$ of the total flux being emitted from the extended component. By fitting a modified black-body to the four-point SED at each point along the radial profile we derive the temperature ($T$), spectral index of dust emissivity ($\beta$) and dust column density ($\Sigma$) as a function of radius. For all the sources, the density profile deviates significantly from what is expected for a constant mass-loss rate, showing that all the sources have undergone variations in mass-loss during this evolutionary phase. In combination with results from CO line emission, we determined the dust-to-gas mass ratio for all the sources in our sample. We find that, when sources are grouped according to their chemistry, the resulting average dust-to-gas ratios are consistent with the respective canonical values. However we see a range of values with significant scatter which indicate the importance of including spatial information when deriving these numbers.},

  abstract    = {Context: Protostellar jets in high-mass young stellar objects (HMYSOs) play a key role in the understanding of star formation and provide us with an excellent tool to study fundamental properties of HMYSOs. Aims: We aim at studying the physical and kinematic properties of the near-IR (NIR) jet of IRAS\,13481-6124 from au to parsec scales. Methods: Our study includes NIR data from the Very Large Telescope instruments SINFONI, CRIRES, and ISAAC. Information about the source and its immediate environment is retrieved with SINFONI. The technique of spectro-astrometry is performed with CRIRES to study the jet on au scales. The parsec-scale jet and its kinematic and dynamic properties are investigated using ISAAC. Results: The SINFONI spectra in the $H$ and $K$ band are rich in emission lines that are mainly associated with ejection and accretion processes. Spectro-astrometry is applied to the Br$\gamma$ line, and for the first time, to the Br$\alpha$ line, revealing their jet origin with milliarcsecond-scale photocentre displacements ($11-15$\,au). This allows us to constrain the kinematics of the au-scale jet and to derive its position angle ($\sim216^{\circ}$). ISAAC spectroscopy reveals H$_2$ emission along the parsec-scale jet, which allows us to infer kinematic and dynamic properties of the NIR parsec-scale jet. The mass-loss rate inferred for the NIR jet is $\dot{M}_\mathrm{ejec}\sim10^{-4}\mathrm{\,M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$ and the thrust is $\dot{P}\sim10^{-2}\mathrm{\,M_\odot\,yr^{-1}\,km\,s^{-1}}$ , which is roughly constant for the formation history of the young star. A tentative estimate of the ionisation fraction is derived for the massive jet by comparing the radio and NIR mass-loss rates. An ionisation fraction $\lesssim8\%$ is obtained, which means that the bulk of the ejecta is traced by the NIR jet and that the radio jet only delineates a small portion of it.},

We simultaneously analyse an optical spectrum of the massive globular cluster G280 in M31, obtained with the HIRES spectrograph on the Keck I telescope, and an H-band spectrum obtained with NIRSPEC on Keck II. We discuss the sensitivity of our results to various modifications of the input assumptions, such as different line lists and isochrones and the possible presence of a metallicity spread in G280. When using the most recent version of the Kurucz line list, we measure iron abundances of [Fe/H]=-0.68+/-0.02 from the optical spectrum and [Fe/H]=-0.60+/-0.07 from the infrared spectrum. These values agree well with previous spectroscopic determinations of the metallicity of G280. While the small difference between the optical and infrared measurements is insignificant given the uncertainties, it is also consistent with a metallicity spread similar to that observed in massive GCs such as Omega Cen and G1, and also hinted at by the colour-magnitude diagram of G280. The optical and infrared spectra both indicate an alpha-enhancement of about 0.3-0.4 dex relative to solar-scaled abundances, as typically also observed in Milky Way GCs. It appears that our integrated-light analysis technique also performs well in the H-band. However, complications due to the presence of molecular bands and telluric contamination are more severe in the infrared, and accurate modelling of the coolest giants is more critical.},

  abstract    = {Planetary nebulae (PNe) are an important tool for studying the dynamics and chemical evolution of galaxies in the Local Universe, given their characteristic, bright emission line spectra. The Andromeda Galaxy (M31) provides a unique laboratory for studying PNe in the circumnuclear region, thanks to its proximity and almost uniformly low line-of-sight extinction that ensures observations with high resolution and sensitivity. Using the WIYN/Hydra multi-fiber spectrograph, we have obtained optical (4119--6882{\AA}) spectra of 77 PN candidates selected from Hubble Space Telescope narrow-band imaging, which are located within the central $\sim$500pc region of M31. Among these candidates, 49 (64%) are spectroscopically observed for the first time. The spectra of 300 previously known PNe and H II regions, which primarily reside in the disk, are also taken for comparison. All 77 circumnuclear PN candidates exhibit prominent emission lines, including [O III] $\lambda$5007, [N II] $\lambda$6583, H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$, strongly suggesting that they are genuine PNe. We measured the line fluxes, radial velocities and line widths for all objects, and found that the radial velocities of the circumnuclear PNe generally trace rotation of the inner bulge. We also estimated a dynamical mass of $\sim$6.4$\pm$0.5$\times$10$^{9}$$M_{\odot}$ enclosed within an effective galactocentric radius of 340pc, which is compatible with the previously estimated total stellar mass in this region.},

  abstract      = {Intrinsically luminous giant stars in the Milky Way are the only potential volume-complete tracers of the distant disk, bulge, and halo. The chemical abundances of metal-poor giants also reflect the compositions of the earliest star-forming regions, providing the initial conditions for the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. However, the intrinsic rarity of metal-poor giants combined with the difficulty of efficiently identifying them with broad-band optical photometry has made it difficult to exploit them for studies of the Milky Way. We re-derive a giant star photometric selection using existing public g-band and narrow-band DDO51 photometry obtained in the Kepler field. Our selection is simple and yields a contamination rate of main-sequence stars of $\lesssim$1\% and a completeness of about 80\% for giant stars with $T\_{\rm eff} \lesssim 5250$ K - subject to the selection function of the spectroscopic surveys used to estimate these rates, and the magnitude range considered ($11\lesssim g\lesssim 15$). While the DDO51 filter is known to be sensitive to stellar surface gravity, we further show that the mid-infrared colours of DDO51-selected giants are strongly correlated with spectroscopic metallicity. This extends the infrared selection developed by Schlaufman {\amp} Casey, demonstrating that the principal contaminants in their selection can be efficiently removed by the photometric separation of dwarfs and giants. This implies that any similarly efficient dwarf/giant discriminant (e.g., Gaia) can be used with WISE colours to select samples of giant stars with high completeness and low contamination. We employ our photometric selection to identify three metal-poor giant candidates in the Kepler field with global asteroseismic parameters and find that masses inferred for these three stars using standard asteroseismic scaling relations are systematically over-estimated by 20-175\%.

Here, we reevaluate the status of this interesting star using Gaia DR2. Our results strongly suggest that PSS 309-6 could be a Population II star as the value of its V component is close to -220 km/s, which is typical for halo stars in the immediate solar neighborhood. Kapteyn's star is the nearest known halo star and PSS 309-6 exhibits similar kinematic and photometric signatures. Its properties also resemble those of 2MASS J15484023-3544254, which was once thought to be the nearest cool white dwarf but was later reclassified as K-type subdwarf. Although it is virtually certain that PSS 309-6 is not a nearby white dwarf but a more distant Population II subdwarf, further spectroscopic information, including radial velocity measurements, is necessary to fully characterize this probable member of the Galactic halo.},

We detect the progenitor star in $\gt$40 epochs of HST and Spitzer imaging covering 12.9 years to 43 days before discovery. While the progenitor luminosity was roughly constant for most of this period, there was a $\sim$20\% increase in its $4.5~\mu$m luminosity over the final 3 years before explosion. We interpret the bright mid-infrared emission as a signature of circumstellar dust around the progenitor system. Using the pre-explosion photometry and assuming some circumstellar dust, we find the progenitor is most likely a red supergiant with $\log(L/L\_{\odot}) = 4.9$ and $T = 3350$ K, obscured by a $\gt2\times10^{-5}~M\_{\odot}$ dust shell with $R = 4000~R\_{\odot}$ and $T = 960$ K. Comparing to single-star evolutionary tracks, we find that the progenitor star had an initial mass of $13~M\_{\odot}$ and a mass-loss rate of $2\times10^{-7}~M\_{\odot}~\text{yr}^{-1}$, consistent with the population of SN II progenitor stars.},

We confirm that our method can provide reasonable agreement with an exact numerical solution of both the hydrodynamics and chemistry while being significantly less computationally expensive, allowing a large grid of models varying multiple input parameters to be run. We present results using this method to illustrate how the chemistry is affected not only by the collapse model adopted, but also by the large number of unknown physical and chemical parameters. Models which are initially gravitationally unstable predict similar abundances despite differing densities and collapse timescales, while ambipolar diffusion produces more extended inner depleted regions which are not seen in observations of prestellar cores. Molecular observations are capable of discriminating between modes of collapse despite the unknown values of various input parameters. We also investigate the evolution of the ambipolar diffusion timescale for a range of collapse modes, metallicities and cosmic ray ionization rates, finding that it remains comparable to or larger than the collapse timescale during the initial stages for all models we consider, but becomes smaller at later evolutionary stages. This confirms that ambipolar diffusion is an important process for diffuse gas, but becomes less significant as cores collapse to higher densities.},

  abstract    = {Emission from protostars at centimeter radio wavelengths has been shown to trace the free-free emission arising from ionizing shocks as a result of jets and outflows driven by protostars. Therefore, measuring properties of protostars at radio frequencies can provide valuable insights into the nature of their outflows and jets. We present a C-band (4.1 cm and 6.4 cm) survey of all known protostars (Class 0 and Class I) in Perseus as part of the VLA Nascent Disk and Multiplicity (VANDAM) Survey. We examine the known correlations between radio flux density and protostellar parameters such as bolometric luminosity and outflow force, for our sample. We also investigate the relationship between radio flux density and far-infrared line luminosities from Herschel. We show that free-free emission originates most likely from J-type shocks; however, the large scatter indicates that those two types of emission probe different time and spatial scales. Using C-band fluxes, we removed an estimation of free-free contamination from the corresponding Ka-band (9 mm) flux densities that primarily probe dust emission from embedded disks. We find that the compact ($<$~1") dust emission is lower for Class I sources (median dust mass 96 M$_{\oplus}$) relative to Class 0 (248 M$_{\oplus}$), but several times higher than in Class II (5-15 M$_{\oplus}$). If this compact dust emission is tracing primarily the embedded disk, as is likely for many sources, this result provides evidence for decreasing disk masses with protostellar evolution, with sufficient mass for forming giant planet cores primarily at early times.},

  abstract      = {Recent observational studies have demonstrated that the complex stellar system Terzan 5 (Ter 5) harbours multiple populations of stars. Several models have attempted to interpret the large age difference of several Gyrs between the dominant populations, but none have been universally accepted. We propose a new scenario whereby a collision between a metal-poor Ter 5 and a giant molecular cloud (GMC) serves as a catalyst for the generation of a super-solar population of stars. Using numerical simulations of this new ``GC-GMC'' collision scenario we demonstrate that, within a time frame of several Gyrs, our synthetic Ter 5 was capable of interacting with a metal-rich GMC in the central region of the Galaxy. As a consequence of this, our simulated globular cluster (GC) is able to capture enough gas from the colliding GMC to form a new population of metal-rich stars. Furthermore, the younger population created from the high-density regions of the captured gas is shown to have a stronger central mass concentration than the older metal-poor one, which is consistent with observations. A chemical link between Ter 5 and the bulge population of the Milky Way has long been observed and these simulations finally provide evidence for their similarities. Our model rationalises the 5 Gyrs of quiescence observed between the two dominant populations of Ter 5 and justifies the existence of the young generation. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the new scenario in the context of the observed physical properties of Ter 5.},

Simulations have shown that gravitational collapse and disk formation in primordial gas yield dense stellar clusters. In this paper, we focus particularly on the formation of protostellar binary systems, and aim to quantify their properties during the early stage of their evolution. For this purpose, we combine the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code GRADSPH with the astrochemistry package KROME. The GRADSPH-KROME framework is employed to investigate the collapse of primordial clouds in the high-density regime, exploring the fragmentation process and the formation of binary systems. We observe a strong dependence of fragmentation on the strength of the turbulent Mach number $\mathcal{M}$ and the rotational support parameter $\beta{}$. Rotating clouds show significant fragmentation, and have produced several Pop.\~{}III proto-binary systems. We report maximum and minimum mass accretion rates of $2.31 \times 10^{-1}$\~{}M$\_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and $2.18\times 10^{-4}$\~{}M$\_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$.

In order to evaluate our model, we build a synthetic stellar halo from mergers of nine satellites in the Milky Way.

We compare the results from StarGO against that from a Friends-of-Friends (FoF) based method in the space of orbital energy and angular momentum. We show that StarGO is able to systematically identify more satellites and achieve higher number fraction of identified stars for most of the satellites within the extracted volume.

  abstract      = {Understanding the history and evolution of small bodies, such as dust grains and comets, in planet-forming disks is very important to reveal the architectural laws responsible for the creation of planetary systems. These small bodies in cold regions of the disks are typically considered as mixtures of dust particles with molecular ices, where ices cover the surface of a dust core or are actually physically mixed with dust. Whilst the first case, ice-on-dust, has been intensively studied in the laboratory in recent decades, the second case, ice-mixed-with-dust, present uncharted territory. This work is the first laboratory study of the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of water ice mixed with amorphous carbon and silicate grains. We show that the kinetics of desorption of H2O ice depends strongly on the dust/ice mass ratio, probably, due to the desorption of water molecules from a large surface of fractal clusters composed of carbon or silicate grains. In addition, it is shown that water ice molecules are differently bound to silicate grains in contrast to carbon. The results provide a link between the structure and morphology of small cosmic bodies and the kinetics of desorption of water ice included in them.},

We have combined the ``local-density-driven cluster formation model'' of Parmentier {\amp} Pfalzner (2013) with direct N-body simulations of clusters following instantaneous gas expulsion. We have studied the relation between cluster dissolution time, $t\_{dis}$, and cluster ``initial'' mass, $M\_{init}$, defined as the cluster $\{$mass at the end of the dynamical response to gas expulsion (i.e. violent relaxation), when the cluster age is 20-30 Myr$\}$. We consider the ``initial'' mass to be consistent with other works which neglect violent relaxation. The model clusters formed with a high star formation efficiency (SFE -- i.e. gas mass fraction converted into stars) follow a tight mass-dependent relation, in agreement with previous theoretical studies. However, the low-SFE models present a large scatter in both the ``initial'' mass and the dissolution time, and a shallower mass-dependent relation than high-SFE clusters. Both groups differ in their structural properties on the average. Combining two populations of clusters, high- and low-SFE ones, with domination of the latter, yields a cluster dissolution time for the solar neighborhood in agreement with that inferred from observations, without any additional destructive processes such as giant molecular cloud encounters. An apparent mass-independent relation may emerge for our low-SFE clusters when we neglect low-mass clusters (as expected for extra-galactic observations), although more simulations are needed to investigate this aspect.},

Our sample spans a wide range of metallicities (-1.5 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ 0.3), yet none show abundance ratios of [K/Fe] or [Mg/Fe] that are as extreme as those observed in NGC 2419. If confirmed, the identified sample of stars represents evidence that the nucleosynthetic process producing the anomalous abundances ratios of [K/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] probably occurs at a wide range of metallicities. This would suggest that pollution scenarios that are limited to early epochs (such as Population III supernovae) are an unlikely explanation, although they cannot be ruled out entirely. This sample is expected to help guide modelling attempts to explain the origin of the Mg-K abundance signature.},

  abstract      = {By far, the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of Galactic open clusters have been considered proto-types of single stellar populations. By using photometry in ultraviolet and optical bands we discovered that the nearby young cluster NGC6705 (M11) exhibits an extended main-sequence turn off (eMSTO) and a broadened main-sequence (MS). This is the first evidence of multiple stellar populations in a Galactic open cluster. By using high-resolution VLT spectra we provide direct evidence that the multiple sequences along the CMD correspond to stellar populations with different rotation rates. Specifically, the blue MS is formed of slow-rotating stars, while red-MS stars are fast rotators. Moreover, we exploit photometry from Gaia DR2 to show that three Galactic open clusters, namely NGC2099, NGC2360, and NGC2818, exhibit the eMSTO, thus suggesting that it is a common feature among these objects. Our previous work on the Large Magellanic Cloud star cluster NGC1818 shows that slowly and fastly-rotating stars populate the blue and red MS observed in its CMD. The similarities between M11 and the young clusters of the Magellanic Clouds suggest that rotation is responsible for the appearance of multiple populations in the CMDs of both Milky Way open clusters and Magellanic Clouds young clusters.},

  year          = {2018},

  abstract      = {Young massive stars in the halo are supposed to be runaway stars from the Galactic disk. Possible ejection scenarios are binary supernova ejections (BSE) or dynamical ejections from star clusters (DE). Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) are extreme runaway stars that are potentially unbound to the Galaxy. Powerful acceleration mechanisms like the tidal disruption of a binary by a supermassive black hole are required. Hence, HVSs are believed to originate in the Galactic center (GC). Gaia DR2 offers the opportunity to study HVSs in an unprecedented manner. We revisit the most interesting HVSs, i.e., 15 stars for which proper motions with the Hubble Space Telescope were obtained in the pre-Gaia era, to unravel their origin. By carrying out kinematic analyses in three different Galactic mass models, kinematic properties are obtained that help to constrain the spatial origins of the HVSs. While HVSs previously considered unbound remain unbound in two Galactic potentials, most stars become bound in the most massive Galactic model. For nine stars (including five unbound candidates), the GC can be ruled out as spatial origin at $2\sigma$ confidence. Using optical and infrared photometry to determine its spectrophotometric distance, we confirm that HVS3 originates in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Our results suggest that a large fraction of the HVSs are actually disk runaway stars launched close to or beyond Galactic escape velocities. Population synthesis models predict that only a small fraction of the HVSs stems from BSE. Furthermore, a maximum ejection velocity of 540$\backslash$,km/s is predicted for BSE and a similar limit has been found for DE. The ejection velocities of five of our non-GC HVSs are close to or above this limit, calling for the existence of another dynamical ejection mechanism (e.g., massive perturbers such as intermediate mass black holes) besides the classical scenarios mentioned above.},

A dusty disk is seen deeply embedded in a flattened envelope, with an intensity jump in dust continuum at \~{} 350 GHz. It is nearly edge-on and is almost exactly perpendicular to the jet axis. It has a size of \~{} 30 au along the major axis. It is geometrically thick, indicating that the (sub)millimeter light emitting grains have yet to settle to the midplane. Its inner part is expected to have transformed into a Keplerian rotating disk with a radius of \~{} 10 au. A rotating disk atmosphere and a compact rotating bipolar outflow are detected in SO. The outflow fans out from the inner disk surfaces and is rotating in the same direction as the flattened envelope, and hence could trace a disk wind carrying away angular momentum from the inner disk. From the rotation of the disk atmosphere, the protostellar mass is estimated to be $\lt$\~{} 50 M\_Jup. Together with results from the literature, our result favors a model where the disk radius grows linearly with the protostellar mass, as predicted by models of pre-stellar dense core evolution that asymptotes to an $r^{-1}$ radial profile for both the column density and angular velocity.},

  abstract      = {We construct from Gaia DR2 an extensive and very pure ($\lesssim 0.2\\%$ contamination) catalog of wide binaries containing main-sequence (MS) and white dwarf (WD) components within 200 fpc of the Sun. The public catalog contains, after removal of clusters and higher-order multiples, $\gt$50,000 MS/MS, $\gt$3,000 WD/MS, and nearly 400 WD/WD binaries with projected separations of $50 \lesssim s/{\rm AU} \lt 50,000$. Accounting for incompleteness and selection effects, we model the separation distribution of each class of binaries as a broken power-law, revealing marked differences between the three populations. The separation distribution of MS/MS systems is nearly consistent with a single power-law of slope $-1.6$ over at least $500 \lt s/{\rm AU} \lt 50,000$, with marginal steepening at $s \gt 10,000$ AU. In contrast, the separation distributions of WD/MS and WD/WD binaries show distinct breaks at $\sim$ 3,000 AU and $\sim$1,500 AU, respectively: they are flatter than the MS/MS distribution at small separations and steeper at large separations. Using binary population synthesis models, we show that these breaks are unlikely to be caused by external factors but can be explained if the WDs incur a kick of $\sim$ 0.75 km s$^{-1}$ during their formation, presumably due to asymmetric mass loss. The data rule out typical kick velocities above 2km s$^{-1}$. Our results imply that most wide binaries with separations exceeding a few thousand AU become unbound during post-MS evolution.},

Space based trigonometric parallaxes are now available for a larger sample using the second data release of GAIA. Aims: We aim to derive a high quality approach for selection criteria of trigonometric parallaxes for planetary nebulae and discuss possible caveats and restrictions in the use of this data release. Methods: A few hundred sources from previous distance scale surveys were manually cross identified with data from the second GAIA data release (DR2) as coordinate based matching does not work reliable. The data are compared with the results of previous distance scales and to the results of a recent similar study, which was using the first data release GAIA DR1. Results: While the few available previous ground based and HST trigonometric parallaxes match perfectly to the new data sets, older statistical distance scales, reaching larger distances, do show small systematic differences. Restricting to those central stars, were photometric colors of GAIA show a negligible contamination by the surrounding nebula, the difference is negligible for radio flux based statistical distances, while those derived from H-alpha surface brightness still show minor differences. The DR2 study significantly improves the previous recalibration of the statistical distance scales using DR1/TGAS.},

  abstract      = {An unsettled question concerning the formation and distribution of massive stars is whether they must be born in massive clusters and, if found in less dense environments, whether they must have migrated there. With the advent of wide-area digital photometric surveys, it is now possible to identify massive stars away from prominent Galactic clusters without bias. In this study we consider 40 candidate OB stars found in the field around the young massive cluster, Westerlund 2, by Mohr-Smith et al (2017): these are located inside a box of 1.5x1.5 square degrees and are selected on the basis of their extinctions and K magnitudes. We present VLT/X-shooter spectra of two of the hottest O stars, respectively 11 and 22 arcmin from the centre of Westerlund 2. They are confirmed as O4V stars, with stellar masses likely to be in excess of 40 Msun. Their radial velocities relative to the non-binary reference object, MSP 182, in Westerlund 2 are -29.4 +/- 1.7 and -14.4 +/- 2.2 km/s, respectively. Using Gaia DR2 proper motions we find that between 8 and 11 early O/WR stars in the studied region (including the two VLT targets, plus WR 20c and WR 20aa) could have been ejected from Westerlund 2 in the last one million years. This represents an efficiency of massive-star ejection of up to 25\%. On sky, the positions of these stars and their proper motions show a near N--S alignment. We discuss the possibility that these results are a consequence of prior sub-cluster merging combining with dynamical ejection.},

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in the B configuration at K band, and in the A configuration at both Ku and C bands, in order to image the radio continuum emission towards 25 H$\_2$O maser sites with an angular resolution and thermal rms of the order of $0.1''$ and 10 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$, respectively. These targets add to our pilot study of 11 maser sites presented in Moscadelli et al. (2016). The sample of H$\_2$O maser sites was selected among those regions having an accurate distance measurement, obtained through maser trigonometric parallaxes, and H$\_2$O maser luminosities in excess of 10$^{-6}$ L$\_{\odot}$. Results. We present high-resolution radio continuum images of 33 sources belonging to 25 star-forming regions. In each region, we detect radio continuum emission within a few 1000 au of the H$\_2$O masers' position; 50\% of the radio continuum sources are associated with bolometric luminosities exceeding 5 $\times$ 10$^{3}$ L$\_{\odot}$, including W33A and G240.32$+$0.07. We provide a detailed spectral index analysis for each radio continuum source, based on the integrated fluxes at each frequency, and produce spectral index maps with the multi-frequency-synthesis deconvolution algorithm of CASA. The radio continuum emission traces thermal bremsstrahlung in (proto)stellar winds and jets, with flux densities at 22 GHz below 3 mJy, and spectral index values between $-0.1$ and 1.3. We prove a strong correlation ($r\gt$0.8) between the radio continuum luminosity (L$\_{\rm rad}$) and the H$\_2$O maser luminosity (L$\_{\rm H\_2O}$) of ($\rm L\_{8GHz}/mJy\times kpc^2)=10^{3.8}\times(L\_{H\_2O}/L\_{\odot})^{0.74}$. Since H$\_2$O masers are excited through shocks driven by (proto)stellar winds and jets, these results provide support to the idea that the radio continuum emission around young stars is dominated by shock-ionization.},

We present high-resolution ALMA maps of the 12CO and 13CO J=3-2 lines, the 0.9 mm continuum distribution, and some high-excitation molecular lines in R Aqr. The maps, which have resolutions ranging between 40 milliarcsecond (mas) and less than 20 mas, probe the circumstellar regions at suborbital scales as the distance between the stars is \~{} 40 mas. Our observations show the gravitational effects of the secondary on the stellar wind. The AGB star was identified in our maps from the continuum and molecular line data, and we estimated the probable position of the secondary from a new estimation of the orbital parameters. The (preliminary) comparison of our maps with theoretical predictions is surprisingly satisfactory and the main expected gravitational effects are directly mapped for the first time. We find a strong focusing in the equatorial plane of the resulting wind, which shows two plumes in opposite directions that have different velocities and very probably correspond to the expected double spiral due to the interaction. Our continuum maps show the very inner regions of the nascent bipolar jets, at scales of some AU. Continuum maps obtained with the highest resolution show the presence of a clump that very probably corresponds to the emission of the ionized surroundings of the WD and of a bridge of material joining both stars, which is likely material flowing from the AGB primary to the accretion disk around the WD secondary.},

Recently reported extraordinary bursts in the methanol maser emission may be the observational signature of accretion events in deeply embedded HMYSOs. Aims: We analyze the light curve of 6.7 GHz methanol masers in S255IR-NIRS3 during the 2015-2016 burst. Methods: 8.5-year monitoring data with an average sampling interval of 5 days were obtained with the Torun 32 m radio telescope. Archival data were added, extending the time series to \~{}27 years. Results: The maser emission showed moderate (25-30\%) variability on timescales of months to years over \~{}23 years since its discovery. The main burst was preceded by a one-year increase of the total flux density by a factor of 2.5, then it grew by a factor of 10 over \~{}0.4 years and declined by a factor of 8 during the consecutive 2.4 years. The peak maser luminosity was a factor of 24.5 higher than the pre-burst quiescent value. The light curves of individual features showed considerable diversity but indicated a general trend of suppression of the maser emission at blueshifted ($\lt$4.7 km s$^{-1}$) velocities when the redshifted emission rapidly grew and new emission features appeared at velocities $\gt$5.8 km s$^{-1}$. This new emission provided a contribution of about 80\% to the maser luminosity around the peak of the burst. Conclusions: The onset of the maser burst exactly coincides with that of the infrared burst estimated from the motion of the light echo. This strongly supports the radiative pumping scheme of the maser transition. The growth of the maser luminosity is the result of an increasing volume of gas where the maser inversion is achieved.},

  abstract    = {It has been suggested that IC4499 is one of the very few old globulars to not host multiple populations with light-element variations. To follow-up on this very interesting result, here we make use of accurate HST photometry and FLAMES@VLT high-resolution spectroscopy to investigate in more detail the stellar population properties of this system. We find that the red giant branch of the cluster is clearly bimodal in near-UV -- optical colour-magnitude diagrams, thus suggesting that IC4499 is actually composed by two sub-populations of stars with different nitrogen abundances. This represents the first detection of multiple populations in IC4499. Consistently, we also find that one star out of six is Na-rich to some extent, while we do not detect any evidence of intrinsic spread in both Mg and O. The number ratio between stars with normal and enriched nitrogen is in good agreement with the number ratio - mass trend observed in Galactic globular clusters. Also, as typically found in other systems, nitrogen rich stars are more centrally concentrated than normal stars, although this result cannot be considered conclusive because of the limited field of view covered by our observations (~$1r_h$). On the contrary, we observe that both the RGB UV color spread, which is a proxy of N variations, and Na abundance variations, are significantly smaller than those observed in Milky Way globular clusters with mass and metallicity comparable to IC4499. The modest N and Na spreads observed in this system can be tentatively connected to the fact that IC4499 likely formed in a disrupted dwarf galaxy orbiting the Milky Way, as previously proposed based on its orbit.},

  title       = {The supernova rate beyond the optical radius},
  abstract    = {Many spiral galaxies have extended outer H~I disks and display low levels of star formation, inferred from the far-ultraviolet emission detected by {\it GALEX}, well beyond the optical radius. Here, we investigate the supernova (SN) rate in the outskirts of galaxies, using the largest and most homogeneous set of nearby supernovae (SNe) from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS). While SN rates have been measured with respect to various galaxy properties, such as stellar mass and metallicity, their relative frequency in the outskirts versus the inner regions has not yet been studied. Understanding the SN rate as a function of intragalactic environment has many ramifications, including the interpretation of LIGO observations, the formation of massive stars, and the puzzlingly high velocity dispersion of the outer H~I disk. Using data from the LOSS survey, we find that the rate beyond the optical radius of spiral galaxies is $2.5 \pm 0.5$ SNe per millennium, while dwarf galaxies host $ 4.0 \pm 2.2$ SNe per millennium. The rates of core-collapse SNe (that may collapse to form the massive black holes detected by LIGO/Virgo) in the outer disks of spirals is $1.5 \pm 0.15$ SNe per millennium and in dwarf galaxies is $2.6 \pm 1.5$ SNe per millennium. Core-collapse SNe in spiral outskirts contribute $7600 \pm 1700$\,SNe\,~Gpc$^{-3}$\,yr$^{-1}$ to the volumetric rate, and dwarf galaxies have a rate of $31,000 \pm 18,000$\,SNe\,Gpc$^{-3}$\,yr$^{-1}$. The relative ratio of core-collapse to Type Ia SNe is comparable in the inner and outer parts of spirals, and in dwarf galaxies.},

  title       = {The unexpected kinematics of multiple populations in NGC6362: do binaries play a role?},
  abstract    = {We present a detailed analysis of the kinematic properties of the multiple populations (MPs) in the low-mass Galactic globular cluster NGC6362 based on a sample of about 500 member stars for which radial velocities (RVs), Fe and Na abundances have been homogeneously derived. At distances from the cluster center larger than about 0.5 $r_h$, we find that first (FG - Na-poor) and second generation (SG - Na-rich) stars show hints of different line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles, with FG stars being dynamically hotter. This is the first time that differences in the velocity dispersion of MPs are detected by using only RVs. While kinematic differences between MPs in globular clusters are usually described in terms of anisotropy differences driven by the different radial distributions, this explanation seems hardly viable for NGC6362, where SG and FG stars are spatially mixed. We demonstrate that the observed difference in the velocity dispersion profiles can be accounted for by the effect of binary stars. In fact, thanks to our multi-epoch RV measurements we find that the binary fraction is significantly larger in the FG sample (f~14%) than in SG population (f<1%), and we show that such a difference can inflate the velocity dispersion of FG with respect to SG by the observed amount in the relevant radial range. Our results nicely match the predictions of state-of-the art $N$-body simulations of the co-evolution of MPs in globular clusters that include the effect of binaries.},

Our method picks out the known clusters of young stars around $\gamma^2$ Velorum and NGC-2547, but also identifies other over-densities that may represent previously unknown clusters. There are clear differences in the spatial distributions of the low-mass and the high-mass OB populations, suggesting either that the structure and dynamics of these populations has evolved separately or that the initial mass function can vary considerably on small scales within a single association.},

We have observed eight of these candidates spectroscopically, leading to the confirmation of 7 out of 8 as PNe. All but one of our sample of newly detected PNe appear to be of Type I chemistry with very large [NII]/H$\alpha$ ratios. This indicates that our selection method heavily favours detection of this kind of PN. Cornish is a low Galactic latitude survey where young objects and Type I PNe (thought to derive from higher mass progenitors) are more plentiful, but where optical extinction is large. The very high success rate in correctly identifying PNe in this zone proves the efficacy of our radio and multiple multi-wavelength diagnostic tools used to successfully predict and then confirm their PN nature, at least in the cases where an optical counterpart is found and has been observed. The study reinforces the effective use of a combination of multi-wavelength and optical data in the identification of new Galactic PNe and especially those of Type I chemistries whose dusty environments often prevents their easy detection in the optical regime alone.},

However, this effect only shows when the number of this Cepheid type makes up a significant fraction of the total sample. We also analyze the sample selection effect on the Hubble constant.},

  abstract      = {It has recently been noted that there seems to be a strong correlation between planetary nebulae with close binary central stars, and highly enhanced recombination line abundances. We present new deep spectra of seven objects known to have close binary central stars, and find that the heavy element abundances derived from recombination lines exceed those from collisionally excited lines by factors of 5-95, placing several of these nebulae among the most extreme known abundance discrepancies. This study nearly doubles the number of nebulae known to have a binary central star and an extreme abundance discrepancy. A statistical analysis of all nebulae with measured recombination line abundances reveals no link between central star surface chemistry and nebular abundance discrepancy, but a clear link between binarity and the abundance discrepancy, as well as an anti-correlation between abundance discrepancies and nebular electron densities: all nebulae with a binary central star with a period of less than 1.15 days have an abundance discrepancy factor exceeding 10, and an electron density less than $\sim$1000 cm$^{-3}$; those with longer period binaries have abundance discrepancy factors less than 10 and much higher electron densities. We find that [O\~{}$\{$$\backslash$sc ii$\}$] density diagnostic lines can be strongly enhanced by recombination excitation, while [S\~{}$\{$$\backslash$sc ii$\}$] lines are not. These findings give weight to the idea that extreme abundance discrepancies are caused by a nova-like eruption from the central star system, occurring soon after the common-envelope phase, which ejects material depleted in hydrogen, and enhanced in CNONe but not in third-row elements.},

In this paper, we present a detailed spectroscopic study of brighter (M\_g $\lt$ 12.4) white dwarfs in Messier 67, and, in combination with previously-published proper motion membership determinations, we identify a clean, representative sample of cluster white dwarfs, including 13 members with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, at least one of which is a candidate double degenerate, and 5 members with helium-dominated atmospheres. Using this sample we test multiple predictions surrounding the final stages of stellar evolution in solar type stars. In particular, the stochasticity of the integrated mass lost by \~{}1.5 solar mass stars is less than 7\% of the white dwarf remnant mass. We identify white dwarfs likely resulting from binary evolution, including at least one blue straggler remnant and two helium core white dwarfs. We observe no evidence of a significant population of helium core white dwarfs formed by enhanced mass loss on the red giant branch of the cluster. The distribution of white dwarf atmospheric compositions is fully consistent with that in the field, limiting proposed mechanisms for the suppression of helium atmosphere white dwarf formation in star clusters. In short, the white dwarf population of Messier 67 is fully consistent with basic predictions of single- and multiple-star stellar evolution theories for solar metallicity stars.},

Spirals should form in both $\lt$v\_phi$\gt$ and $\lt$v\_R$\gt$ whenever a massive substructure, such as the Sgr dwarf galaxy, passes through the Galactic plane. The model yields similar spirals to those observed in both $\lt$v\_phi$\gt$ and $\lt$v\_R$\gt$. The primary driver is the component of the tidal force that lies in the plane. We investigate the longevity of the spirals and the mass of the substructure, but the approximations inherent in the model make quantitative results unreliable.

  abstract      = {Globular Clusters (GCs) in the Milky Way represent the ideal laboratory to establish the age of the oldest stellar populations and to measure the color-magnitude relation of stars. Infrared (IR) photometry of these objects provides a new opportunity to accomplish this task. In particular, at low stellar masses, the stellar main sequence (MS) in an IR color-magnitude diagram (CMD) exhibits a sharp ``kink'' (due to opacity effects in M dwarfs), such that lower mass and cooler dwarfs become bluer in the F110W - F160W color baseline and not redder. This inversion of the color-magnitude relation offers the possibility to fit GC properties using IR imaging, and to reduce their uncertainties. Here, we used the IR channel of the Wide Field Camera 3 onboard the Hubble Space Telescope to obtain new, deep high-resolution photometry of the old metal-poor GC NGC6397. From the analysis of the GC CMD, we revealed below the MS ``kink'' the presence of two MSs with different chemical composition. We derived the cluster fiducial line and we compared it with a grid of isochrones over a large range of parameter space, allowing age, metallicity, distance and reddening to vary freely within reasonable selected ranges. We derived an age of 12.6 Gyr with a random uncertainty sigma \~{} 0.7 Gyr. These results confirm that the analysis of the IR color-magnitude of stars provide a valuable tool to measure the GC ages and offers a new venue to determine their absolute age to sub-Gyr accuracy with next generation IR telescopes.},

This cluster displays a clear extended main sequence turn-off (eMSTO), a phenomenon previously studied mainly in young and intermediate age massive clusters in the Magellanic clouds. The main sequence of NGC~2818 is extremely narrow, with a width of $\sim0.01$ magnitudes (G$_{\rm BP} - $ G$_{\rm RP}$), suggesting very low levels of differential extinction. Using VLT/FLAMES spectroscopy of 60 cluster members to measure the rotational velocity of the stars (Vsini) we find that stars on the red side of the eMSTO have high Vsini ($>160$~km/s) while stars on the blue side have low Vsini ($<160$~km/s), in agreement with model predictions. The cluster also follows the previously discovered trend between the age of the cluster and the extent of the eMSTO. We conclude that stellar rotation is the likely cause of the eMSTO phenomenon.},

The observed spectra of the sample (hydrogen-poor) stars (LEID 39048 and LEID 34225) show weaker MgH bands unlike in the spectra of the normal comparison giants (LEID 61067 and LEID 32169). The magnesium abundance derived from MgH bands is less by 0.3 dex or more for LEID 39048 and LEID 34225, than that derived from Mg I lines. This difference, cannot be reconciled by making the changes to the stellar parameters within the uncertainties. This difference in the magnesium abundances derived from Mg I lines and from the MgH band is unacceptable. This difference is attributed to the hydrogen-deficiency or helium-enhancement in their atmospheres. These metal rich hydrogen-poor or helium-rich giants provide an important link to the evolution of the metal-rich sub population of Omega Cen. These stars provide the first direct spectroscopic evidence for the presence of the He-enhancement in the metal rich giants of Omega Cen.},

  title       = {Protostellar half-life: new methodology and estimates},
  abstract    = {(Abridged) Protostellar systems evolve from prestellar cores, through the deeply embedded stage and then disk-dominated stage, before they end up on the main sequence. Knowing how much time a system spends in each stage is crucial for understanding how stars and associated planetary systems form, because a key constraint is the time available to form such systems. Equally important is understanding what the spread in these time scales is. The most commonly used method for inferring protostellar ages is to assume the lifetime of one evolutionary stage, and then scale this to the relative number of protostars in the other stages, i.e., assuming steady state. This method does not account for the underlying age distribution and apparent stochasticity of star formation, nor that relative populations are not in steady state. To overcome this, we propose a new scheme where the lifetime of each protostellar stage follows a distribution based on the formalism of sequential nuclear decay. The main assumptions are: Class 0 sources follow a straight path to Class III sources, the age distribution follows a binomial distribution, and the star-formation rate is constant. The results are that the half-life of Class 0, Class I, and Flat sources are (2.4+/-0.2)%, (4.4+/-0.3)%, and (4.3+/-0.4)% of the Class II half-life, respectively, which translates to 47+/-4, 88+/-7, and 87+/-8 kyr, respectively, for a Class II half-life of 2 Myr for protostars in the Gould Belt clouds with more than 100 protostars. The mean age of these clouds is 1.2+/-0.1 Myr, and the star formation rate is (8.3+/-0.5)x10^-4 Msun/yr. The critical parameters in arriving at these numbers are the assumed half-life of the Class II stage, and the assumption that the star-formation rate and half-lives are constant. This method presents a first step in moving from steady-state to non-steady-state solutions of protostellar populations.},

  abstract    = {Intermediate-mass (IM) protostars provide a bridge between the low- and high-mass protostars. Despite their relevance, little is known about their chemical diversity. We want to investigate the molecular richness towards the envelope of IM protostars and to compare their properties with other sources. We have selected the isolated IM Class 0 protostar CepE-mm to carry out an unbiased molecular survey with the IRAM 30m telescope between 72 and 350 GHz with an angular resolution lying in the range 7-34". These data were complemented with NOEMA observations of the spectral bands 85.9 - 89.6 GHz and 216.8 - 220.4 GHz at an angular resolution of 2.3 and 1.4", respectively. 30m spectra show bright emission of O- and N-bearing COMs. We identify three components in the spectral signature: an extremely broad line component associated with the outflowing gas, a narrow line component associated with the cold envelope, and a broad line component tracing the hot corino. NOEMA observations reveal CepE-mm as a binary protostellar system CepE-A and B, separated by 1.7". CepE-A dominates the core continuum emission and powers the high-velocity jet associated with HH377. Our interferometric maps show that COMs arises from a region of 0.7" size around CepE-A. Rotational temperatures were found to lie in the range 20-40 K with column densities ranging from a few 10^15 cm-2 for O-bearing species, down to a few 10^14 cm-2 for N-bearing species. Molecular abundances are similar to those measured towards other low- and intermediate-mass protostars. High-mass hot cores are significantly less abundant in methanol and N-bearing species are more abundant by 3 orders of magnitude.CepE-mm reveals itself as a binary protostellar system with a strong chemical differentiation. The brightest component of the binary is associated with a hot corino. Its properties are similar to those of low-mass hot corinos.},

The difference between $\rm RV\_{Gaia}$ and $\rm RV\_{RAVE}$ for a majority of the sample follows normal distribution with mean = 0.28 km s$^{-1}$ and $\sigma$ = 1.49 km s$^{-1}$. However, we found a very small group of stars ($\approx 0.08\\%$ of the total) for which the difference in radial velocities between the two surveys is significantly larger with an offset of $-$104.50 km s$^{-1}$ with $\sigma$ = 4.92 km s$^{-1}$. Kinematics based on $\rm RV\_{ Gaia }$ suggest that most of the group members belong to the Galactic thin disk which agrees with the group's metallicity range of $-$1.2 to $+$0.5 dex suggesting the offset in radial velocity is probably due to RAVE velocity data for this particular group.},

  abstract      = {The Sco OB2 association is the nearest OB association, extending over approximately 2000 square degrees on the sky. Only its brightest and most massive members are already known (from Hipparcos) across its entire size, while studies of its lower-mass population refer only to small portions of its extent. In this work we exploit the capabilities of Gaia DR2 measurements to search for Sco OB2 members across its entire size and down to the lowest stellar masses. We use both Gaia astrometric (proper motions and parallaxes) and photometric measurements (integrated photometry and colors) to select association members, using minimal assumptions derived mostly from the Hipparcos studies. Gaia resolves small details in both the kinematics of individual Sco OB2 subgroups and their distribution with distance from the Sun. We find a sample of $\gt$11000 high-confidence pre-main sequence members of Sco OB2, plus \~{}2740 main-sequence candidate members with a larger field-star contamination. Most stars belong to a diffuse population, which outlines clearly the shape of the association. Upper Sco is the densest region of Sco OB2, characterized by a complex spatial and kinematical structure, with no global pattern of motion. Other dense subclusters are found in Upper Centaurus-Lupus (the richest one coincident with the group near V1062 Sco found by Roser et al. 2018), and in Lower Centaurus-Crux. The clustered stars appear to be younger than the diffuse PMS population, suggesting star formation in small groups which rapidly disperse and dilute, reaching space densities lower than field stars while keeping memory of their original kinematics. No large-scale expansion is found, in agreement with previous studies. We also find that the open cluster IC 2602 has a similar dynamics to Sco OB2, and its PMS members are currently evaporating and forming a diffuse (size \~{}10 deg) halo around its double-peaked core.},

We make use of Gaia DR2 astrometry and published Gaia-ESO Survey data. We apply an unsupervised classification algorithm to determine groups of stars with common proper motions and parallaxes. We find that the association is made up of a number of small groups, with a total current mass over 2330 Msun. The three-dimensional distribution of these young stars trace the edge of the gas and dust structure known as the IRAS Vela Shell across 180 pc and shows clear signs of expansion. We propose a common history for Vela OB2 and the IRAS Vela Shell. The event that caused the expansion of the shell happened before the Vela OB2 stars formed, imprinted the expansion in the gas the stars formed from, and most likely triggered star formation.},

We searched for H$\_2$S, CS, SO, and SO$\_2$ in the dense disk around GG Tau A with the NOrthem Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) interferometer. We detected H$\_2$S emission from the dense and cold ring orbiting around GG Tau A. This is the first detection of H$\_2$S in a protoplanetary disk. We also detected HCO$^+$, H$^{13}$CO$^+$, and DCO$^+$ in the disk. Upper limits for other molecules, CCS, SO$\_2$, SO, HC$\_3$N, and $c$-C$\_3$H$\_2$ are also obtained. The observed DCO$^+$/HCO$^+$ ratio is similar to those in other disks. The observed column densities, derived using our radiative transfer code DiskFit, are then compared with those from our chemical code Nautilus. The column densities are in reasonable agreement for DCO$^{+}$, CS, CCS, and SO$\_2$. For H$\_2$S and SO, our predicted vertical integrated column densities are more than a factor of 10 higher than the measured values. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that only a strong sulfur depletion may explain the low observed H$\_2$S column density in the disk. The H$\_2$S detection in GG Tau A is most likely linked to the much larger mass of this disk compared to that in other T Tauri systems.},

  abstract  = {About 1% of giant stars1 have anomalously high Li abundances (ALi) in their atmospheres, conflicting directly with the prediction of standard stellar evolution models2. This finding makes the production and evolution of Li in the Universe intriguing, not only in the sense of Big Bang nucleosynthesis3,4 or the interstellar medium5, but also for the evolution of stars. Decades of effort have been put into explaining why such extreme objects exist6–8, yet the origins of Li-rich giants are still being debated. Here, we report the discovery of the most Li-rich giant known to date, with a very high ALi of 4.51. This rare phenomenon was observed coincidentally with another short-term event: the star is experiencing its luminosity bump on the red giant branch. Such a high ALi indicates that the star might be at the very beginning of its Li-rich phase, which provides a great opportunity to investigate the origin and evolution of Li in the Galaxy. A detailed nuclear simulation is presented with up-to-date reaction rates to recreate the Li enrichment process in this star. Our results provide tight constraints on both observational and theoretical points of view, suggesting that low-mass giants can internally produce Li to a very high level through 7Be transportation during the red giant phase.Star TYC 429-2097-1 contains the most lithium of any giant star, but lithium is too fragile to survive in the deep layers of a stellar atmosphere. How does the enrichment arise? Yan et al. rule out external sources (engulfment, accretion), favouring an internal process called ‘extra mixing’.},

Thanks to Gaia, their kinematics can be investigated with an unprecedented precision and accuracy. Aims. The distribution of open clusters in the 6D phase space is revisited with Gaia DR2. Methods. The weighted mean radial velocity of open clusters was determined, using the most probable members available from a previous astrometric investigation that also provided mean parallaxes and proper motions. Those parameters, all derived from Gaia DR2 only, were combined to provide the 6D phase space information of 861 clusters. The velocity distribution of nearby clusters was investigated, as well as the spatial and velocity distributions of the whole sample as a function of age. A high quality subsample was used to investigate some possible pairs and groups of clusters sharing the same Galactic position and velocity. Results. For the high quality sample that has 406 clusters, the median uncertainty of the weighted mean radial velocity is 0.5 km/s. The accuracy, assessed by comparison to ground-based high resolution spectroscopy, is better than 1 km/s. Open clusters nicely follow the velocity distribution of field stars in the close Solar neighbourhood previously revealed by Gaia DR2. As expected, the vertical distribution of young clusters is very flat but the novelty is the high precision to which this can be seen. The dispersion of vertical velocities of young clusters is at the level of 5 km/s. Clusters older than 1 Gyr span distances to the Galactic plane up to 1 kpc with a vertical velocity dispersion of 14 km/s, typical of the thin disc. Five pairs of clusters and one group with five members are possibly physically related. Other binary candidates previously identified turn out to be chance alignment.},

  abstract      = {Observations of prestellar cores in star-forming filaments show two distinct morphologies. While molecular line measurements often show broad cores, submillimeter continuum observations predominantly display pinched cores compared to the bulk of the filament gas. In order to explain how different morphologies arise, we use the gravitational instability model where prestellar cores form by growing density perturbations. The radial extent at each position is set by the local line-mass. We show that the ratio of core radius to filament radius is determined by the initial line-mass of the filament. Additionally, the core morphology is independent of perturbation length scale and inclination, which makes it an ideal diagnostic for observations. Filaments with a line-mass of less than half its critical value should form broad cores, whereas filaments with more than half its critical line-mass value should form pinched cores. For filaments embedded in a constant background pressure, the dominant perturbation growth times significantly differ for low and high line-mass filaments. Therefore, we predict that only one population of cores is present if all filaments within a region begin with similar initial perturbations.},

The 1.3 mm continuum emission shows a remarkable elongated morphology along PA=31.2$\{$$\backslash$deg$\}$+/-0.1$\{$$\backslash$deg$\}$ that has a constant brightness out to a radius of r=75 au. The emission is marginally resolved in the transverse direction, implying an intrinsic vertical width $\leq$24 au and an inclination to the line-of-sight i$\geq$84.8$\{$$\backslash$deg$\}$. The monopolar outflow, detected in $^{12}$CO, arises from the north-eastern face of the disk from a disk radius r$\leq$22 au and extends up to 5'' (or 700 au) above the disk plane. We derive a lower limit to the total mass of the CO cavity/outflow of 1.7E-5 M$\_\odot$. The CO cavity morphology is that of a hollow cone with semi-opening angle \~{}35$\{$$\backslash$deg$\}$. The derived kinematics are consistent with gas flowing along the conical surface with a constant velocity of 9.3+/-0.7 km/s. We detect small rotation signatures (Vphi x sin(i) $\in$ [0.1;0.5] km/s) in the same sense as the underlying circumstellar disk. From these rotation signatures we infer an average specific angular momentum of the outflow of 38+/-15 au km/s at altitudes z$\lt$250 au. We also report the detection of small amplitude wiggling (1.2$\{$$\backslash$deg$\}$) of the CO axis around an average inclination to the line of sight of i=91$\{$$\backslash$deg$\}$. The derived morphology and kinematics of the CO cavity are compatible with expectations from a slow disk wind, originating either through photo-evaporation or magneto-centrifugal processes.},

  abstract      = {We utilize the more than 100 gravitationally-bound dense cores formed in our three-dimensional, turbulent MHD simulations reported in Chen {\amp} Ostriker (2015) to analyze structural, kinematic, and magnetic properties of prestellar cores. Our statistical results disagree with the classical theory of star formation, in which cores evolve to be oblate with magnetic field parallel to the minor axes. Instead, we find that cores are generally triaxial, although the core-scale magnetic field is still preferentially most parallel to the core's minor axis and most perpendicular to the major axis. The internal and external magnetic field directions are correlated, but the direction of integrated core angular momentum is misaligned with the core's magnetic field, consistent with recent observations. The ratio of rotational/total kinetic and rotational/gravitational energies are independent of core size and consistent in magnitude with observations. The specific angular momentum also follows the observed relationship $L/M \propto R^{3/2}$, indicating rotation is acquired from ambient turbulence. With typical $E\_\mathrm{rot}/E\_K \sim 0.1$, rotation is not the dominant motion when cores collapse.},

  abstract      = {The Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope has provided evidence for diffuse gamma-ray emission in the central parts of the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy. This excess has been interpreted either as dark matter annihilation emission or as emission from thousands of millisecond pulsars (MSPs). We have recently shown that old massive globular clusters may move towards the center of the Galaxy by dynamical friction and carry within them enough MSPs to account for the observed gamma-ray excess. In this paper we revisit the MSP scenario for the Andromeda galaxy, by modeling the formation and disruption of its globular cluster system. We find that our model predicts gamma-ray emission $\sim 2-3$ times larger than for the Milky Way, but still nearly an order of magnitude smaller than the observed Fermi excess in the Andromeda. Our MSP model can reproduce the observed excess only by assuming $\sim 8$ times larger number of old clusters than inferred from galaxy scaling relations. To explain the observations we require either that Andromeda deviates significantly from the scaling relations, or that a large part of its high-energy emission comes from additional sources.},

Treating the stars as 'sink particles', we track their birth angular momentum, and the later evolution of their angular momentum due to gas accretion. We find that in both clouds, the sinks have spin vectors that are aligned with one another, and with the global angular momentum vector of the star cluster. This alignment is present at birth, but enhanced by later gas accretion. In the compressive cloud, the sink-spins remain aligned with the gas for at least a free fall time. By contrast, in the shear cloud, the increased turbulent mixing causes the sinks to rapidly misalign with their birth cloud on approximately a gas free-fall time. In spite of this, both clouds show a strong alignment of sink-spins at the end of our simulations, independently of environment.},

We show that, with suitable corrections for projection factors, molecular line observations of velocity gradients in NH$\_3$ can be used to provide reasonable estimates of core angular momenta within a factor of two to three, with a few large underestimates due to unfavorable viewing angles. Our results differ from previous investigations which suggested that observations might overestimate true angular momenta by as much as an order of magnitude; the difference is probably due to the much smoother velocity field on small scales in our simulations, which result from allowing turbulence to decay and gravitational infall to dominate. The results emphasize the importance of understanding the nature of 'turbulent' velocities, with implications for the formation of protostellar disks during core collapse.},

  abstract      = {The merger of two neutron stars is predicted to give rise to three major detectable phenomena: a short burst of {$\gamma$}-rays, a gravitational-wave signal, and a transient optical-near-infrared source powered by the synthesis of large amounts of very heavy elements via rapid neutron capture (the r-process). Such transients, named {\lsquo}macronovae{\rsquo} or {\lsquo}kilonovae{\rsquo}, are believed to be centres of production of rare elements such as gold and platinum. The most compelling evidence so far for a kilonova was a very faint near-infrared rebrightening in the afterglow of a short {$\gamma$}-ray burst at redshift z{\thinsp}={\thinsp}0.356, although findings indicating bluer events have been reported. Here we report the spectral identification and describe the physical properties of a bright kilonova associated with the gravitational-wave source GW170817 and {$\gamma$}-ray burst GRB 170817A associated with a galaxy at a distance of 40 megaparsecs from Earth. Using a series of spectra from ground-based observatories covering the wavelength range from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared, we find that the kilonova is characterized by rapidly expanding ejecta with spectral features similar to those predicted by current models. The ejecta is optically thick early on, with a velocity of about 0.2 times light speed, and reaches a radius of about 50 astronomical units in only 1.5 days. As the ejecta expands, broad absorption-like lines appear on the spectral continuum, indicating atomic species produced by nucleosynthesis that occurs in the post-merger fast-moving dynamical ejecta and in two slower (0.05 times light speed) wind regions. Comparison with spectral models suggests that the merger ejected 0.03 to 0.05 solar masses of material, including high-opacity lanthanides.},

Our analysis of the lightcurves and indicates that the brown dwarf is likely to have an effective temperature of 1300 K, which is not consistent with the effective temperature of 800 K suggested by its mass and radius. As the brown dwarf is already absorbing almost all the white dwarf emission in the $K\_s$ band we suggest that this inconsistency may be due to the UV-irradiation from the white dwarf inducing an artificial brightening in the $K\_s$ band, similar to that seen for the similar system WD0137-349B, suggesting this brightening may be characteristic of these UV-irradiated binaries.},

  abstract      = {(Abridged) Stars more massive than $20-30M\_{\odot}$ are so luminous that the radiation force on the cooler, more opaque outer layers can balance or exceed the force of gravity. These near or super-Eddington outer envelopes represent a long standing challenge for calculating the evolution of massive stars in one dimension, a situation that limits our understanding of the stellar progenitors of some of the most exciting and energetic explosions in the universe. In particular, the proximity to the Eddington limit has been the suspected cause for the variability, large mass loss rate and giant eruptions of an enigmatic class of massive stars: the luminous blue variables (LBVs). When in quiescence, LBVs are usually found on the hot ($T\_{eff} \approx 2 - 4 \times 10^4$ K) S Dor instability strip. While in outburst, most LBVs stay on the cold S Dor instability strip with a $T\_{eff} \approx 9000$ K. Here we show that physically realistic three dimensional global radiation hydrodynamic simulations of radiation dominated massive stars with the largest supercomputers in the world naturally reproduce many observed properties of LBVs, specifically their location in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram and their episodic mass loss with rates of $10^{-7}-10^{-5} M\_{\odot}/yr$. The helium opacity peak is found to play an important role to determine these properties, which is not realized in the traditional one dimensional models of massive stars. The simulations also predict that convection causes irregular envelope oscillations and 10-30\% brightness variations on a typical timescale of a few days. The variability is more prominent in our models that are on the cool part of the S Dor instability. These calculations pave the way to a quantitative understanding of the structure, stability and the dominant mode of mass loss of massive stars.},

  abstract      = {We examine the effects that planetary encounters have on the moon systems of ejected gas giant planets. We conduct a suite of numerical simulations of planetary systems containing three Jupiter-mass planets (with the innermost planet at 3 AU) up to the point where a planet is ejected from the system. The ejected planet has an initial system of 100 test-particle moons. We determine the survival probability of moons at different distances from their host planet, measure the final distribution of orbital elements, examine the stability of resonant configurations, and characterize the properties of moons that are stripped from the planets. We find that moons are likely to survive in orbits with semi-major axes out beyond 200 planetary radii (0.1 AU in our case). The orbital inclinations and eccentricities of the surviving moons are broadly distributed and include nearly hyperbolic orbits and retrograde orbits. We find that a large fraction of moons in two-body and three-body mean-motion resonances also survive planetary ejection with the resonance intact. The moon-planet interactions, especially in the presence of mean-motion resonance, can keep the interior of the moons molten for billions of years via tidal flexing, as is seen in the moons of the gas giant planets in the solar system. Given the possibility that life may exist in the subsurface ocean of the Galilean satellite Europa, these results have implications for life on the moons of rogue planets---planets that drift through the galaxy with no host star.},

However, there is a relatively low percentage of these stars with activity cycles detected. It is well known that the cores of Ca II H{\amp}K lines are modulated by stellar activity. The behaviour of Balmer and other optical lines with stellar activity is not yet completely understood. Aims. To search for Ca II H{\amp}K, Balmer and Fe II line variations modulated by the stellar activity. In particular, we apply a novel strategy to detect possible shape variations in the H$\{$$\backslash$alpha$\}$ line. Methods. We analyse activity signatures in HD 38858 by using HARPS and CASLEO spectra obtained between 2003 and 2017. We calculate the Mount Wilson index (S$\_{MW}$), log($\mathrm{R}'\_\mathrm{HK}$) and the statistical moments of Ca II H{\amp}K, Balmer and other optical lines. We search for periodicities by using the generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram. Results. We detect a long-term activity cycle of 10.8 yr in Ca II H{\amp}K and H$\{$$\backslash$alpha$\}$, being HD 38858 one of the most similar stars to the Sun for which a cycle has been detected. In contrast, this cycle is marginally detected in the Fe II lines. Also, we detect a noticeable radial velocity variation, which seems to be produced by stellar activity. Conclusions. HD 38858 is the second solar-analogue star where we find a clear activity cycle which is replicated by Balmer lines. Spectral indexes based on the shape of H$\{$$\backslash$alpha$\}$ seems to be more realiable than the fluxes in the same line to detect activity variations. On the other hand, the cyclic modulation detected gives place to a radial velocity variation, previously associated to a super-Earth planet. Finally, due to the similarity of HD 38858 with the Sun, we recommend to continue monitoring this star.},

However, in a significant number of numerical simulations, the shock stalls and the star cannot be exploded successfully, especially for a massive, compact star. We consider an alternative scenario that with mass fallback, the collapsing star forms a black hole in the center, surrounded by a dense, hot accretion disk, which blows out an intense outflow (wind). The kinetic energy of the wind may result in a successful stellar explosion. With an improved version of the formulism in Kohri et al. (2005) who studied neutron star accretion of minor fallback, we study this disk wind-driven explosion by calculating the accretion history for a suite of pre-SN stellar models with different initial surface rotational velocities, masses and metallicities, and by comparing the disk wind energy with the binding energy of the infalling stellar envelope. We show that the most promising models to be exploded successfully by this new channel are those relatively compact pre-SN stars with relatively low metallicities and not too low specific angular momenta. The total energies of the explosions are $\sim 10^{51-52}$ergs, and a more massive progenitor may produce a more energetic explosion.},

  abstract      = {Stars lose a significant amount of angular momentum between birth and death, implying that efficient processes transporting it from the core to the surface are active. Space asteroseismology delivered the interior rotation rates of more than a thousand low- and intermediate-mass stars, revealing that: 1) single stars rotate nearly uniformly during the core hydrogen and core helium burning phases; 2) stellar cores spin up to a factor 10 faster than the envelope during the red giant phase; 3) the angular momentum of the helium-burning core of stars is in agreement with the angular momentum of white dwarfs. Observations reveal a strong decrease of core angular momentum when stars have a convective core. Current theory of angular momentum transport fails to explain this. We propose improving the theory with a data-driven approach, whereby angular momentum prescriptions derived from multi-dimensional (magneto)hydrodynamical simulations and theoretical considerations are continously tested against modern observations. The TESS and PLATO space missions have the potential to derive the interior rotation of large samples of stars, including high-mass and metal-poor stars in binaries and clusters.
