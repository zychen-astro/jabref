  abstract      = {If dark matter is composed of massive bosons, a Bose-Einstein Condensation process must have occurred during the cosmological evolution. Therefore galactic dark matter may be in a form of a condensate, characterized by a strong self-interaction. We consider the effects of rotation on the Bose-Einstein Condensate dark matter halos, and we investigate how rotation might influence their astrophysical properties. In order to describe the condensate we use the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, and the Thomas-Fermi approximation, which predicts a polytropic equation of state with polytropic index $n=1$. By assuming a rigid body rotation for the halo, with the use of the hydrodynamic representation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation we obtain the basic equation describing the density distribution of the rotating condensate. We obtain the general solutions for the condensed dark matter density, and we derive the general representations for the mass distribution, boundary (radius), potential energy, velocity dispersion, tangential velocity and for the logarithmic density and velocity slopes, respectively. Explicit expressions for the radius, mass, and tangential velocity are obtained in the first order of approximation, under the assumption of slow rotation. In order to compare our results with the observations we fit the theoretical expressions of the tangential velocity of massive test particles moving in rotating Bose-Einstein Condensate dark halos with the data of 12 dwarf galaxies, and the Milky Way, respectively.},

  abstract      = {As it was pointed out recently in Hees et al. (2017), observations of stars near the Galactic Center with current and future facilities provide an unique tool to test general relativity (GR) and alternative theories of gravity in a strong gravitational field regime. In particular, the authors showed that the Yukawa gravity could be constrained with Keck and TMT observations. Some time ago, Dadhich et al. (2001) showed that the Reissner -- Nordstr$\backslash$``om metric with a tidal charge is naturally appeared in the framework of Randall -- Sundrum model with an extra dimension ($Q^2$ is called tidal charge and it could be negative in such an approach). Possible observational signatures of gravitational lensing in a presence of the Reissner -- Nordstr$\backslash$''om black hole with a tidal charge at the Galactic Center are discussed in papers by Bin-Nun (2010a, 2010b, 2011). Here we are following such an approach and we obtain analytical expressions for orbital precession for Reissner -- Nordstrom -- de-Sitter solution in post-Newtonian approximation and discuss opportunities to constrain parameters of the metric from observations of bright stars with current and future astrometric observational facilities such as VLT, Keck, GRAVITY, E-ELT and TMT.},

  abstract      = {The observed value $\Lambda\_{\rm obs}$ of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is extremely smaller than theoretical expectations, and the anthropic argument has been proposed as a solution to this problem because galaxies do not form when $\Lambda \gg \Lambda\_{\rm obs}$. However, the contemporary galaxy formation theory predicts that stars form even with a high value of $\Lambda / \Lambda\_{\rm obs} \sim$ 50, which makes the anthropic argument less persuasive. Here we calculate the probability distribution of $\Lambda$ using a model of cosmological galaxy formation, considering extinction of observers caused by radiation from nearby supernovae. The life survival probability decreases in a large $\Lambda$ universe because of higher stellar density. Using a reasonable rate of lethal supernovae, we find that the mean expectation value of $\Lambda$ can be close to $\Lambda\_{\rm obs}$, and hence this effect may be essential to understand the small but nonzero value of $\Lambda$. It is predicted that we are located on the edge of habitable regions about stellar density, which may be tested in future exoplanet studies.},

We combine these SNe Ia with a new compilation of {\sim}1050 SNe Ia, jointly calibrated and corrected for simulated survey biases to produce accurate distance measurements. We present unbiased constraints on the expansion rate at six redshifts in the range 0.07$\lt$ z$\lt$ 1.5 based only on this combined SN Ia sample. The added leverage of our new sample at z$\gt$ 1.5 leads to a factor of {\sim}3 improvement in the determination of the expansion rate at z = 1.5, reducing its uncertainty to {\sim}20\%, a measurement of H(z=1.5)/$\{$H$\}$$_{0}$ = $\{$2.69$\}$$_{-0.52}$$^{+0.86}$. We then demonstrate that these six derived expansion rate measurements alone provide a nearly identical characterization of dark energy as the full SN sample, making them an efficient compression of the SN Ia data. The new sample of SNe Ia at z$\gt$ 1.5 usefully distinguishes between alternative cosmological models and unmodeled evolution of the SN Ia distance indicators, placing empirical limits on the latter. Finally, employing a realistic simulation of a potential Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope SN survey observing strategy, we forecast optimistic future constraints on the expansion rate from SNe Ia.},

  abstract      = {We propose a new mechanism by which dark matter (DM) can affect the early universe. The hot interior of a macroscopic DM, or macro, can behave as a heat reservoir so that energetic photons are emitted from its surface. This results in spectral distortions (SDs) of the cosmic microwave background. The SDs depend on the density and the cooling processes of the interior, and the surface composition of the Macros. We use neutron stars as a model for nuclear-density Macros and find that the spectral distortions are mass-independent for fixed density. In our work, we find that, for Macros of this type that constitute 100$\\%$ of the dark matter, the $\mu$ and $y$ distortions can be above detection threshold for typical proposed next-generation experiments such as PIXIE.},

  abstract = {The existence of a {\lsquo}density cusp{\rsquo}{\mdash}a localized increase in number{\mdash}of stellar-mass black holes near a supermassive black hole is a fundamental prediction of galactic stellar dynamics. The best place to detect such a cusp is in the Galactic Centre, where the nearest supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*, resides. As many as 20,000 black holes are predicted to settle into the central parsec of the Galaxy as a result of dynamical friction; however, so far no density cusp of black holes has been detected. Low-mass X-ray binary systems that contain a stellar-mass black hole are natural tracers of isolated black holes. Here we report observations of a dozen quiescent X-ray binaries in a density cusp within one parsec of Sagittarius A*. The lower-energy emission spectra that we observed in these binaries is distinct from the higher-energy spectra associated with the population of accreting white dwarfs that dominates the central eight parsecs of the Galaxy. The properties of these X-ray binaries, in particular their spatial distribution and luminosity function, suggest the existence of hundreds of binary systems in the central parsec of the Galaxy and many more isolated black holes. We cannot rule out a contribution to the observed emission from a population (of up to about one-half the number of X-ray binaries) of rotationally powered, millisecond pulsars. The spatial distribution of the binary systems is a relic of their formation history, either in the stellar disk around Sagittarius A* (ref. 7) or through in-fall from globular clusters, and constrains the number density of sources in the modelling of gravitational waves from massive stellar remnants, such as neutron stars and black holes.},

  month         = apr,
  abstract      = {The processes driving gas accretion on to supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are still poorly understood. Angular momentum conservation prevents gas within $\sim10\,$pc of the black hole from reaching radii $\sim10^{-3}\,$pc where viscous accretion becomes efficient. Here we present simulations of the collapse of a clumpy shell of swept-up isothermal gas, which is assumed to have formed as a result of feedback from a previous episode of AGN activity. The gas falls towards the SMBH forming clumps and streams, which intersect, collide, and often form a disc. These collisions promote partial cancellations of angular momenta, resulting in further infall and more collisions. This continued collisional cascade generates a tail of gas with sufficiently small angular momenta and provides a viable route for gas inflow to sub-parsec scales. The efficiency of this process hardly depends on details, such as gas temperature, initial virial ratio and power spectrum of the gas distribution, as long as it is not strongly rotating. Adding star formation to this picture might explain the near-simultaneous formation of the S-stars (from tidally disrupted binaries formed in plunging gas streams) and the sub-parsec young stellar disc around Sgr A$^{\!\star}$.},

  abstract      = {Nearly every massive galaxy harbors a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in its nucleus. SMBH masses are millions to billions $M\_{\odot}$, and they correlate with properties of spheroids of their host galaxies. While the SMBH growth channels, mergers and gas accretion, are well established, their origin remains uncertain: they could have either emerged from massive ``seeds'' ($10^5-10^6 M\_{\odot}$) formed by direct collapse of gas clouds in the early Universe or from smaller ($100 M\_{\odot}$) black holes, end-products of first stars. The latter channel would leave behind numerous intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs, $10^2-10^5 M\_{\odot}$). Although many IMBH candidates have been identified, none is accepted as definitive, thus their very existence is still debated. Using data mining in wide-field sky surveys and applying dedicated analysis to archival and follow-up optical spectra, we identified a sample of 305 IMBH candidates having masses $3\times10^4\ltM\_{\mathrm{BH}}\lt2\times10^5 M\_{\odot}$, which reside in galaxy centers and are accreting gas that creates characteristic signatures of a type-I active galactic nucleus (AGN). We confirmed the AGN nature of ten sources (including five previously known objects which validate our method) by detecting the X-ray emission from their accretion discs, thus defining the first bona fide sample of IMBHs in galactic nuclei. All IMBH host galaxies possess small bulges and sit on the low-mass extension of the $M\_{\mathrm{BH}}-M\_{\mathrm{bulge}}$ scaling relation suggesting that they must have experienced very few if any major mergers over their lifetime. The very existence of nuclear IMBHs supports the stellar mass seed scenario of the massive black hole formation.},

Once if this parameter achieves an oscillatory feature for a while during inflation, a significant non-perturbative resonance effect on the inflaton field fluctuations takes place around a critical length scale, which results in significant peaks in the primordial power spectrum. By virtue of this robust mechanism, primordial black holes with specific mass function can be produced with a sufficient abundance for dark matter in sizable parameter ranges.},

  abstract      = {On 17 August 2017, the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors observed the gravitational-wave event GW170817{\mdash}a strong signal from the merger of a binary neutron-star system. Less than two seconds after the merger, a {$\gamma$}-ray burst (GRB 170817A) was detected within a region of the sky consistent with the LIGO-Virgo-derived location of the gravitational-wave source. This sky region was subsequently observed by optical astronomy facilities, resulting in the identification of an optical transient signal within about ten arcseconds of the galaxy NGC 4993. This detection of GW170817 in both gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves represents the first {\lsquo}multi-messenger{\rsquo} astronomical observation. Such observations enable GW170817 to be used as a {\lsquo}standard siren{\rsquo} (meaning that the absolute distance to the source can be determined directly from the gravitational-wave measurements) to measure the Hubble constant. This quantity represents the local expansion rate of the Universe, sets the overall scale of the Universe and is of fundamental importance to cosmology. Here we report a measurement of the Hubble constant that combines the distance to the source inferred purely from the gravitational-wave signal with the recession velocity inferred from measurements of the redshift using the electromagnetic data. In contrast to previous measurements, ours does not require the use of a cosmic {\lsquo}distance ladder{\rsquo}: the gravitational-wave analysis can be used to estimate the luminosity distance out to cosmological scales directly, without the use of intermediate astronomical distance measurements. We determine the Hubble constant to be about 70 kilometres per second per megaparsec. This value is consistent with existing measurements, while being completely independent of them. Additional standard siren measurements from future gravitational-wave sources will enable the Hubble constant to be constrained to high precision.},

  abstract      = {The last century has seen enormous progress in our understanding of the Universe. We know the life cycles of stars, the structure of galaxies, the remnants of the big bang, and have a general understanding of how the Universe evolved. We have come remarkably far using electromagnetic radiation as our tool for observing the Universe. However, gravity is the engine behind many of the processes in the Universe, and much of its action is dark. Opening a gravitational window on the Universe will let us go further than any alternative. Gravity has its own messenger: Gravitational waves, ripples in the fabric of spacetime. They travel essentially undisturbed and let us peer deep into the formation of the first seed black holes, exploring redshifts as large as z \~{} 20, prior to the epoch of cosmic re-ionisation. Exquisite and unprecedented measurements of black hole masses and spins will make it possible to trace the history of black holes across all stages of galaxy evolution, and at the same time constrain any deviation from the Kerr metric of General Relativity. eLISA will be the first ever mission to study the entire Universe with gravitational waves. eLISA is an all-sky monitor and will offer a wide view of a dynamic cosmos using gravitational waves as new and unique messengers to unveil The Gravitational Universe. It provides the closest ever view of the early processes at TeV energies, has guaranteed sources in the form of verification binaries in the Milky Way, and can probe the entire Universe, from its smallest scales around singularities and black holes, all the way to cosmological dimensions.},

  abstract = {We construct dynamical models for a sample of 36 nearby galaxies with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry and ground-based kinematics. The models assume that each galaxy is axisymmetric, with a two-integral distribution function, arbitrary inclination angle, a position-independent stellar mass-to-light ratio Upsilon, and a central massive dark object (MDO) of arbitrary mass M\_{\bull}. They provide acceptable fits to 32 of the galaxies for some value of M\_{\bull} and Upsilon the four galaxies that cannot be fitted have kinematically decoupled cores. The mass-to-light ratios inferred for the 32 well-fitted galaxies are consistent with the fundamental-plane correlation Upsilon \~{} L\^{}0.2, where L is galaxy luminosity. In all but six galaxies the models require at the 95\% confidence level an MDO of mass M\_{\bull} \~{} 0.006M\_bulge = 0.006UpsilonL. Five of the six galaxies consistent with M\_{\bull} = 0 are also consistent with this correlation. The other (NGC 7332) has a much stronger upper limit on M\_{\bull}. We predict the second-moment profiles that should be observed at HST resolution for the 32 galaxies that our models describe well. We consider various parameterizations for the probability distribution describing the correlation of the masses of these MDOs with other galaxy properties. One of the best models can be summarized thus: a fraction f \~{}= 0.97 of early-type galaxies have MDOs, whose masses are well described by a Gaussian distribution in log (M\_{\bull}/M\_bulge) of mean -2.28 and standard deviation \~{}0.51. There is also marginal evidence that M\_{\bull} is distributed differently for ``core'' and ``power law'' galaxies, with core galaxies having a somewhat steeper dependence on M\_bulge.},

  abstract    = {We investigate the alignment of haloes with the filaments of the cosmic web using an unprecedently large sample of dark matter haloes taken from the P-Millennium $\Lambda$CDM cosmological N-body simulation. We use the state-of-the-art NEXUS multiscale morphological formalism which identifies simultaneously structures at all scales. We find strong and highly significant alignments, with both the major axis of haloes and their peculiar velocity tending to orient along the filament. However, the spin - filament alignment displays a puzzling trend changing from preferentially parallel at low masses to preferentially perpendicular at high masses, in stark contrast with the predictions of tidal torque theory. This "spin flip" occurs at a mass of $5\times10^{11}~h^{-1}M_\odot$. This mass increases with increasing filament diameter, varying by more than an order of magnitude between the thinnest and thickest filament samples. We also find that the inner parts of haloes have a spin flip mass that is several times smaller than that of the halo as a whole. These results suggest that recent accretion is responsible for the complex behaviour of the halo spin - filament alignment. Low-mass haloes mainly accrete mass along directions perpendicular to their host filament and thus their spins tend to be oriented along the filaments. In contrast, high-mass haloes mainly accrete along their host filaments and have their spins preferentially perpendicular to them. Furthermore, haloes located in thinner filaments are more likely to accrete along their host filaments than same mass haloes embedded in thicker filaments.},

  abstract    = {The formation of stellar mass black holes from the remnants of Population III stars provides a source of initial black hole seeds with the potential to grow into intermediate or, in rare cases, possibly supermassive black holes. We use the Renaissance simulation suite to follow the growth of over 15,000 black holes born into mini-haloes in the early Universe. The black holes populate haloes from 10^6 Msun up to 10^9 Msun. We find that all of the black holes display very inefficient growth. On average the black holes increase their initial mass by a factor 10^-5, with the most active black holes increasing their mass by approximately 10%. Only a single black hole experiences any period of super-Eddington accretion, but the duration is very short and not repeated. Furthermore, we find no correlation of black hole accretion with halo mass in the mass range sampled. Within most haloes, we identify clumps of cool, dense gas for which accretion rates would be high, but instances of black holes encountering these clumps are rare and short-lived. Star formation competes with black hole growth by consuming available gas and driving down accretion rates through feedback. We conclude that the black holes born from Population III remnants do not form a significant population of intermediate mass black holes in the early Universe and will need to wait until later times to undergo significant accretion, if at all.},

  title       = {Gravitational wave sources from inspiralling globular clusters in the Galactic Centre and similar environments},
  abstract    = {We model the inspiral of globular clusters (GCs) towards a galactic nucleus harboring a supermassive black hole (SMBH), a leading scenario for the formation of nuclear star clusters. We consider the case of GCs containing either an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) or a population of stellar mass black holes (BHs), and study the formation of gravitational wave (GW) sources. We perform direct summation $N$-body simulations of the infall of GCs with different orbital eccentricities in the live background of a galaxy with either a shallow or steep density profile. We find that the GC acts as an efficient carrier for the IMBH, facilitating the formation of a bound pair. The hardening and evolution of the binary depends sensitively on the galaxy's density profile. If the host galaxy has a shallow profile the hardening is too slow to allow for coalescence within a Hubble time, unless the initial cluster orbit is highly eccentric. If the galaxy hosts a nuclear star cluster, the hardening leads to coalescence by emission of GWs within $3-4$ Gyr. In this case, we find a IMBH-SMBH merger rate of $\Gamma_{\rm IMBH-SMBH} = 2.8\times 10^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$. If the GC hosts a population of stellar BHs, these are deposited close enough to the SMBH to form extreme-mass-ratio-inspirals with a merger rate of $\Gamma_{\rm EMRI} = 0.25$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$. Finally, the SMBH tidal field can boost the coalescence of stellar black hole binaries delivered from the infalling GCs. The merger rate for this merging channel is $\Gamma_{\rm BHB} = 0.4-4$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$.},

  title       = {Time evolution of intrinsic alignments of galaxies},
  abstract    = {Intrinsic alignments (IA), correlations between the intrinsic shapes and orientations of galaxies on the sky, are both a significant systematic in weak lensing and a probe of the effect of large-scale structure on galactic structure and angular momentum. In the era of precision cosmology, it is thus especially important to model IA with high accuracy. Efforts to use cosmological perturbation theory to model the dependence of IA on the large-scale structure have thus far been relatively successful; however, extant models do not consistently account for time evolution. In particular, advection of galaxies due to peculiar velocities alters the impact of IA, because galaxy positions when observed are generally different from their positions at the epoch when IA is believed to be set. In this work, we evolve the galaxy IA from the time of galaxy formation to the time at which they are observed, including the effects of this advection, and show how this process naturally leads to a dependence of IA on the velocity shear. We calculate the galaxy-galaxy-IA bispectrum to tree level (in the linear matter density) in terms of the evolved IA coefficients. We then discuss the implications for weak lensing systematics as well as for studies of galaxy formation and evolution. We find that considering advection introduces nonlocality into the bispectrum, and that the degree of nonlocality represents the memory of a galaxy's path from the time of its formation to the time of observation. We discuss how this result can be used to constrain the redshift at which IA is determined and provide Fisher estimation for the relevant measurements using the example of SDSS-BOSS.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we derive a novel circular velocity relation for a test particle in a 3D gravitational potential applicable to every system of curvilinear coordinates, suitable to be reduced to orthogonal form. As an illustration of the potentiality of the determined circular velocity expression we perform the rotation curves analysis of UGC 8490 and UGC 9753 and we estimate the total and dark matter mass of these two galaxies under the assumption that their respective dark matter halos have spherical, prolate and oblate spheroidal mass distributions. We employ stellar population synthesis models and the total HI density map to obtain the stellar and HI+He+metals rotation curves of both galaxies. The subtraction of the stellar plus gas rotation curves from the observed rotation curves of UGC 8490 and UGC 9753 generates the dark matter circular velocity curves of both galaxies. We fit the dark matter rotation curves of UGC 8490 and UGC 9753 through the newly established circular velocity formula specialised to the spherical, prolate and oblate spheroidal mass distributions, considering the Navarro, Frenk and White, Burkert, Di Cintio, Einasto and Stadel dark matter halos. Our principal findings are the following: globally, cored dark matter profiles Burkert and Einasto prevail over cuspy Navarro, Frenk and White and Di Cintio. Also, spherical/oblate dark matter models fit better the dark matter rotation curves of both galaxies than prolate dark matter halos.},

  title       = {Two Separate Outflows in the Dual Supermassive Black Hole System NGC 6240},
  abstract    = {Theoretical models and numerical simulations have established a framework of galaxy evolution in which galaxies merge and create dual supermassive black holes (with separations of one to ten kiloparsecs), which eventually sink into the centre of the merger remnant, emit gravitational waves and coalesce. The merger also triggers star formation and supermassive black hole growth, and gas outflows regulate the stellar content. Although this theoretical picture is supported by recent observations of starburst-driven and supermassive black hole-driven outflows, it remains unclear how these outflows interact with the interstellar medium. Furthermore, the relative contributions of star formation and black hole activity to galactic feedback remain unknown. Here we report observations of dual outflows in the central region of the prototypical merger NGC 6240. We find a black-hole-driven outflow of [O III] to the northeast and a starburst-driven outflow of H{\alpha} to the northwest. The orientations and positions of the outflows allow us to isolate them spatially and study their properties independently. We estimate mass outflow rates of 10 and 75 solar masses per year for the H{\alpha} bubble and the [O III] cone, respectively. Their combined mass outflow is comparable to the star formation rate, suggesting that negative feedback on star formation is occurring.},

Upcoming sub-millimetre very-long-baseline-interferometry (VLBI) images of Sgr A* carried out by the Event-Horizon-Telescope Collaboration (EHTC) are expected to provide critical evidence for the existence of this supermassive BH. We assess our present ability to use EHTC images to determine if they correspond to a Kerr BH as predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity (GR) or to a BH in alternative theories of gravity. To this end, we perform general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (GRMHD) simulations and use general-relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) calculations to generate synthetic shadow images of a magnetised accretion flow onto a Kerr BH. In addition, and for the first time, we perform GRMHD simulations and GRRT calculations for a dilaton BH, which we take as a representative solution of an alternative theory of gravity. Adopting the VLBI configuration from the 2017 EHTC campaign, we find that it could be extremely difficult to distinguish between BHs from different theories of gravity, thus highlighting that great caution is needed when interpreting BH images as tests of GR.},

  title       = {The rapid growth phase of supermassive black holes},
  abstract    = {We investigate the rapid growth phase of supermassive black holes (BHs) within the hydrodynamical cosmological \eagle simulation. This non-linear phase of BH growth occurs within $\sim$$L_{*}$ galaxies, embedded between two regulatory states of the galaxy host: in sub $L_{*}$ galaxies efficient stellar feedback regulates the gas inflow onto the galaxy and significantly reduces the growth of the central BH, while in galaxies more massive than $L_{*}$ efficient AGN feedback regulates the gas inflow onto the galaxy and curbs further non-linear BH growth. We find evolving critical galaxy and halo mass scales at which rapid BH growth begins. Galaxies in the low-redshift Universe ($z \approx 0$) transition into the rapid BH growth phase in haloes that are approximately an order of magnitude more massive than their high-redshift ($z \approx 6$) counterparts. We additionally show that major galaxy--galaxy interactions ($\mu \geq \frac{1}{4}$, where $\mu$ is the stellar mass ratio), whilst having little influence at high redshift, play a substantial role in triggering the rapid growth phase of BHs in the low-redshift Universe. Approximately 40\% of BHs that initiate the rapid BH growth phase at $z \approx 0$ do so within $\pm 0.5$ dynamical times of a major galaxy--galaxy merger, a fourfold increase above what is expected from the background merger rate. We find that minor mergers ($\frac{1}{10} \leq \mu < \frac{1}{4}$) have little influence in triggering the rapid growth phase at all epochs.},

  title       = {Three problems about multi-scale modelling in cosmology},
  abstract    = {The debate in cosmology concerning LambdaCDM and MOND depends crucially on their respective ability of modelling across scales, and dealing with some of the specific problems that arise along the way. The main upshot of this article is to present three main problems facing multi-scale modelling in contemporary cosmology. The LambdaCDM model, which is the standard and by far most successful current cosmological model, faces what I call the downscaling problem when it comes to explain some recalcitrant evidence at the scale of individual galaxies, such as the mass-discrepancy acceleration relation (MDAR) and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTF). While the fastgrowing development of computer simulations has addressed these problems, nagging worries remain about some of the epistemic limits of these computer simulations in retrieving (as opposed to explaining) the data. The so-called upscaling problem affects MOND and its ability not just to explain but even simply retrieve large-scale structure and galaxy clusters. Recent attempts at extending MOND (EMOND) have had a limited empirical success, and are still far from providing a consistent explanation for possible formation mechanisms at the large-scale structure. Finally, the in between scales problem affects proposals designed to achieve the best of both worlds at the meso-scale. This is a fascinating area from a physical and a philosophical point of view, where the main challenge is the ability to have genuine predictive novelty.},

  abstract    = {Irrespective of the dark matter (DM) candidate, several potentially observable signatures derive from the velocity distribution of DM in halos, in particular in the Milky Way (MW) halo. Examples include direct searches for weakly-interacting massive particles (WIMPs), $p$-wave suppressed or Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilation signals, microlensing events of primordial black holes (PBHs), {\em etc}. Most current predictions are based on the Maxwellian approximation which is not only theoretically inconsistent in bounded systems, but also not supported by cosmological simulations. A more consistent method sometimes used in calculations for direct WIMP searches relies on the so-called Eddington inversion method, which relates the DM phase-space distribution function (DF) to its mass density profile and the total gravitational potential of the system. Originally built upon the isotropy assumption, this method can be extended to anisotropic systems. We investigate these inversion methods in the context of Galactic DM searches, motivated by the fact that the MW is a strongly constrained system, and should be even more so with the ongoing Gaia survey. We still draw conclusions that apply to the general case. In particular, we illustrate how neglecting the radial boundary of the DM halo leads to theoretical inconsistencies. We also show that several realistic configurations of the DM halo and the MW baryonic content entail ill-defined DFs, significantly restricting the configuration space over which these inversion methods can apply. We propose consistent solutions to these issues. Finally, we compute several observables inferred from constrained Galactic mass models relevant to DM searches (WIMPs or PBHs), {\em e.g.} moments and inverse moments of the DM speed and relative speed distributions.},

  abstract    = {Context. Astrometric microlensing is an excellent tool to determine the mass of a stellar object. By measuring the astrometric shift of a background source star in combination with precise predictions of its unlensed position and of the lens position, gravitational lensing allows to determine the mass of the lensing star with a precision of 1 percent, independent of any prior knowledge. Aims. Making use of the recently published Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia DR2) we predict astrometric microlensing events by foreground stars of high proper motion passing by a background star in the coming years. Methods. We compile a list of ~148.000 high-proper-motion stars within Gaia DR2 with $\mu_{tot}$ > 150 mas/yr. We then search for background stars close to their paths and calculate the dates and separations of the closest approaches. Using color and absolute magnitude, we determine approximate masses of the lenses. Finally, we calculate the expected astrometric shifts and magnifications of the predicted events. Results . We detect two ongoing microlensing events by the high proper motion stars Luyten 143-23 and Ross 322 and predict closest separations of (108.5 $\pm$ 1.4) mas in July 2018 and (125.3 $\pm$ 3.4) mas in August 2018, respectively. The respective expected astrometric shifts are (1.74 $\pm$ 0.12) mas and (0.76 $\pm$ 0.06) mas. Furthermore, Luyten 143-23 will pass by another star in March 2021 with a closest separation of (280.1 $\pm$ 1.1) mas, which results in an expected shift of (0.69 $\pm$ 0.05) mas.},

  abstract    = {The spectral type of Mrk 1018 changed from Type 1.9 to 1 and returned back to 1.9 over a period of 40 years. We have investigated physical mechanisms responsible for the spectral change in Mrk 1018 by analyzing archival spectral and imaging data. Two kinematically distinct broad-line components, blueshifted and redshifted components, are found from spectral decomposition. The velocity offset curve of the broad-line as a function of time shows a characteristic pattern. An oscillating recoiled supermassive black hole (rSMBH) scenario is proposed to explain the observed velocity offset in broad emission lines. A Bayesian Markov-Chain Monte Carlo simulation is performed to derive the best fit orbital parameters, we find that the rSMBH has a highly eccentric orbit with a period of $\sim$29 years. The AGN activity traced by variation of broad H$\beta$ emission line is found to increase and decrease rapidly at the start and end of the cycle, and peaked twice at the start and near the end of the cycle. Extinction at the start and end of the cycle (when its spectral type is Type 1.9) is found to increase due to increased covering factor. Perturbations of the accretion disk caused by pericentric passage can reasonably explain the AGN activity and spectral change in Mrk 1018. Currently, the spectral type of Mrk 1018 is Type 1.9, and we do not know if it will repeat a similar pattern of spectral change in the future, but if it does, then spectral type will turn to Type 1 around mid 2020's.},

  abstract    = {Gravitational waves (GWs) in the nano-hertz band are great tools for understanding the cosmological evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galactic nuclei. We consider SMBH binaries in high-$z$ ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) as sources of a stochastic GW background (GWB). ULIRGs are likely associated with gas-rich galaxy mergers containing SMBHs that possibly occur at most once in the life of galaxies, unlike multiple dry mergers at low redshift. Adopting a well-established sample of ULIRGs, we study the properties of the GWB due to coalescing binary SMBHs in these galaxies. Since the ULIRG population peaks at $z>1.5$, the amplitude of the GWB is not affected by a moderate delay by $\lesssim $ 7 Gyrs of SMBH mergers. Despite the rarity of the high-$z$ ULIRGs, we find a tension with the upper limits from Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments. This result suggests that if a fraction $f_{\rm m,gal}$ of ULIRGs are associated with SMBH binaries, then no more than $50\% ~f_{\rm m,gal}(\lambda_{\rm Edd}/0.3)^{5/3}(t_{\rm life}/30~{\rm Myr})$ of the binary SMBHs in ULIRGs can merge within a Hubble time, for plausible values of the Eddington ratio of ULIRGs ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$) and their lifetime ($t_{\rm life}$).},

For the first time, we compute the in-situ merger rate for such massive black hole remnants by combining their abundance and multiplicity estimates. For black holes with initial masses in the range $10^{4-6} \ \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ merging at redshifts $z \gtrsim 15$ our optimistic model predicts that LISA should be able to detect 0.6 mergers per year. This rate of detection can be attributed, without confusion, to the in-situ mergers of seeds from the collapse of very massive stars. Equally, in the case where LISA observes no mergers from heavy seeds at $z \gtrsim 15$ we can constrain the combined number density, multiplicity, and coalesence times of these high-redshift systems. This letter proposes gravitational wave signatures as a means to constrain theoretical models and processes that govern the abundance of massive black hole seeds in the early Universe.},

  abstract    = {We study the effects of the local environmental density and the cosmic web environment (filaments, walls, and voids) on key properties of dark matter halos using the Bolshoi-Planck LCDM cosmological simulation. The z = 0 simulation is analysed into filaments, walls, and voids using the SpineWeb method and also the VIDE package of tools, both of which use the watershed transform. The key halo properties that we study are the specific mass accretion rate, spin parameter, concentration, prolateness, scale factor of the last major merger, and scale factor when the halo had half of its z = 0 mass. For all these properties, we find that there is no discernible difference between the halo properties in filaments, walls, or voids when compared at the same environmental density. As a result, we conclude that environmental density is the core attribute that affects these properties. This conclusion is in line with recent findings that properties of galaxies in redshift surveys are independent of their cosmic web environment at the same environmental density at z ~ 0. We also find that the local web environment of the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxies near the centre of a cosmic wall does not appear to have any effect on the properties of these galaxies' dark matter halos except for their orientation, although we find that it is rather rare to have such massive halos near the centre of a relatively small cosmic wall.},

The critical temperature of condensation $T^{(\mu)}_c$ for $\mu\neq 0$ is higher than the boson $T_c$. We find other important virtues of $\mu$-thermodynamics versus usual bosons and conclude: the condensate of $\mu$-Bose gas can serve as (an effective) model of galactic-halos dark matter.},

In this paper, we address the detection of the known multiply-imaged quasars from the Gaia Data Release 2 and determine the astrometric and photometric properties of the individually detected images found in the Gaia DR2 catalogue. We have compiled an exhaustive list of quasar gravitational lenses from the literature to search for counterparts in the Gaia Data Release 2. We then analyze the astrometric and photometric properties of these Gaia's detections. To highlight the tremendous potential of Gaia at the sub-milliarcsecond level we finally perform a simple Bayesian modeling of the well-known gravitational lens system HE0435-1223, using Gaia Data Release 2 and HST astrometry. From 478 known multiply imaged quasars, 200 have at least one image found in the Gaia Data Release 2. Among the 41 known quadruply-imaged quasars of the list, 26 have at least one image in the Gaia Data Release 2, 12 of which are fully detected, 6 have three counterparts, 7 have two and 1 has only one. As expected, the modeling of HE0435-1223 shows that the model parameters are significantly better constrained when using Gaia astrometry compared to HST astrometry, in particular the relative positions of the background quasar source and the centroid of the deflector. The Gaia sub-milliarcsecond astrometry also significantly reduces the parameter correlations. Besides providing an up-to-date list of multiply imaged quasars and their detection in the Gaia DR2, this paper shows that more complex modeling scenarios will certainly benefit from Gaia sub-milliarcsecond astrometry.},

  abstract    = {The rapidly growing statistical precision of galaxy surveys has lead to a need for ever-more precise predictions of the observables used to constrain cosmological and galaxy formation models. The primary avenue through which such predictions will be obtained is suites of numerical simulations. These simulations must span the relevant model parameter spaces, be large enough to obtain the precision demanded by upcoming data, and be thoroughly validated in order to ensure accuracy. In this paper we present one such suite of simulations, forming the basis for the AEMULUS Project, a collaboration devoted to precision emulation of galaxy survey observables. We have run a set of 75 (1.05 h^-1 Gpc)^3 simulations with mass resolution and force softening of 3.51\times 10^10 (Omega_m / 0.3) ~ h^-1 M_sun and 20 ~ h^-1 kpc respectively in 47 different wCDM cosmologies spanning the range of parameter space allowed by the combination of recent Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation and Type Ia Supernovae results. We present convergence tests of several observables including spherical overdensity halo mass functions, galaxy projected correlation functions, galaxy clustering in redshift space, and matter and halo correlation functions and power spectra. We show that these statistics are converged to 1% (2%) for halos with more than 500 (200) particles respectively and scales of r>200 ~ h^-1 kpc in real space or k ~ 3 h Mpc^-1 in harmonic space for z\le 1. We find that the dominant source of uncertainty comes from varying the particle loading of the simulations. This leads to large systematic errors for statistics using halos with fewer than 200 particles and scales smaller than k ~ 4 h^-1 Mpc. We provide the halo catalogs and snapshots detailed in this work to the community at https://AemulusProject.github.io.},

  abstract    = {At cosmological distances, gravitational lensing can provide a direct measurement of supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses irrespective of their luminosities. When the background lensed and foreground lensing galaxies are well aligned, an inherent degeneracy with the mass profile of the lensing galaxy means that only constraints are possible on its SMBH mass. Here, we directly measure the mass of a SMBH in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) of MACS J1149.5+2223 at $z=0.54$ through one of the multiply-lensed images of a background spiral galaxy at $z=1.49$ projected close to the BCG. In this particular image, an intrinsically compact region in one of the spiral arms is lensed into an arc that curves towards the BCG center. Crucially, this arc has a radius of curvature of only $\sim$0."6, betraying the presence of a local compact deflector. Its curvature is most simply reproduced by a point-like object with a mass of $8.4^{+4.3}_{-1.8}\times10^{9}M_\odot$, similar to SMBH masses in local elliptical galaxies having comparable luminosities. The SMBH is noticeably offset by $4.4\pm0.3$ kpc from the BCG light centre, plausibly the result of a kick imparted $\sim2.9\times10^7$ years ago during the merger of two SMBHs, placing it just beyond the stellar core. A similar curvature can be produced by replacing the offset SMBH with a compact galaxy having a mass of $\sim2\times 10^{10}M_\odot$ within a cutoff radius of $<4$ kpc, and an unusually large $M/L>50(M/L)_\odot$ to make it undetectable in the deep Hubble Frontiers Fields image, at or close to the cluster redshift; such a lensing galaxy, however, perturbs other nearby lensed features of the spiral galaxy in an undesirable manner.},

  abstract    = {Time-delay cosmography provides a unique way to directly measure the Hubble constant ($H_{0}$). The precision of the $H_{0}$ measurement depends on the uncertainties in the time-delay measurements, the mass distribution of the main deflector(s), and the mass distribution along the line of sight. Tie and Kochanek (2018) have proposed a new microlensing effect on time delays based on differential magnification of the accretion disc of the lensed quasar. If real, this effect could significantly broaden the uncertainty on the time delay measurements by up to $30\%$ for lens systems such as PG1115+080, which have relatively short time delays and monitoring over several different epochs. In this paper we develop a new technique that uses the time-delay ratios and simulated microlensing maps within a Bayesian framework in order to limit the allowed combinations of microlensing delays and thus to lessen the uncertainties due to the proposed effect. We show that, under the assumption of Tie and Kochanek (2018), the uncertainty on the time-delay distance ($D_{\Delta t}$, which is proportional to 1/$H_{0}$) of short time-delay ($\sim18$ days) lens, PG1115+080, increases from $\sim7\%$ to $\sim10\%$ by simultaneously fitting the three time-delay measurements from the three different datasets across twenty years, while in the case of long time-delay ($\sim90$ days) lens, the microlensing effect on time delays is negligible as the uncertainty on $D_{\Delta t}$ of RXJ1131-1231 only increases from $\sim2.5\%$ to $\sim2.6\%$.},

Here we address the possibility that the BHB shrinking rate is enhanced through the infall of a star cluster (SC) onto the BHB. We present the results of direct summation N-body simulations exploring different orbits for the SC infall, and we show that SCs reaching the BHB on non-zero angular momentum orbits (with eccentricity 0.75) fail to enhance the BHB hardening, while SCs approaching the BHB on radial orbits reduce the BHB separation by ~10% in less than 10 Myr, effectively shortening the BHB path towards GWs.},

  title       = {Assembly of supermassive black hole seeds},
  abstract    = {We present a suite of six fully cosmological, three-dimensional simulations of the collapse of an atomic cooling halo in the early Universe. We use the moving-mesh code arepo with an improved primordial chemistry network to evolve the hydrodynamical and chemical equations. The addition of a strong Lyman-Werner background suppresses molecular hydrogen cooling and permits the gas to evolve nearly isothermally at a temperature of about 8000 K. Strong gravitational torques effectively remove angular momentum and lead to the central collapse of gas, forming a supermassive protostar at the center of the halo. We model the protostar using two methods: sink particles that grow through mergers with other sink particles, and a stiff equation of state that leads to the formation of an adiabatic core. We impose threshold densities of $10^8$, $10^{10}$, and $10^{12}\,\text{cm}^{-3}$ for the sink particle formation and the onset of the stiff equation of state to study the late, intermediate, and early stages in the evolution of the protostar, respectively. We follow its growth from masses $\simeq 10\,\text{M}_\odot$ to $\simeq 10^5\,\text{M}_\odot$, with an average accretion rate of $\langle\dot{M}_\star\rangle \simeq 2\,\text{M}_\odot\,\text{yr}^{-1}$ for sink particles, and $\simeq 0.8 - 1.4\,\text{M}_\odot\,\text{yr}^{-1}$ for the adiabatic cores. At the end of the simulations, the HII region generated by radiation from the central object has long detached from the protostellar photosphere, but the ionizing radiation remains trapped in the inner host halo, and has thus not yet escaped into the intergalactic medium. Fully coupled, radiation-hydrodynamics simulations hold the key for further progress.},

  title       = {Stellar-mass black holes in young massive and open stellar clusters and their role in gravitational-wave generation III: dissecting black hole dynamics},
  abstract    = {Stellar-remnant black holes (BH) in dense stellar clusters comprise a natural setup to trigger general-relativistic (GR) inspiral and merger of binary black holes (BBH), detectable by the LISA and the LIGO-Virgo, through dynamical encounters inside such environments. In this work, the intricacies of such dynamical interactions are probed utilizing realistic, self-consistent, post-Newtonian, direct N-body evolutionary models of young massive and open stellar clusters. Particularly, the configurations of the compact subsystems, that drive the in-cluster GR BBH coalescences, are live-tracked. Such an approach reveals that the GR coalescences within the open clusters take place primarily via chaotic interactions involving triple BH systems. Although less frequently, such mergers are found to happen also in higher-order subsystems such as quadruples and in subsystems involving non-BH members; the mergers can themselves be BH---non-BH, which events would leave electromagnetic signatures. Close, fly-by encounters inside the clusters can also make BBHs and other types of double-compact binaries temporarily post-Newtonian; such binaries would potentially contribute to the GW background for the LISA and the PTA. These calculations, furthermore, suggest that open clusters are potential hosts for not only detached BH---main-sequence binaries, as recently identified in the globular cluster NGC 3201, but also a wide variety of other types of remnant---non-remnant binaries, which are assembled via dynamical interactions inside the clusters and which have the prospects of being discovered in radial-velocity surveys.},

  abstract    = {We explain flat rotation curves and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation by a combination of three hypotheses. The first is a formulation of the equivalence principle for gravitationally bound quantum $N$ body systems, while the second is a second order phase transition hypothesized to arise from a competition between the effects of Unruh and deSitter radiation experienced by a static observer in a galaxy. The third is a light dark matter particle, coupled to a dark photon. The phase transition is triggered in a ring where the Unruh temperature of a static observer falls below the deSitter temperature, thus explaining the apparent coincidence that Milgrom's $a_0 \approx a_\Lambda = c^2 \sqrt{\frac{\Lambda}{3}}$ This phase transition drives the dark matter particles to a regime characterized by a broken $U(1)$ invariance and an approximate scale invariance. In this regime, the dark matter condenses to a super-current characterized by a differentially rotating ring with a flat rotation curve, coupled to a dark magnetic field. The baryonic Tully Fisher relation is a direct consequence of the approximate scale invariance.},

We first use these sources to optimize the parameters in the standard model and show that they are consistent with Planck, though the quality of the best fit is not satisfactory. We demonstrate that this is likely due to under-reported errors, or to errors yet to be included in this kind of analysis. We suggest that the missing dispersion may be due to scatter about a pure single isothermal sphere (SIS) model that is often assumed for the mass distribution in these lenses. We then use the Bayes information criterion, with the inclusion of a suggested SIS dispersion, to calculate the relative likelihoods and ranking of these models, showing that Milne and Einstein-de Sitter are completely ruled out, while R_h=ct is preferred over LCDM/wCDM with a relative probability of ~73% versus ~24%. The recently reported sample of new strong lens candidates by the Dark Energy Survey, if confirmed, may be able to demonstrate which of these two models is favoured over the other at a level exceeding 3 sigma.},

  abstract    = {The violation of the weak equivalence principle (EP) in the gravitational field of the Earth, described by the E\"otv\"os parameter $\eta_\oplus$, was recently constrained to the level $\left|\eta_\oplus\right| \lesssim 10^{-14}$ by the MICROSCOPE space mission. The E\"otv\"os parameter $\eta_{\rm DM}$, pertaining to the differential couplings of dark matter (DM) and ordinary matter, was only tested to the level $\left| \eta_{\rm DM} \right| \lesssim 10^{-5}$ by the E\"ot-Wash group and lunar laser ranging. This test is limited by the EP-violating driving force in the Solar neighborhood that is determined by the Galactic distribution of DM. Here we propose a novel celestial experiment using the orbital dynamics from radio timing of binary pulsars, and obtain a competing limit on $\eta_{\rm DM}$ from a neutron star (NS) -- white dwarf (WD) system, PSR J1713+0747. The result benefits from the large material difference between the NS and the WD, and the large gravitational binding energy of the NS. If we can discover a binary pulsar within $\sim 10$ parsecs of the Galactic center, where the driving force is much larger in the expected DM spike, precision timing will improve the test of the universality of free fall towards DM and constrain various proposed couplings of DM to the Standard Model by several orders of magnitude. Such a test probes the hypothesis that gravity is the only long-range interaction between DM and ordinary matter.},

We combine constraints from a catalog of 1344 weakly lensed galaxies and 39 multiply-imaged sources comprised of 114 multiple images, including a system of multiply-imaged candidates at $z=7.93 \pm 0.02$, to obtain a best-fit mass distribution using the cluster lens modeling code Strong and Weak Lensing United. As the only analysis of A370 using strong and weak lensing constraints from Hubble Frontier Fields data, our method provides an independent check on assumptions in other methods on the mass distribution. Convergence, shear, and magnification maps are made publicly available through the HFF website. We find that the model we produce is similar to models produced by other groups, with some exceptions due to the differences in lensing code methodology. In an effort to study how our total projected mass distribution traces light, we measure the stellar mass density distribution using Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera imaging. Comparing our total mass density to our stellar mass density in a radius of 0.3 Mpc, we find a mean projected stellar to total mass ratio of $\langle f* \rangle = 0.011 \pm 0.003$ (stat.) using the diet Salpeter initial mass function. This value is in general agreement with independent measurements of $\langle f* \rangle$ in clusters of similar total mass and redshift.},

  abstract    = {We report results from very long baseline interferometric (VLBI) observations of the supermassive black hole in the Galactic center, Sgr A*, at 1.3 mm (230 GHz). The observations were performed in 2013 March using six VLBI stations in Hawaii, California, Arizona, and Chile. Compared to earlier observations, the addition of the APEX telescope in Chile almost doubles the longest baseline length in the array, provides additional {\it uv} coverage in the N-S direction, and leads to a spatial resolution of $\sim$30 $\mu$as ($\sim$3 Schwarzschild radii) for Sgr A*. The source is detected even at the longest baselines with visibility amplitudes of $\sim$4-13% of the total flux density. We argue that such flux densities cannot result from interstellar refractive scattering alone, but indicate the presence of compact intrinsic source structure on scales of $\sim$3 Schwarzschild radii. The measured nonzero closure phases rule out point-symmetric emission. We discuss our results in the context of simple geometric models that capture the basic characteristics and brightness distributions of disk- and jet-dominated models and show that both can reproduce the observed data. Common to these models are the brightness asymmetry, the orientation, and characteristic sizes, which are comparable to the expected size of the black hole shadow. Future 1.3 mm VLBI observations with an expanded array and better sensitivity will allow a more detailed imaging of the horizon-scale structure and bear the potential for a deep insight into the physical processes at the black hole boundary.},

We identify three systems of multiply-imaged lensed galaxies, two of which we spectroscopically confirm at $z=1.358$ and $z=4.013$, which we use as constraints for the model. We find a foreground structure at $z\sim0.4$, which we include as a second cluster-sized halo in one of our models; however two different statistical tests find the best-fit model consists of one cluster-sized halo combined with three individually optimized galaxy-sized halos, as well as contributions from the cluster galaxies themselves. We find the total projected mass density within $r=26.7"$ (the region where the strong lensing constraints exist) to be $M=2.51^{+0.15}\_{-0.09}\times 10^{14}$\~{}M$\_{\odot}$. If we extrapolate out to $r\_{500}$, our projected mass density is consistent with the mass inferred from weak lensing and from the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect ($M\sim10^{15}$\~{}M$\_{\odot}$). This cluster is lensing a previously reported $z\sim10$ galaxy, which, if spectroscopically confirmed, will be the highest-redshift strongly lensed galaxy known.},

  abstract    = {We present a detailed morphological study of TeV gamma rays, synchrotron radiation, and interstellar gas in the young Type Ia supernova remnant (SNR) RCW 86. We find that the interstellar atomic gas shows good spatial correlation with the gamma rays, indicating that the TeV gamma rays from RCW 86 are likely to be dominantly of hadronic origin. In contrast, the spatial correlation between the interstellar molecular cloud and the TeV gamma rays is poor in the southeastern shell of the SNR. We argue that this poor correlation can be attributed to the low-energy cosmic rays (~ 1 TeV) not penetrating into the dense molecular cloud due to an enhancement of the turbulent magnetic field around the dense cloud of ~ 10-100 $\mu$G. We also find that the southwestern shell, which is bright in both synchrotron X-ray and radio continuum radiation, shows a significant gamma-ray excess compared with the interstellar proton column density, suggesting that leptonic gamma rays via inverse Compton scattering possibly contributes along with hadronic gamma rays. The total cosmic-ray energies of the young TeV gamma-ray SNRs$-$RX J1713.7$-$3946, Vela Jr, HESS J1731$-$347, and RCW 86$-$are roughly similar, which indicates that cosmic rays can be accelerated in both the core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae. The total energy of cosmic rays derived using the gas density, ~ 10$^{48}$-10$^{49}$ erg, gives a safe lower limit due mainly to the low filling factor of interstellar gas within the shell. We also note that the index of the proton spectrum is possibly related with the abundance ratio of atomic to molecular gases, which corresponds to the inhomogeneity of interstellar gas.},

The $g2$-space geometries of the models and data from the SPARC database are classified and compared in a rescaled $\hat{g}2$-space that reduces systematic uncertainties on galaxy distance, inclination angle and variations in mass to light ratios. We find that MOND modified inertia models, frequently used to fit rotation curve data, are disfavoured at more than 5$\sigma$ independent of model details. The Bekenstein-Milgrom formulation of MOND modified gravity compares better with data in the analytic approximation we use. However a quantitative comparison with data is beyond the scope of the paper due to this approximation. NFW DM profiles only agree with a minority of galactic rotation curves. Improved measurements of rotation curves, in particular at radii below the maximum of the total and the baryonic accelerations of the curves are very important in discriminating models aiming to explain the missing mass problem on galactic scales.},

As a case study, we test it with a sample of four quadruple lenses, both in simulated scenarios and with real data from the $\textit{Chandra X-ray Observatory}$. In our simulations with a uniform stellar population the method works best to detect sources around $0.1$ Einstein radii, giving correct upper/lower limits for much smaller/bigger sizes without requiring a big leap in additional computational effort as compared to a single-epoch approach, yet taking advantage of multi-epoch information. We apply the method to a small sample of X-ray data from four objects assuming a range of star masses, and obtain a degeneracy relation between the source size and deflector mass. Combined with previous estimates for the size of the X-ray corona, the degeneracy relation suggests that X-ray microlensing is mainly induced by planetary mass objects.},

  abstract    = {Context. Gaia DR2 offers unparalleled precision on stars' parallaxes and proper motions. This allows the prediction of microlensing events for which the lens stars (and any planets they possess) are nearby and may be well studied and characterised. Aims. We identify a number of potential microlensing events that will occur before the year 2035.5, 20 years from the Gaia DR2 reference epoch. Methods. We query Gaia DR2 for potential lenses within 100 pc, extract parallaxes and proper motions of the lenses and background sources, and identify potential lensing events. We estimate the lens masses from Priam effective temperatures, and use these to calculate peak magnifications and the size of the Einstein radii relative to the lens stars' habitable zones. Results. We identify 7 future events with a probability > 10% of an alignment within one Einstein radius. Of particular interest is DR2 5918299904067162240 (WISE J175839.20-583931.6), magnitude G = 14.9, which will lens a G = 13.9 background star in early 2030, with a median 23% net magnification. Other pairs are typically fainter, hampering characterisation of the lens (if the lens is faint) or the ability to accurately measure the magnification (if the source is much fainter than the lens). Of timely interest is DR2 4116504399886241792 (2MASS J17392440-2327071), which will lens a background star in July 2020, albeit with weak net magnification (0.03%). Median magnifications for the other 5 high-probability events range from 0.3% to 5.3%. The Einstein radii for these lenses are 1-10 times the radius of the habitable zone, allowing these lensing events to pick out cold planets around the ice line. Conclusions. We provide a catalogue of the predicted events to aid future characterisation efforts... [abridged]},

  abstract      = {Screened modified gravity models are viable alternatives to dark energy for driving the accelerated expansion of the Universe. They can exhibit complex behaviour on galactic and intergalactic scales, where current constraints on gravity are relatively weak, without violating stringent Solar System tests. In this work, we explore the viability of using the kinematics of galaxies to constrain screened modified gravity models. We focus on chameleon f(R) gravity and predict its impact on galaxy rotation curves and radial acceleration relations. This is achieved by post-processing state-of-the-art simulations of disc galaxy formation from the Auriga Project, using the MG-Gadget modified gravity code. We find that for a given galaxy, the surface dividing screened and unscreened regions adopts an oblate shape, reflecting the disc morphology of the galaxy. At the 'screening radius'---the radius at which screening is triggered in the disc plane---characteristic 'upturns' are present in both rotation curves and radial acceleration relations. The location of these features depends on various factors, such as the galaxy mass, the concentration of the density profile and the value of the background field amplitude fR0. Self-screening of stars and environmental screening also play a role. For Milky Way-size galaxies, we find that a model with $|\bar{f}\_\mathrm{R0}|=10^{-7}$ results in rotation curves that are indistinguishable from $\Lambda$CDM, while for $|\bar{f}\_\mathrm{R0}| \geq 2 \times 10^{-6}$ the simulated galaxies are entirely unscreened, violating Solar System constraints. For intermediate values, distinct upturns are present. With careful statistical analyses of observed rotation curves, constraints on f(R) gravity with a sensitivity down to $|\bar{f}\_\mathrm{R0}|\sim10^{-7}$ should be possible.},

  abstract      = {The search for intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in the centre of globular clusters is often based on the observation of a central cusp in the surface brightness profile and a rise towards the centre in the velocity dispersion profiles. Similar signatures, however, could result from other effects, that need to be taken into account in order to determine the presence (or the absence) of an IMBH in these stellar systems. Following our previous exploration of the role of radial anisotropy in shaping these observational signatures, we analyse here the effects produced by the presence of a population of centrally concentrated stellar-mass black holes. We fit dynamical models to omega Cen data, and we show that models with \~{}5\% of their mass in black holes (consistent with \~{}100\% retention fraction after natal kicks) can reproduce the data. When simultaneously considering both radial anisotropy and mass segregation, the best-fit model includes a smaller population of remnants, and a less extreme degree of anisotropy with respect to the models that include only one of these features. These results underline that before conclusions about putative IMBHs can be made, the effects of stellar-mass black holes and radial anisotropy need to be properly accounted for.},

To facilitate this opportunity we present a new method for the reconstruction of the quasi-linear matter density and velocity fields from galaxy peculiar velocities and apply it to the Cosmicflows-2 data. The method consists of constructing an ensemble of cosmological simulations, constrained by the standard cosmological model and the observational data. The quasi-linear density field is the geometric mean and variance of the fully non-linear density fields of the simulations. The main nearby clusters (Virgo, Centaurus, Coma), superclusters (Shapley, Perseus-Pisces) and voids (Dipole Repeller) are robustly reconstructed. Galaxies are born biased with respect to the underlying dark matter distribution. Using our quasi-linear framework we demonstrate that the luminosity-weighted density field derived from the 2M++ redshift compilations is non-linearly biased with respect to the matter density field. The bias diminishes in the linear regime.},

  abstract      = {There is undetermined potential function $V(\phi)$ in the action of mimetic gravity which should be resolved through physical means. In general relativity(GR), the static spherically symmetric(SSS) solution to the Einstein equation is a benchmark and its deformation also plays a crucial role in mimetic gravity. The equation of motion is provided with high nonlinearity, but we can reduce primal nonlinearity to a frequent Riccati form in the SSS case of mimetic gravity. In other words, we obtain an expression of solution to the functional differential equation of motion with any potential function. Remarkably, we proved rigorously that there is a zero point of first order for the metric function $\beta(r)$ if another metric function $\alpha(r)$ possesses a pole of first order within mimetic gravity. The zero point theorem may be regarded as the generalization of Birkhoff theorem $\alpha\beta=1$ in GR. As a corollary, we show that there is a modified black hole solution for any given $V(\phi)$, which can pass the test of solar system. As another corollary, the zero point theorem provides a dynamical mechanism for the maximum size of galaxies. Especially, there are two analytic solutions which provide good fits to the rotation curves of galaxies without the demand for particle dark matter.},

  abstract      = {A wavelike solution for the non-relativistic universal dark matter (wave-DM) is rapidly gaining interest, following distinctive predictions of pioneering simulations of cosmic structure as an interference pattern of coherently oscillating bosons. A prominent solitonic standing wave is predicted at the center of every galaxy, representing the ground state, that has been identified with the wide, kpc scale dark cores of common dwarf-spheroidal galaxies, providing a boson mass of, $\simeq 10^{-22}$ eV. A denser soliton is predicted for Milky Way sized galaxies where momentum is higher, so the de Broglie scale of the soliton is smaller, $\simeq 100pc$, of mass $\simeq 10^9 M\_\odot$. Here we show the central motion of bulge stars in the Milky Way implies the presence of such a dark core, where the velocity dispersion rises inversely with radius to a maximum of $\simeq 130km/s$, corresponding to an excess central mass of $\simeq 1.5\times 10^9M\_\odot$ within $\simeq 100$ pc, favouring a boson mass of $\simeq 10^{-22}$ eV. This quantitative agreement with such a unique and distinctive prediction is therefore strong evidence for a light bosonic solution to the long standing Dark Matter puzzle, such as the axions generic in String Theory.},

  month         = jul,
  abstract      = {Intra-galaxy signals contain a wealth of information on fundamental physics, both the dark sector and the nature of gravity. While so far largely unexplored, such probes are set to rise dramatically in importance as upcoming surveys provide data of unprecedented quantity and quality on galaxy structure and dynamics. In this paper, we use warping of stellar disks to test the chameleon- or symmetron-screened fifth forces which generically arise when new fields couple to matter. We take r-band images of mostly late-type galaxies from the Nasa Sloan Atlas and develop an automated algorithm to quantify the degree of U-shaped warping they exhibit. We then forward-model the warp signal as a function of fifth-force strength $\Delta G/G\_N$ and range $\lambda\_C$, and the gravitational environments and internal properties of the galaxies, including full propagation of the non-Gaussian uncertainties. Convolving this fifth-force likelihood function with a Gaussian describing astrophysical and observational noise and then constraining $\Delta G/G\_N$ and $\lambda\_C$ by Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we find the overall likelihood to be significant increased ($\Delta\log(\mathcal{L}) \simeq 20$) by adding a screened fifth force with $\lambda\_C \simeq 2$ Mpc, $\Delta G/G\_N \simeq 0.01$. The variation of $\Delta\log(\mathcal{L})$ with $\lambda\_C$ is quantitatively as expected from the correlation of the magnitude of the fifth-force field with the force's range, and a similar model without screening achieves no increase in likelihood over the General Relativistic case $\Delta G=0$. Although these results are in good agreement with a previous analysis of the same model using offsets between galaxies' stellar and gas mass centroids (Desmond et al. 2018), we caution that the effects of confounding baryonic and dark matter physics must be thoroughly investigated for the results of the inference to be unambiguous.},

When all of these observables commute, our proposal differs little from the treatment given to classical parameters in quantum information theory, at least if we were to inhabit a constants' eigenstate. Non-commutativity introduces novelties, due to its associated uncertainty and complementarity principles, and it may even preclude hamiltonian evolution. The system typically evolves as a quantum superposition of hamiltonian evolutions resulting from a diagonalization process, and these are usually quite distinct from the original one (defined in terms of the non-commuting constants). We present several examples targeting $G$, $c$ and $\Lambda $, and the dynamics of homogeneous and isotropic Universes. If we base our construction on the Heisenberg algebra and the quantum harmonic oscillator, the alternative dynamics tends to silence matter (effectively setting $G$ to zero), and make curvature and the cosmological constant act as if their signs are reversed. Thus, the early Universe expands as a quantum superposition of different Milne or de Sitter expansions for all material equations of state, even though matter nominally dominates the density, $\rho $, because of the negligible influence of $G\rho $ on the dynamics. A superposition of Einstein static universes can also be obtained. We also investigate the results of basing our construction on the algebra of $SU(2)$, into which we insert information about the sign of a constant of Nature, or whether its action is switched on or off. In this case we find examples displaying quantum superpositions of bounces at the initial state for the Universe.},

  abstract      = {In the first part of this note, we observe that a non-Riemannian piece in the affine connection (a ``dark connection'') leads to an algebraically determined, conserved, symmetric 2-tensor in the Einstein field equations that is a natural dark matter candidate. The only other effect it has, is through its coupling to standard model fermions via covariant derivatives. If the local dark matter density is the result of a background classical dark connection, these Yukawa-like mass corrections are minuscule ($\sim 10^{-31}$ eV for terrestrial fermions) and $\{$$\backslash$em none$\}$ of the tests of general relativity or the equivalence principle are affected. In the second part of the note, we give dynamics to the dark connection and show how it can be re-interpreted in terms of conventional dark matter particles. The simplest way to do this is to treat it as a composite field involving scalars or vectors. The (pseudo-)scalar model naturally has a perturbative shift-symmetry and leads to versions of the Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) scenario that has recently become popular (eg., arXiv:1610.08297) as an alternative to WIMPs. A vector model with a ${\cal Z}\_2$-parity falls into the Planckian Interacting Dark Matter (PIDM) paradigm, introduced in arXiv:1511.03278. It is possible to construct versions of these theories that yield the correct relic density, fit with inflation, and are falsifiable in the next round of CMB experiments. Our work is an explicit demonstration that the meaningful distinction is not between gravity modification and dark matter, but between theories with extra fields and those without.},
