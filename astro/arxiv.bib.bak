  abstract      = {We study Red Misfits, a population of red, star-forming galaxies in the local Universe. We classify galaxies based on inclination-corrected optical colours and specific star formation rates derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7. Although the majority of blue galaxies are star-forming and most red galaxies exhibit little to no ongoing star formation, a small but significant population of galaxies ($\sim$11 per cent at all stellar masses) are classified as red in colour yet actively star-forming. We explore a number of properties of these galaxies and demonstrate that Red Misfits are not simply dusty or highly-inclined blue cloud galaxies or quiescent red galaxies with poorly-constrained star formation. The proportion of Red Misfits is nearly independent of environment and this population exhibits both intermediate morphologies and an enhanced likelihood of hosting an AGN. We conclude that Red Misfits are a transition population, gradually quenching on their way to the red sequence and this quenching is dominated by internal processes rather than environmentally-driven processes. We discuss the connection between Red Misfits and other transition galaxy populations, namely S0's, red spirals and green valley galaxies.},

  abstract      = {We detect bright emission in the far infrared fine structure [O III] 88$\mu$m line from a strong lensing candidate galaxy, H-ATLAS J113526.3-014605, hereafter G12v2.43, at z=3.127, using the $\rm 2^{nd}$ generation Redshift (z) and Early Universe Spectrometer (ZEUS-2) at the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment Telescope (APEX). This is only the fifth detection of this far-IR line from a sub-millimeter galaxy at the epoch of galaxy assembly. The observed [O III] luminosity of $7.1\times10^{9}\,\rm(\frac{10}{\mu})\,\rm{L\_{\odot}}\,$ likely arises from HII regions around massive stars, and the amount of Lyman continuum photons required to support the ionization indicate the presence of $(1.2-5.2)\times10^{6}\,\rm(\frac{10}{\mu})$ equivalent O5.5 or higher stars; where $\mu$ would be the lensing magnification factor. The observed line luminosity also requires a minimum mass of $\sim 2\times 10^{8}\,\rm(\frac{10}{\mu})\,\rm{M\_{\odot}}\,$ in ionized gas, that is $0.33\\%$ of the estimated total molecular gas mass of $6\times10^{10}\,\rm(\frac{10}{\mu})\,\rm{M\_{\odot}}\,$. We compile multi-band photometry tracing rest-frame UV to millimeter continuum emission to further constrain the properties of this dusty high redshift star-forming galaxy. Via SED modeling we find G12v2.43 is forming stars at a rate of 916 $\rm(\frac{10}{\mu})\,\rm{M\_{\odot}}\,\rm{yr^{-1}}$ and already has a stellar mass of $8\times 10^{10}\,\rm(\frac{10}{\mu})\,\rm{M\_{\odot}}\,$. We also constrain the age of the current starburst to be $\leqslant$ 5 million years, making G12v2.43 a gas rich galaxy lying above the star-forming main sequence at z$\sim$3, undergoing a growth spurt and, could be on the main sequence within the derived gas depletion timescale of $\sim$66 million years.},

  abstract      = {VANDELS is a uniquely-deep spectroscopic survey of high-redshift galaxies with the VIMOS spectrograph on ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT). The survey has obtained ultra-deep optical (0.48 $\lt$ lambda $\lt$ 1.0 micron) spectroscopy of \~{}2100 galaxies within the redshift interval 1.0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 7.0, over a total area of \~{}0.2 sq. degrees centred on the CANDELS UDS and CDFS fields. Based on accurate photometric redshift pre-selection, 85\% of the galaxies targeted by VANDELS were selected to be at z$\gt$=3. Exploiting the red sensitivity of the refurbished VIMOS spectrograph, the fundamental aim of the survey is to provide the high signal-to-noise ratio spectra necessary to measure key physical properties such as stellar population ages, masses, metallicities and outflow velocities from detailed absorption-line studies. Using integration times calculated to produce an approximately constant signal-to-noise ratio (20 $\lt$ t\_int $\lt$ 80 hours), the VANDELS survey targeted: a) bright star-forming galaxies at 2.4 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 5.5, b) massive quiescent galaxies at 1.0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2.5, c) fainter star-forming galaxies at 3.0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 7.0 and d) X-ray/Spitzer-selected active galactic nuclei and Herschel-detected galaxies. By targeting two extragalactic survey fields with superb multi-wavelength imaging data, VANDELS will produce a unique legacy data set for exploring the physics underpinning high-redshift galaxy evolution. In this paper we provide an overview of the VANDELS survey designed to support the science exploitation of the first ESO public data release, focusing on the scientific motivation, survey design and target selection.},

We study the properties of star-forming group galaxies, exploring the correlation of star formation rate (SFR) with radial distance and stellar mass. We find that the fraction of star-forming group members is higher in the PPS regions dominated by recently accreted galaxies, whereas passive galaxies dominate the virialized regions. We observe a small decline in specific SFR of star-forming galaxies towards the group center by a factor $\sim 1.2$ with respect to field galaxies. Similar to cluster studies, we conclude for low-mass halos that star-forming group galaxies represent an infalling population from the field to the halo and show suppressed star formation.},

We match samples at different redshifts in UV luminosity and stellar mass, and perform systematic measurements of spectral features and stellar population modeling. By creating composite spectra grouped according to Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW), and various galaxy properties, we study the evolutionary trends among Ly$\alpha$, low- and high-ionization interstellar (LIS and HIS) absorption features, and integrated galaxy properties. We also examine the redshift evolution of Ly$\alpha$ and LIS absorption kinematics, and fine-structure emission EWs. The connections among the strengths of Ly$\alpha$, LIS lines, and dust extinction are redshift-independent, as is the decoupling of Ly$\alpha$ and HIS line strengths, and the bulk outflow kinematics as traced by LIS lines. Stronger Ly$\alpha$ emission is observed at higher redshift at fixed UV luminosity, stellar mass, SFR, and age. Much of this variation in average Ly$\alpha$ strength with redshift, and the variation in Ly$\alpha$ strength at fixed redshift, can be explained in terms of variations in neutral gas covering fraction and/or dust content in the ISM and CGM. However, based on the connection between Ly$\alpha$ and CIII] emission strengths, we additionally find evidence for variations in the intrinsic production rate of Ly$\alpha$ photons at the highest Ly$\alpha$ EWs. The challenge now is to understand the observed evolution in neutral gas covering fraction and dust extinction within a coherent model for galaxy formation, and make robust predictions for the escape of ionizing radiation at z $\gt$ 6.},

  abstract      = {We analyze the stellar growth of Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) produced by cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamical simulations of the formation of massive galaxy clusters. The evolution of the stellar mass content is studied considering different apertures, and tracking backwards either the main progenitor of the $z=0$ BCG or that of the cluster hosting the BCG at $z=0$. Both methods lead to similar results up to $z \simeq 1.5$. The simulated BCGs masses at $z=0$ are in agreement with recent observations. In the redshift interval from z=1 to z=0 we find growth factors 1.3, 1.6 and 3.6 for stellar masses within 30kpc, 50kpc and 10\% of R\_$\{$500$\}$ respectively. The first two factors, and in general the mass evolution in this redshift range, are in agreement with most recent observations. The last larger factor is similar to the growth factor obtained by a semi-analytical model (SAM). Half of the star particles that end up in the inner 50 kpc was typically formed by redshift about 3.7, while the assembly of half of the BCGs stellar mass occurs on average at lower redshifts $\sim 1.5$. This assembly redshift correlates with the mass attained by the cluster at high $z \gtrsim 1.3$, due to the broader range of the progenitor clusters at high-z. The assembly redshift of BCGs decreases with increasing apertures. Our results are compatible with the inside-out scenario. Simulated BCGs could lack intense enough star formation (SF) at high redshift, while possibly exhibit an excess of residual SF at low redshift.},

  abstract      = {We report optical properties of infrared (IR)-bright dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) that are defined as (i-[22])\_AB $\gt$ 7.0. Since supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in IR-bright DOGs are expected to be rapidly growing in the major merger scenario, they provide useful clues to understand the co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies. However the optical properties of IR-bright DOGs are still unclear, because the optical emission of DOGs is very faint. By combining \~{} 53 deg\^{}2 images of the optical, near-IR, and mid-IR data that are obtained with the Subaru Hyper Suprime Cam (HSC) survey, VISTA VIKING survey, and WISE all-sky survey, respectively, 427 IR-bright DOGs are selected. We find that IR-bright DOGs show a redder (g-z)\_AB color than other populations of dusty galaxies such as ultra-luminous IR galaxies (ULIRGs) at a similar redshift, with a significantly large dispersion. Among the selected DOGs, star-formation (SF)-dominated DOGs show a relatively red color while active galactic nucleus (AGN)-dominated DOGs show a rather blue color in optical. This result is consistent with the idea that the relative AGN contribution in the optical emission becomes more significant at a late stage in the major merger scenario. Roughly 2\% of AGN-dominated DOGs show a significant blue excess in blue HSC bands (BluDOGs), which can be interpreted as a leaked AGN emission as proposed for some blue-excess Hot DOGs in earlier works.},

Here our aim is to pinpoint NGC 1275 on the less dispersed scaling relations, namely the M\_BH-sigma\_star and M\_BH-L\_bul planes. Starting from our previous work Ricci et al. 2017b, we estimate that NGC 1275 falls well outside the intrinsic dispersion of the M\_BH-sigma\_star plane being \~{}1.2 dex (in black hole mass) displaced with respect to the scaling relations. We then perform a 2D morphological decomposition analysis on Spitzer/IRAC images at 3.6 mic and find that, beyond the bright compact nucleus that dominates the central emission, NGC 1275 follows a de Vaucouleurs profile with no sign of significant star formation nor clear merger remnants.

However, the relation between galaxies and environment is still not well understood. Here we present a machine learning approach to study imprints of environmental effects on the mass assembly of haloes. We present a galaxy-LSS machine learning classifier based on galaxy properties sensitive to the environment. We then use the classifier to assess the relevance of each property. Correlations between galaxy properties and their cosmic environment can be used to predict galaxy membership to void/wall or filament/cluster with an accuracy of $93\\%$. Our study unveils environmental information encoded in properties of haloes not normally considered directly dependent on the cosmic environment such as merger history and complexity. Understanding the physical mechanism by which the cosmic web is imprinted in a halo can lead to significant improvements in galaxy formation models. This is accomplished by extracting features from galaxy properties and merger trees, computing feature scores for each feature and then applying support vector machine to different feature sets. To this end, we have discovered that the shape and depth of the merger tree, formation time and density of the galaxy are strongly associated with the cosmic environment. We describe a significant improvement in the original classification algorithm by performing LU decomposition of the distance matrix computed by the feature vectors and then using the output of the decomposition as input vectors for support vector machine.},

  abstract      = {Although more than two-thirds of star-forming disk galaxies in the local universe are barred, some galaxies remain un-barred, occupying the upper half of the Hubble tuning fork diagram. Numerical simulations almost always produce bars spontaneously, so it remains a challenge to understand how galaxies sometimes prevent bars from forming. Using a set of collisionless simulations, we first reproduce the common result that cold stellar disks surrounding a classical bulge become strongly unstable to non-axisymmetric perturbations, leading to the rapid formation of spiral structure and bars. However, our analyses show that galaxy models with compact classical bulges (whose average density is greater than or comparable to the disk density calculated within bulge half-mass radii) are able to prevent bar formation for at least 4 Gyr even when the stellar disk is maximal and having low Toomre Q. Such bar prevention is the result of several factors such as (a) a small inner Lindblad resonance with a high angular rate, which contaminates an incipient bar with $x\_2$ orbits, (b) rapid loss of angular momentum accompanied by a rapid heating in the center from initially strong bar and spiral instabilities in a low-Q disk, in other words, a rapid initial rise to a value larger than $\sim5$ of the ratio of the random energy to the rotational energy in the central region of the galaxy.},

We demonstrate that the correlation between the stellar mass surface density ($\Sigma\_*$) and star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma\_{\mathrm{SFR}}$) holds down to sub-galactic scale, leading to the Sub-Galactic Main Sequence (SGMS). By dividing galaxies into two populations based on their recent mass assembly modes, we find the resolved main sequence in galaxies with 'outside-in' mode is steeper than that in galaxies with 'inside-out' mode. This is also confirmed on a galaxy-by-galaxy level, where we find the distributions of SGMS slopes for individual galaxies are clearly separated for the two populations. When normalizing and stacking the SGMS of individual galaxies on one panel for the two populations, we find the inner regions of galaxies with 'inside-out' mode statistically exhibit a suppression in star formation, with a less significant trend in the outer regions of galaxies with 'outside-in' mode. In contrast, the inner regions of galaxies with 'outside-in' mode and the outer regions of galaxies with 'inside-out' mode follow a slightly sub-linear scaling relation with a slope $\sim$0.9, which is in good agreement with previous findings, suggesting that they are experiencing a universal regulation without influences of additional physical processes.},

We spectroscopically identify 4, 12, and 7 GC satellites of these UDGs, respectively. We find that the three UDGs have systemic velocities ($V\_{sys}$) consistent with being in the Virgo cluster, and that they span a wide range of velocity dispersions, from $\sim 16$ to $\sim 47$ km/s, and high dynamical mass-to-light ratios within the radius that contains half the number of GCs ($ 407^{+916}\_{-407}$, $21^{+15}\_{-11}$, $60^{+65}\_{-38}$, respectively). VLSB-D shows possible evidence for rotation along the stellar major axis and its $V\_{sys}$ is consistent with that of the massive galaxy M84 and the center of the Virgo cluster itself. These findings, in addition to having a dynamically and spatially ($\sim 1$ kpc) off-centered nucleus and being extremely elongated, suggest that VLSB-D could be tidally perturbed. On the contrary, VLSB-B and VCC615 show no signals of tidal deformation. Whereas the dynamics of VLSB-D suggest that it has a less massive dark matter halo than expected for its stellar mass, VLSB-B and VCC615 are consistent with a $\sim 10^{12}$ M$\_{\odot}$ dark matter halo. Although our samples of galaxies and GCs are small, these results suggest that UDGs may be a diverse population, with their low surface brightnesses being the result of very early formation, tidal disruption, or a combination of the two.},

  abstract      = {Irregular dwarf galaxies of the Local Group have very varied properties and star formation histories. Some of them formed the majority of their stars very late compared to the others. Extreme examples are Leo A and Aquarius which reached the peak of star formation at $z\lt1$ ( $\gt$ 6 Gyr after BB). This fact seemingly challenges the LCDM cosmology because the dark matter halos of these galaxies on average should assemble the majority of their masses before z\~{}2 ($\lt$3 Gyr after BB). In this work we investigate whether the delayed star formation histories of some irregular dwarf galaxies could be explained purely by the stochasticity of their mass assembly histories coupled with the effect of cosmic reionization. We develop a semi-analytic model to follow the accretion of baryonic matter, star formation and stellar feedback in dark matter halos with present day virial masses 10\^{}9 M\_Sun $\lt$ M $\lt$ 10\^{}11 M\_Sun and with different stochastic growth histories obtained using the PINOCCHIO code based on Lagrangian perturbation theory. We obtain the distributions of observable parameters and the evolution histories for these galaxies. Accretion of baryonic matter is strongly suppressed after the epoch of reionization in some models but they continue to accrete dark matter and eventually reach enough mass for accretion of baryonic matter to begin again. These ``reborn'' model galaxies show very similar delayed star formation histories to those of Leo A and Aquarius. We find that the stochasticity caused by mass assembly histories is enhanced in systems with virial masses \~{}10\^{}10 M\_Sun because of their sensitivity to the photoionizing intergalactic radiation field after the epoch of reionization. This results in qualitatively different star formation histories in late- and early-forming galaxies and it might explain the peculiar star formation histories of irregular dwarf galaxies such as Leo A and Aquarius.},

This large offset hampers follow-up surveys, galaxy pair statistics and correlations with quasar absorption lines when only lya is available. We propose diagnostics that can be used to recover the systemic redshift directly from the properties of the lya line profile. We use spectroscopic observations of Lyman-Alpha Emitters (LAEs) for which a precise measurement of the systemic redshift is available. Our sample contains 13 sources detected between z~3 and z~6 as part of various Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO). We also include a compilation of spectroscopic lya data from the literature spanning a wide redshift range (z~0-8). First, restricting our analysis to double-peaked lya spectra, we find a tight correlation between the velocity offset of the red peak with respect to the systemic redshift, Vpeak, and the separation of the peaks. Secondly, we find a correlation between Vpeak and the full width at half maximum of the lya line. Fitting formulas, to estimate systemic redshifts of galaxies with an accuracy of +-100 km/s when only the lya emission line is available, are given for the two methods.},

A characteristic scaling between the amplitude of the asymptotic velocity dispersion and the radius at which the flattening occurs is also expected. By comprehensively analyzing the dynamical behavior of $\sim$300 extremely low rotating elliptical galaxies from the MaNGA survey, we show this type of pressure supported systems to be consistent with MONDian expectations, for a range of central velocity dispersion values of $60 km/s < \sigma_{central}< 280 km/s $ and asymptotic velocity dispersion values of $28km/s < \sigma_{\infty}<250 km/s$. We find that a universal velocity dispersion profile accurately describes the studied systems; the predicted kinematics of extended gravity are verified for all well observed galaxies.},

  abstract    = {We identify optical emission-line features 700" (12 kpc) southwest of the nucleus of Centaurus A, roughly opposite the radio jet and well-known optical emission filaments associated with the northern radio structure. These regions are spatially associated with far-infrared emission peaks in a cold dust cloud identified using Herschel and Spitzer data, and there may be a mismatch between the low temperature of the dust and the expected heating effect of young stars. We use integral-field optical spectroscopy to trace the ratios of strong emission lines. Their ratios are consistent with photoionization in normal H II regions, by modest numbers of OB stars; they must be obscured along our line of sight. The location raises the question of whether this star-forming episode was enhanced or triggered by an outflow from the central parts of Centaurus A. Optical emission-line ratios and line widths limit the role of shocks on the gas, so any interaction with an outflow, either from the radio source or star formation in the gas-rich disk, can at most have compressed the gas weakly. We speculate that the presence of similar star-forming regions on both sides of the galaxy, contrasted with the difference in the character of the emission-line clouds, reflects the presence of a collimated radio jet to the northeast and perhaps anisotropic escape of ionizing radiation from the AGN. Star formation on the southwestern side of Cen A could be enhanced by a broad outflow, distinct from the radio jet and lobes. (abridged)},

  abstract    = {We test the recently proposed idea that outflows associated with Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) could be neutrino emitters in two complementary ways. First, we cross-correlate a list of 94 "bona fide" AGN outflows with the most complete and updated repository of IceCube neutrinos currently publicly available, assembled by us for this purpose. It turns out that AGN with outflows matched to an IceCube neutrino have outflow and kinetic energy rates, and bolometric powers larger than those of AGN with outflows not matched to neutrinos. Second, we carry out a statistical analysis on a catalogue of O III 5007 line profiles using a sample of 23,264 AGN at z < 0.4, a sub-sample of which includes mostly possible outflows sources. We find no significant evidence of an association between the AGN and the IceCube events, although we get the smallest p-values (~ 6 and 18 per cent respectively, pre-trial) for relatively high velocities and luminosities. Our results are consistent with a scenario where AGN outflows are neutrino emitters but at present do not provide a significant signal. This can be tested with better statistics and source stacking. A predominant role of AGN outflows in explaining the IceCube data appears in any case to be ruled out.},

Unlike for simple spherical accretion, in the case of disk accretion feedback processes do not set upper limits on stellar masses. At solar metallicity, launching of magneto-centrifugally-driven outflows is the dominant feedback process to set SFEs, while radiation pressure, which has been regarded to be pivotal, has only minor contribution even in the formation of over-100Msun stars. Photoevaporation becomes significant in over-20Msun star formation at low metallicities of $\lt$1e-2Zsun, where dust absorption of ionizing photons is inefficient. We conclude that if initial prestellar core properties are similar, then massive stars are rarer in extremely metal-poor environments of 1e-5 - 1e-3Zsun. Our results give new insight into the high-mass end of the initial mass function and its potential variation with galactic and cosmological environments.},

  abstract      = {We investigate the abundance and properties (especially, grain size) of dust in galaxy halos using available observational data in the literature. There are two major sets of data. One is (i) the reddening curves at redshifts $z\sim 1$ and 2 derived for Mg II absorbers, which are assumed to trace the medium in galaxy halos. The other is (ii) the cosmic extinction up to $z\sim 2$ mainly traced by distant background quasars. For (i), the observed reddening curves favor a grain radius of $a\sim 0.03~\mu$m for silicate, while graphite is not supported because of its strong 2175 $\backslash$AA$\backslash$ bump. Using amorphous carbon improves the fit to the reddening curves compared with graphite if the grain radius is $a\lesssim 0.03~\mu$m. For (ii), the cosmic extinction requires $\eta\gtrsim 10^{-2}$ ($\eta$ is the ratio of the halo dust mass to the stellar mass; the observationally suggested value is $\eta\sim 10^{-3}$) for silicate if $a\sim 0.03~\mu$m as suggested by the reddening curve constraint. Thus, for silicate, we do not find any grain radius that satisfies both (i) and (ii) unless the halo dust abundance is much larger than suggested by the observations. For amorphous carbon, in contrast, a wide range of grain radius ($a\sim 0.01$--0.3\~{}$\mu$m) is accepted by the cosmic extinction; thus, we find that a grain radius range of $a\sim 0.01$--0.03 $\mu$m is supported by combining (i) and (ii). We also discuss the origin of dust in galaxy halos, focusing on the importance of grain size in the physical mechanism of dust supply to galaxy halos.},

We use FIRE cosmological zoom-in simulations of three MW-mass disk galaxies to study the spatial distribution, chemistry, and kinematics of the oldest surviving stars ($z\_{\rm form} \gtrsim 5$) in MW-like galaxies. We predict the oldest stars to be less centrally concentrated at $z=0$ than stars formed at later times as a result of two processes. First, the majority of the oldest stars are not formed $\textit{in situ}$ but are accreted during hierarchical assembly. These $\textit{ex situ}$ stars are deposited on dispersion-supported, halo-like orbits but dominate over old stars formed $\textit{in situ}$ in the solar neighborhood, and in some simulations, even in the galactic center. Secondly, old stars formed $\textit{in situ}$ are driven outwards by bursty star formation and energetic feedback processes that create a time-varying gravitational potential at $z\gtrsim 2$, similar to the process that creates dark matter cores and expands stellar orbits in bursty dwarf galaxies. The total fraction of stars that are ancient is more than an order of magnitude higher for sight lines $\textit{away}$ from the bulge and inner halo than for inward-looking sight lines. Although the task of identifying specific stars as ancient remains challenging, we anticipate that million-star spectral surveys and photometric surveys targeting metal-poor stars already include hundreds of stars formed before $z=5$. We predict most of these targets to have higher metallicity ($-3 \lt \rm [Fe/H] \lt -2$) than the most extreme metal-poor stars.},

The SMC has a non-planar structure that can be described as an ellipsoid extended almost along the line of sight. We also classified nine of our CCs as Magellanic Bridge objects. These Cepheids show a large spread in three-dimensions. For the RRL stars, we calculated distances based on photometric metallicities and theoretical relations. Both Magellanic Clouds revealed a very regular structure. We fitted triaxial ellipsoids to our LMC and SMC samples. In the LMC we noticed a very prominent, non-physical blend-artifact that prevented us from analyzing the central parts of this galaxy.

We find the spatial distribution of stars to vary as a function of the colour/metallicity, being rather regular and round for the blue (metal-poor) red giant branch and main-sequence turn-off stars but much more elliptical and irregularly shaped for the red (metal-rich) ones, with a clear ``shell-like'' overdensity in the northeast side. We also detect kinematic anomalies, in the form of a ``ring-like'' feature with a considerably larger systemic line-of-sight velocity and lower metallicity than the rest of stars; even the photometrically selected component with a regular looking spatial distribution displays complex kinematics.

  abstract      = {An increasing number of hundred-parsec scale, high line-mass filaments have been detected in the Galaxy. Their evolutionary path, including fragmentation towards star formation, is virtually unknown. We characterize the fragmentation within the Nessie filament, covering size-scales between $\sim$ 0.1-100 pc. We also connect the small-scale fragments to the star-forming potential of the cloud. We combine near-infrared data from the VVV survey with mid-infrared GLIMPSE data to derive a high-resolution dust extinction map and apply a wavelet decomposition technique on it to analyze the fragmentation characteristics of the cloud, which are compared with predictions from fragmentation models. We compare the detected objects to those identified in $\sim$ 10 times coarser resolution from ATLASGAL data. We present a high-resolution extinction map of Nessie. We estimate the mean line-mass of Nessie to be $\sim$ 627 M$\_\odot$/pc and the distance to be $\sim$ 3.5 kpc. We find that Nessie shows fragmentation at multiple size scales. The nearest-neighbour separations of the fragments at all scales are within a factor of 2 of the Jeans' length at that scale. However, the relationship between the mean densities of the fragments and their separations is significantly shallower than expected for Jeans' fragmentation. The relationship is similar to the one predicted for a filament that exhibits a Larson-like scaling between size-scale and velocity dispersion; such a scaling may result from turbulent support. Based on the number of YSOs in Nessie, we estimate that the star formation rate is $\sim$ 371 M$\_\odot$/Myr; similar values result if using the number of dense cores, or the amount of dense gas, as the proxy of star formation. The star formation efficiency is 0.017. These numbers indicate that Nessie's star-forming content is comparable to the Solar neighborhood giant molecular clouds like Orion A.},

At frequencies near 80 MHz where the EDGES experiment has reported 21$\backslash$,cm absorption at $z \approx 17$, absorption could be produced by interstellar nanoparticles with radii $a \approx 50\AA$ in the cold interstellar medium at temperature $T \approx 50$ K. Atmospheric aerosols could contribute additional absorption. The strength of the absorption depends on the abundance of such grains and on their dipole moments, which are uncertain. The breadth of the absorption spectrum of spinning dust limits its possible impact on measurement of a relatively narrow 21 cm absorption feature.},

  abstract      = {We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) absolute proper motion (PM) measurements for 20 globular cluster (GCs) in the Milky Way (MW) halo spanning a Galactocentric distance (R\_GC) range from \~{}10 to 100 kpc. Our median 1d PM uncertainty is 0.06 mas/yr. We derive Galactocentric space velocity vectors of the target GCs by combining our newly-measured PMs with existing line-of-sight velocities. The young and old halo GCs do not show systematic differences in space velocities, but we find a clear dichotomy in the tangential velocity (v\_tan) distribution with Sgr clusters (Arp 2, Pal 12, Terzan 7, and Terzan 8) and NGC 6101 having v\_tan $\gt$ 290 km/s, whereas all other clusters have v\_tan $\lt$ 200 km/s. We confirm the Sgr associations for the four clusters, and rule out associations for NGC 4147, NGC 5024, and NGC 5053 with high confidence. The most distant GC in our sample, NGC 2419 is also most likely associated with the Sgr stream based on our PM results, but with an offset in the transverse direction with respect to the stream path. We derive orbital parameters using the newly measured PMs. We use the distribution of orbital parameters to separate halo GCs that either formed in situ or were accreted, and to assess the specific formation history of e.g. Pyxis and Terzan 8. We constrain the MW mass via a tracer mass estimator that considers the full 6d phase-space information. To represent the full MW halo population from R\_GC = 10 to 40 kpc, we select a subsample of 16 GCs (excluding the distant NGC 2419, and including only one of the four Sgr GCs). The velocity dispersion anisotropy parameter is $\beta$ = 0.609 [+0.130,-0.229]. We estimate the mass within R = 39.5 kpc to be M($\lt$39.5kpc) = 0.60 [+0.17,-0.11] $\times 10^{12} M\_{\odot}$. The implied virial mass is M\_vir=1.87 [+0.67,-0.47] $\times 10^{12} M\_{\odot}$, consistent with, but on the high side among recent mass estimates in the literature.},

  abstract      = {Halometry---mapping out the spectrum, location, and kinematics of nonluminous structures inside the Galactic halo---can be realized via variable weak gravitational lensing of the apparent motions of stars and other luminous background sources. Modern astrometric surveys provide unprecedented positional precision along with a leap in the number of cataloged objects. Astrometry thus offers a new and sensitive probe of collapsed dark matter structures over a wide mass range, from one millionth to several million solar masses. It opens up a window into the spectrum of primordial curvature fluctuations with comoving wavenumbers between $5~\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $10^5~\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, scales hitherto poorly constrained. We outline detection strategies based on three classes of observables---multi-blips, templates, and correlations---that take advantage of correlated effects in the motion of many background light sources that are produced through time-domain gravitational lensing. While existing techniques based on single-source observables such as outliers and mono-blips are best suited for point-like lens targets, our methods offer parametric improvements for extended lens targets such as dark matter subhalos. Multi-blip lensing events may also unveil the existence, location, and mass of planets in the outer reaches of the Solar System, where they would likely have escaped detection by direct imaging.},

  abstract      = {The Gaia mission has detected a large number of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and galaxies, but these objects must be identified among the 1000-fold more numerous stars. Extant astrometric AGN catalogs do not have the uniform sky coverage required to detect and characterize the all-sky low-multipole proper motion signals produced by the barycenter motion, gravitational waves, and cosmological effects. To remedy this, we present an all-sky sample of 567,721 AGN in Gaia Data Release 1, selected using WISE two-color criteria. The catalog has fairly uniform sky coverage beyond the Galactic plane, with a mean density of 12.8 AGN per square degree. The objects have magnitudes ranging from $G=8.8$ down to Gaia's magnitude limit, $G=20.7$. The catalog is approximately 50\% complete but suffers from low stellar contamination, roughly 0.2\%. We predict that the end-of-mission Gaia proper motions for this catalog will enable detection of the secular aberration drift to high significance (23$\sigma$) and will limit the anisotropy of the Hubble expansion to about 2\%.},
