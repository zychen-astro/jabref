  abstract      = {The 1 km$^3$ IcCube neutrino observatory was built to find high-energy neutrinos that are associated with the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Its 5,160 optical sensors detect Cherenkov light from the charged particles produced when neutrinos interact in the ice. In this talk, I will describe the techniques that IceCube has used to search for astrophysical neutrinos. An emphasis will be given to diffuse neutrinos (not associated with a specific source), including analyses of contained events and energetic through-going neutrinos. At the end, I will discuss multi-messenger astronomy, and present an intriguing correlation between a high-energy IceCube neutrino and a blazar in outburst.},
