  abstract      = {Recent radial velocity and transit data discovered $\sim 100$ planets in binary or triple stellar systems out of the entire population of a few thousand known planets. Stellar companions are expected to strongly influence both the formation and the dynamical evolution of planets in multiple star systems. Here, we explore the possibility that planets in triples are formed as a consequence of the dynamical interactions of binaries in star clusters. Our simulations show that the probability of forming triple star systems with a planet is in the range $0.5-3\\%$, potentially accounting for most of the observed population. The recently launched TESS satellite is expected to find a larger sample of planets in triple systems.},

  abstract      = {The initial mass distribution in the solar nebula is a critical input to planet formation models that seek to reproduce today's Solar System$^{ 1 }$. Traditionally, constraints on the gas mass distribution are derived from observations of the dust emission from disks$^{ 2,3 }$, but this approach suffers from large uncertainties in dust opacity and gas-to-dust ratio$^{ 2 }$. On the other hand, previous observations of gas tracers only probe surface layers above the bulk mass reservoir$^{ 4 }$. Here we present the first partially spatially resolved observations of the $^{13}$C$^{18}$O J{\thinsp}={\thinsp}3-2 line emission in the closest protoplanetary disk, TW Hydrae, a gas tracer that probes the bulk mass distribution. Combining it with the C$^{18}$O J{\thinsp}={\thinsp}3-2 emission and the previously detected HD J{\thinsp}={\thinsp}1-0 flux, we directly constrain the mid-plane temperature and optical depths of gas and dust emission. We report a gas mass distribution with radius, R, of     13   - 5   + 8   {\times}   (  R / 20 .5  au  )   -   0.9   - 0.3   + 0.4      {\thinsp}g{\thinsp}cm$^{-2}$ in the expected formation zone of gas and ice giants (5-21 au). We find that the mass ratio of total gas to millimetre-sized dust is 140 in this region, suggesting that at least 2.4M$_{âŠ•}$ of dust aggregates have grown to centimetre sizes (and perhaps much larger). The radial distribution of gas mass is consistent with a self-similar viscous disk profile but much flatter than the posterior extrapolation of mass distribution in our own and extrasolar planetary systems.},

  abstract      = {From the masses of the planets orbiting the Sun, and the abundance of elements relative to hydrogen, it is estimated that when the Solar System formed, the circumstellar disk must have had a minimum mass of around 0.01 solar masses within about 100 astronomical units of the star. (One astronomical unit is the Earth-Sun distance.) The main constituent of the disk, gaseous molecular hydrogen, does not efficiently emit radiation from the disk mass reservoir, and so the most common measure of the disk mass is dust thermal emission and lines of gaseous carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide emission generally indicates properties of the disk surface, and the conversion from dust emission to gas mass requires knowledge of the grain properties and the gas-to-dust mass ratio, which probably differ from their interstellar values. As a result, mass estimates vary by orders of magnitude, as exemplified by the relatively old (3-10 million years) star TW Hydrae, for which the range is 0.0005-0.06 solar masses. Here we report the detection of the fundamental rotational transition of hydrogen deuteride from the direction of TW Hydrae. Hydrogen deuteride is a good tracer of disk gas because it follows the distribution of molecular hydrogen and its emission is sensitive to the total mass. The detection of hydrogen deuteride, combined with existing observations and detailed models, implies a disk mass of more than 0.05 solar masses, which is enough to form a planetary system like our own.},

  abstract      = {CO has long been thought to be the best tracer to measure gas masses as it is readily detected at (sub)mm wavelengths in many disks. Inferred gas masses from CO in recent ALMA observations of large samples of disks seem inconsistent with their inferred dust masses. The derived gas-to-dust mass ratios from CO are 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than $\sim$100 even if photodissociation and freeze-out are included. Herschel measurements of HD line emission imply gas masses in line with gas-to-dust mass ratios of 100. This suggests that at least one additional mechanism is removing gaseous CO. Here we test the suggestion that the bulk of the CO is chemically processed and that the carbon is sequestered into less volatile species such as CO2, CH3OH and CH4 in the dense, shielded midplane regions of the disk. Using our gas-grain chemical code we perform a parameter exploration and follow the CO abundance evolution over a range of conditions representative of shielded disk midplanes. We find that no chemical processing of CO takes place on 1-3 Myr timescales for low cosmic-ray ionisation rates, $\lt 5\times 10^{-18}$ s$^{-1}$. Assuming an ionisation rate of $10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$, more than 90\% of the CO is destroyed, but only in the parts of the disk below 30 K. This order of magnitude destruction of CO is robust against the choice of grain-surface reaction rate parameters except for temperatures below 20 K, where there is a strong dependence on the H tunnelling barrier. The low temperatures needed for CO chemical processing indicate that the exact disk temperature structure is important, with warm disks around luminous Herbig stars expected to have little to no CO conversion. For cold disks around T Tauri stars, a large fraction of the emitting CO layer is affected unless the disks are young ($\lt$ 1 Myr). This can lead to inferred gas masses that are up to two orders of magnitude too low.},

For the most significant detections, the stars' equators rotate approximately twice as fast as their mid-latitudes. The latitudinal shear inferred from asteroseismology is much larger than predictions from numerical simulations.},

  abstract      = {We present the analysis of the planetary microlensing event MOA-2016-BLG-319. The event light curve is characterized by a brief ($\sim 3$ days) anomaly near the peak produced by minor-image perturbations. From modeling, we find two distinct solutions that describe the observed light curve almost equally well. From the investigation of the lens-system configurations, we find that the confusion in the lensing solution is caused by the degeneracy between the two solutions resulting from the source passages on different sides of the planetary caustic. These degeneracies can be severe for major-image perturbations but it is known that they are considerably less severe for minor-image perturbations. From the comparison of the lens-system configuration with those of two previously discovered planetary events, for which similar degeneracies were reported, we find that the degeneracies are caused by the special source trajectories that passed the star-planet axes at approximately right angles. By conducting a Bayesian analysis, it is estimated that the lens is a planetary system in which a giant planet with a mass $M\_{\rm p}=0.62^{+1.16}\_{-0.33}~M\_{\rm J}$ ($0.65^{+1.21}\_{-0.35}~M\_{\rm J}$) is orbiting a low-mass M-dwarf host with a mass $M\_{\rm h}=0.15^{+0.28}\_{-0.08}~M\_\odot$. Here the planet masses in and out of the parentheses represent the masses for the individual degenerate solutions. The projected host-planet separations are $a\_\perp\sim 0.95$ au and $\sim 1.05$ au for the two solutions. The identified degeneracy indicates the need to check similar degeneracies in future analyses of planetary lensing events with minor-image perturbations.},

Our deep, low-dispersion spectroscopy enables monochromatic imaging of Hen3-1475 in UV nebular emission lines, the first of such attempt ever made for a pPN. The high spatial resolution of STIS imaging allows an unprecedentedly sharp view of the S-shaped jet, especially the inner NW1 knot, which is resolved into four components in the MgII 2800 line emission. Through critical comparison with HST optical narrowband images, we found a negative radial velocity gradient in NW1, from -1550 km/s on its innermost component to about -300 km/s on the outermost. Despite their high radial velocities, these components of NW1 mostly show no obvious (or very small) proper motions, indicating that they might be quasi-stationary shocks near the tip of the conical flow along the collimated jet of Hen3-1475.},
