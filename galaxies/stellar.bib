  abstract      = {Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) travel so fast that they may leave the Galaxy. The tidal disruption of a binary system by the supermassive black hole in the Galactic center is widely assumed to be their ejection mechanism. To test the hypothesis of an origin in the Galactic center using kinematic investigations, the current space velocities of the HVSs need to be determined. With the advent of Gaia's second data release, accurate radial velocities from spectroscopy are complemented by proper motion measurements of unprecedented quality. Based on a new spectroscopic analysis method, we provide revised distances and stellar ages, both of which are crucial to unravel the nature of the HVSs. We reanalyzed low-resolution optical spectra of 14 HVSs from the MMT HVS survey using a new grid of synthetic spectra, which account for deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium, to derive effective temperatures, surface gravities, radial velocities, and projected rotational velocities. Stellar masses, radii, and ages were then determined by comparison with stellar evolutionary models that account for rotation. Finally, these results were combined with photometric measurements to obtain spectroscopic distances. The resulting atmospheric parameters are consistent with those of main sequence stars with masses in the range 2.5 - 5.0 $M\_\odot$. The majority of the stars rotate at fast speeds, providing further evidence for their main sequence nature. Stellar ages range from 90 to 400 Myr and distances (with typical $1\sigma$-uncertainties of about 10-15\%) from 30 to 100 kpc. Except for one object (B711), which we reclassify as A-type star, all stars are of spectral type B. The spectroscopic distances and stellar ages derived here are key ingredients for upcoming kinematic studies of HVSs based on Gaia proper motions.},

  title       = {Recent progress in high-mass star-formation studies with ALMA},
  abstract    = {Formation processes of high-mass stars have been long-standing issues in astronomy and astrophysics. This is mainly because of major difficulties in observational studies such as a smaller number of high-mass young stellar objects (YSOs), larger distances, and more complex structures in young high-mass clusters compared with nearby low-mass isolated star-forming regions (SFRs), and extremely large opacity of interstellar dust except for centimeter to submillimeter wavelengths. High resolution and high sensitivity observations with Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) at millimeter/submillimeter wavelengths will overcome these observational difficulties even for statistical studies with increasing number of high-mass YSO samples. This review will summarize recent progresses in high-mass star-formation studies with ALMA such as clumps and filaments in giant molecular cloud complexes and infrared dark clouds (IRDCs), protostellar disks and outflows in dense cores, chemistry, masers, and accretion bursts in high-mass SFRs.},

Old globular clusters keep imprints of the physical conditions of their assembly in the early Universe, and younger stellar objects, observationally resolved, tell us about the mechanisms at stake in their formation. Yet, we still do not understand the diversity involved: why is star cluster formation limited to 10$^{5}$M$_{⊙}$ objects in the Milky Way, while some dwarf galaxies like NGC 1705 are able to produce clusters 10 times more massive? Why do dwarfs generally host a higher specific frequency of clusters than larger galaxies? How to connect the present-day, often resolved, stellar systems to the formation of globular clusters at high redshift? And how do these links depend on the galactic and cosmological environments of these clusters? In this review, I present recent advances on star cluster formation and evolution, in galactic and cosmological context. The emphasis is put on the theory, formation scenarios and the effects of the environment on the evolution of the global properties of clusters. A few open questions are identified.},

  abstract      = {The origin of dust in the early Universe has been the subject of considerable debate. Core-collapse supernovae (ccSNe), which occur several million years after their massive progenitors form, could be a major source of that dust, as in the local universe several ccSNe have been observed to be copious dust producers. Here we report nine near-infrared (0.8 - 2.5 micron) spectra of the Type II-P SN 2017eaw in NGC 6946, spanning the time interval 22 - 205 days after discovery. The specta show the onset of CO formation and continuum emission at wavelengths greater than 2.1 micron from newly-formed hot dust, in addition to numerous lines of hydrogen and metals, which reveal the change in ionization as the density of much of the ejecta decreases. The observed CO masses estimated from an LTE model are typically 10\^{}$\{$-4$\}$ Msun during days 124 - 205, but could be an order of magnitude larger if non-LTE conditions are present in the emitting region. The timing of the appearance of CO is remarkably consistent with chemically controlled dust models of Sarangi {\amp} Cherchneff.},

  abstract      = {As part of the ESO-VLT Multi-Instrument Kinematic Survey (MIKiS) of Galactic globular clusters, we present a detailed investigation of the internal kinematics of NGC 5986. The analysis is based on about 300 individual radial velocities of stars located at various distances from the cluster center, up to 300 arcseconds (about 4 half-mass radii). Our analysis reveals the presence of a solid-body rotation extending from the cluster center to the outermost regions probed by the data, and a velocity dispersion profile initially declining with the distance from the cluster's center, but flattening and staying constant at \~{}5 km/s for distances larger than about one half-mass radius. This is the first globular cluster for which evidence of the joint presence of solid-body rotation and flattening in the outer velocity dispersion profile is found. The combination of these two kinematical features provides a unique opportunity to shed light on fundamental aspects of globular cluster dynamics and probe the extent to which internal relaxation, star escape, angular momentum transport and loss, and the interaction with the Galaxy tidal field can affect a cluster's dynamical evolution and determine its current kinematical properties. We present the results of a series of N-body simulations illustrating the possible dynamical paths leading to kinematic features like those observed in this cluster and the fundamental dynamical processes that underpin them.},

Based on our VLBA astrometry, we obtain a distance of 321+/-10 pc for IC 348. This is fully consistent with the mean distance of 320+/-26 measured by Gaia. The VLBA observations toward NGC 1333 are insufficient to claim a successful distance measurement to this cluster. Gaia parallaxes, on the other hand, yield a mean distance of 293+/-22 pc. Hence, the distance along the line of sight between the eastern and western edges of the cloud is ~30 pc, which is significantly smaller than previously inferred. We use Gaia proper motions and published radial velocities to derive the spatial velocities of a selected sample of stars. The average velocity vectors with respect to the LSR are (u,v,w) = (-6.1+/-1.6, 6.8+/-1.1, -0.9+/-1.2) and (-6.4+/-1.0, 2.1+/-1.4, -2.4+/-1.0) km/s for IC 348 and NGC 1333, respectively. Finally, our analysis of the kinematics of the stars has shown that there is no clear evidence of expansion, contraction, or rotational motions within the clusters.},

Because of the known distance, 50 kpc, the SNRs' angular sizes can be converted to linear sizes, and their X-ray observations can be used to assess X-ray luminosities ($L\_X$). We have critically examined the LMC SNRs' sizes reported in the literature to determine the most plausible sizes. These sizes and the $L\_X$ determined from $\backslash$emph$\{$XMM-Newton$\}$ observations are used to investigate their relationship in order to explore the environmental and evolutionary effects on the X-ray properties of SNRs. We find: (1) Small LMC SNRs, a few to 10 pc in size, are all of Type Ia with $L\_X\gt10^{36}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. The scarcity of small core-collapse (CC) SNRs is a result of CCSNe exploding in the low-density interiors of interstellar bubbles blown by their massive progenitors during their main sequence phase. (2) Medium-sized (10-30 pc) CC SNRs show bifurcation in $L\_X$, with the X-ray-bright SNRs either in an environment associated with molecular clouds or containing pulsars and pulsar wind nebulae and the X-ray-faint SNRs being located in low-density interstellar environments. (3) Large (size$\gt$30 pc) SNRs show a trend of $L\_X$ fading with size, although the scatter is large. The observed relationship between $L\_X$ and sizes can help constrain models of SNR evolution.},

We present the discovery of two new GCs located close to the Galactic plane in the sky. These two GCs, RLGC 1 and RLGC 2, were discovered serendipitously during our new cluster survey (Ryu {\amp} Lee 2018) based on near-Infrared and mid-Infrared survey data. The two GCs show a grouping of resolved stars in their $K$ band images and a presence of faint diffuse light in their outer regions in the WISE $W1$ band images. They also show prominent red giant branches (RGBs) in their $K$ vs. $(J-K)$ color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). We determine structural parameters of the two GCs using King profile fitting on their $K$ band radial number density profiles. The determined values are consistent with those of known GCs. Finally, we determine the distances, metallicities, and reddenings of the two GCs using the isochrone fitting on their CMDs. For the fitting, we assume that the ages of the two GCs are 12.6 Gyr and the brightest RGB stars of each cluster correspond to the tip of the RGB. Distances and metallicities of the two GCs are estimated to be $d=28.8\pm4.3$ kpc and $\textrm{[Fe/H]}=-2.2\pm0.2$ for RLGC 1 and $d=15.8\pm2.4$ kpc and $\textrm{[Fe/H]}=-2.1\pm0.3$ for RLGC 2. These results show that the two GCs are located at the far-half region of the Milky Way and they may belong to the halo of the Milky Way.},

  abstract      = {Globular clusters (GCs) in the Milky Way exhibit a well-observed bimodal distribution in core radii separating the so-called ``core-collapsed'' and ``non-core-collapsed'' clusters. Here, we use our H$\backslash$'enon-type Monte Carlo code, CMC, to explore initial cluster parameters that map into this bimodality. Remarkably, we find that by varying the initial size of clusters (specified in our initial conditions in terms of the initial virial radius, $r\_v$) within a relatively narrow range consistent with the measured radii of young star clusters in the local universe ($r\_v \approx 0.5-5$ pc), our models reproduce the variety of present-day cluster properties. Furthermore, we show that stellar-mass black holes (BHs) play an intimate role in this mapping from initial conditions to the present-day structural features of GCs. We identify ``best-fit'' models for three GCs with known observed BH candidates, NGC 3201, M22, and M10, and show that these clusters harbor populations of $\sim 50-100$ stellar-mass BHs at present. As an alternative case, we also compare our models to the core-collapsed cluster NGC 6752 and show that this cluster likely contains few BHs at present. Additionally, we explore the formation of BH binaries in GCs and demonstrate that these systems form naturally in our models in both detached and mass-transferring configurations with a variety of companion stellar types, including low-mass main sequence stars, white dwarfs, and sub-subgiants.},

They are thought to derive from normal main-sequence stars that have undergone a recent increase in mass. Statistical evidence indicates that in globular star clusters the blue stragglers probably form from binary stars. The specific formation processes, such as mass transfer, mergers or stellar collisions during dynamical encounters of binary stars, remain unresolved. Here we report that 16 of the 21 blue stragglers (76 per cent) in the old (7-Gyr; ref. 2) open cluster NGC188 are currently in binary systems, a frequency three times that found among normal solar-type main-sequence stars. These blue straggler binaries have a remarkable period-eccentricity distribution, with all but three having orbital periods of \~{}1,000days. Moreover, these stars are rotating faster than normal main-sequence stars of the same surface temperatures. These data show that most, and possibly all, blue stragglers derive from multiple-star systems, and indicate that the several formation processes operate simultaneously. We suggest that rapid rotation of blue stragglers may place upper limits on their ages.},

  abstract      = {Binary and multiple star systems are a frequent outcome of the star formation process and as a result almost half of all stars with masses similar to that of the Sun have at least one companion star. Theoretical studies indicate that there are two main pathways that can operate concurrently to form binary/multiple star systems: large-scale fragmentation of turbulent gas cores and filaments or smaller-scale fragmentation of a massive protostellar disk due to gravitational instability. Observational evidence for turbulent fragmentation on scales of more than 1,000 astronomical units has recently emerged. Previous evidence for disk fragmentation was limited to inferences based on the separations of more-evolved pre-main sequence and protostellar multiple systems. The triple protostar system L1448 IRS3B is an ideal system with which to search for evidence of disk fragmentation as it is in an early phase of the star formation process, it is likely to be less than 150,000 years old and all of the protostars in the system are separated by less than 200 astronomical units. Here we report observations of dust and molecular gas emission that reveal a disk with a spiral structure surrounding the three protostars. Two protostars near the centre of the disk are separated by 61 astronomical units and a tertiary protostar is coincident with a spiral arm in the outer disk at a separation of 183 astronomical units. The inferred mass of the central pair of protostellar objects is approximately one solar mass, while the disk surrounding the three protostars has a total mass of around 0.30 solar masses. The tertiary protostar itself has a minimum mass of about 0.085 solar masses. We demonstrate that the disk around L1448 IRS3B appears susceptible to disk fragmentation at radii between 150 and 320 astronomical units, overlapping with the location of the tertiary protostar. This is consistent with models for a protostellar disk that has recently undergone gravitational instability, spawning one or two companion stars.},

Although early surveys showed that the observed spectroscopic binary (SB) fractions in the galactic disk and halo are similar (e.g., Carney-Latham sample), these studies did not correct for incompleteness. In this study, we examine five different surveys and thoroughly account for their underlying selection biases to measure the intrinsic occurrence rate of close solar-type binaries. We re-analyze: (1) a volume-limited sample of solar-type stars, (2) an SB survey of high-proper-motion stars, (3) various SB samples of metal-poor giants, (4) the APOGEE survey of radial velocity (RV) variables, and (5) Kepler eclipsing binaries (EBs). The observed APOGEE RV variability fraction and Kepler EB fraction both decrease by a factor of $\approx$4 across $-$1.0 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ 0.5 at the 22$\sigma$ and 9$\sigma$ confidence levels, respectively. After correcting for incompleteness, all five samples exhibit a quantitatively consistent anti-correlation between the intrinsic close binary fraction (a $\lt$ 10 AU) and metallicity: $F\_{\rm close}$ = 53\%$\pm$12\%, 40\%$\pm$6\%, 24\%$\pm$4\%, and 10\%$\pm$3\% at [Fe/H] = $-$3.0, $-$1.0, $-$0.2 (mean field metallicity), and +0.5, respectively. We present fragmentation models that explain why the close binary fraction of solar-type stars strongly decreases with metallicity while the wide binary fraction, close binary fraction of OB stars, and initial mass function are all constant across $-$1.5 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ 0.5. The majority of solar-type stars with [Fe/H] $\lt$ $-$1.0 will interact with a stellar companion, which has profound implications for binary evolution in old and metal-poor environments such as the galactic halo, bulge, thick disk, globular clusters, dwarf galaxies, and high-redshift universe.},

  abstract      = {Although the globular clusters in the Milky Way have been studied for a long time, a significant fraction of them lack homogeneous metallicity and radial velocity measurements. In an earlier paper we presented the first part of a project to obtain metallicities and radial velocities of Galactic globular clusters from multiobject spectroscopy of their member stars using the ESO Very Large Telescope. In this paper we add metallicities and radial velocities for a new sample of 28 globular clusters, including in particular globular clusters in the MW halo and the Galactic bulge. Together with our previous results, this study brings the number of globular clusters with homogeneous measurements to $\sim 69$ $\backslash$\% of those listed in the W. Harris' catalogue. As in our previous work, we have used the CaII triplet lines to derive metallicities and radial velocities. For most of the clusters in this study, this is the first analysis based on spectroscopy of individual member stars. The metallicities derived from the CaII triplet are then compared to the results of our parallel study based on spectral fitting in the optical region and the implications for different calibrations of the CaII triplet line strengths are discussed. We also comment on some interesting clusters and investigate the presence of an abundance spread in the globular clusters here. A hint of a possible intrinsic spread is found for NGC 6256, which therefore appears to be a good candidate for further study.},

  abstract      = {We investigate the nature of nearby (10-15 kpc) high-speed stars in the Gaia DR2 archive identified on the basis of parallax, proper motion and radial velocity. Together with a consideration of their kinematic, orbital, and photometric properties, we develop a novel strategy for evaluating whether high speed stars are statistical outliers of the bound population or unbound stars capable of escaping the Galaxy. Out of roughly 1.5 million stars with radial velocities, proper motions, and 5-sigma parallaxes, we identify just over 100 high-speed stars. Of these, only two have a nearly 100\% chance of being unbound, with indication that they are not just bound outliers; both are likely hyper-runaway stars. The rest of the high speed stars are likely statistical outliers. We use the sample of high-speed stars to demonstrate that radial velocity alone provides a poor discriminant of nearby, unbound stars. However, nearby, unbound stars are efficiently identified from the tangential velocity, using just parallax and proper motion. Within the full Gaia DR2 archive of stars with 5-sigma parallax and proper motion but no radial velocity, we identify a sample of 19 with speeds significantly larger than the local escape speed of the Milky Way based on tangential motion alone.},

Here we apply spherically symmetric SNR evolution models to these 15 remnants to obtain estimates for ages, explosion energies, circum-stellar medium densities and profiles (uniform or wind-type).From the distribution of ages we obtain a supernova birth rate and estimate incompleteness. The energies and densities can be well fit with log-normal distributions. The distribution of explosion energies is very similar to that of SNRs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), suggesting SN explosions in the LMC and in the Galaxy are very similar. The density distribution has higher mean density for Galactic SNRs than for LMC SNRs, by a factor $\sim$2.5.},

  abstract      = {We present an analysis of the impact of spiral density waves (DWs) on the radial and surface density distributions of supernovae (SNe) in host galaxies with different arm classes. We use a well-defined sample of 269 relatively nearby, low-inclination, morphologically non-disturbed and unbarred Sa-Sc galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, hosting 333 SNe. Only for core-collapse (CC) SNe, a significant difference appears when comparing their R25-normalized radial distributions in long-armed grand-design (LGD) versus non-GD (NGD) hosts, with that in LGD galaxies being marginally inconsistent with an exponential profile, while SNe Ia exhibit exponential surface density profiles regardless of the arm class. Using a smaller sample of LGD galaxies with estimated corotation radii (Rc), we show that the Rc-normalized surface density distribution of CC SNe indicates a dip at corotation. Although not statistically significant, the high CC SNe surface density just inside and outside corotation may be the sign of triggered massive star formation by the DWs. Our results may, if confirmed with larger samples, support the large-scale shock scenario induced by spiral DWs in LGD galaxies, which predicts a higher star formation efficiency around the shock fronts, avoiding the corotation region.},

  abstract      = {Galactic globular clusters (GCs) show overwhelming photometric and spectroscopic evidence for the existence of multiple stellar populations. The question of whether or not there exists a GC that represents a true 'simple stellar population' remains open. Here we focus on Ruprecht 106 (R106), a halo GC with [Fe/H]=-1.5 and [alpha/Fe]\~{}0. A previous spectroscopic study found no sign of the Na-O anticorrelation among 9 of its brightest red giants, which led to the conclusion that R106 is a true simple stellar population GC. Here we present new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 photometry of R106 that, when combined with archival HST images spanning a 6-year baseline, allows us to create proper motion cleaned color-magnitude diagrams spanning the ultraviolet (F336W) to the near-infrared (F814W). These data allow us to construct the pseudo-color C\_$\{$U,B,I$\}$ that is sensitive to the presence of light-element abundance spreads. We find no evidence of a split along the red giant branch (RGB) in the C\_$\{$U,B,I$\}$ diagram but the width of the RGB (sigma\_CUBI = 0.015) is marginally broader than expected from artificial star tests (sigma\_CUBI = 0.009). The observed spread in C\_$\{$U,B,I$\}$ is smaller than any other Galactic GC studied to date. Our results raise important questions about the role of formation environment and primordial chemical composition in the formation of multiple stellar populations in GCs.},

The derived trend of gradient $\Delta[M/H]/\Delta R\_g$ versus [Mg/Fe] shows a transition at [Mg/Fe] $\sim 0.18$ dex, below which the gradient is negative and varies a little as [Mg/Fe] increases; however, it changes sharply in [Mg/Fe] ranges of 0.16-0.18, above which the gradient increases linearly with increasing [Mg/Fe], being a positive value at [Mg/Fe]$\gtrsim 0.22$ dex. These positive gradients in the high-[Mg/Fe] populations are found at $|Z| \lt 0.8$ kpc, and there are nearly no gradients toward higher $|Z|$. By comparing the metallicity distributions, the radial metallicity gradients $\Delta[M/H]/\Delta R$ and the metallicity-rotation gradients between the total sample and $|R-R\_g|\lt2$ kpc subsample (or $|R-R\_g|\gt2$ kpc subsample), we find that, for the thick disk, blurring flattens the gradient $\Delta[M/H]/\Delta R$ and favors metal-poor high-eccentricity stars. These stars are responsible for the measured positive metallicity-rotation gradient of the thick disk.},

  abstract      = {We investigate the dynamical evolution of star clusters during their formation, assuming that they are born from a turbulent starless clump of a given mass that is embedded within a parent self-gravitating molecular cloud characterized by a particular mass surface density. In contrast to the standard practice of most $N$-body studies, we do not assume that all stars are formed at once. Rather, we explore the effects of different star formation rates on the global structure and evolution of young embedded star clusters, also considering various primordial binary fractions and mass segregation levels. Our fiducial clumps studied in this paper have initial masses of $M\_{\rm cl} = 3000\,M\_\odot$, are embedded in ambient cloud environments of $\Sigma\_{\rm cloud} = 0.1$ and 1 g cm$^{-2}$, and gradually form stars with an overall efficiency of 50\% until the gas is exhausted. We investigate star formation efficiencies per free-fall time in the range $\epsilon\_{\rm ff}=0.01$ to 1, and also compare to the instantaneous case ($\epsilon\_{\rm ff}=\infty$) of Paper I. We show that most of the interesting dynamical processes that determine the future of the cluster, happen during the early formation phase. In particular, the ejected stellar population is sensitive to the duration of star cluster formation: for example, clusters with longer formation times produce more runaway stars, since these clusters remain in a dense state for longer, thus favouring occurrence of dynamical ejections. We also show that the presence of radial age gradients in star clusters depends sensitively on the star formation efficiency per free fall time, with observed values being matched best by our slowest forming clusters with $\epsilon\_{\rm ff}\lesssim0.03$.},

  abstract      = {Very young star clusters in the Milky Way exhibit a well-defined relation between their maximum stellar mass, m\_max, and their mass in stars, M\_ecl. A recent study shows that the young intermediate-mass star cluster VVV CL041 possibly hosts a $\gt$80 Msun star, WR62-2, which appears to violate the existence of the m\_max-M\_ecl relation since the mass of the star is almost two times higher than that expected from the relation. By performing direct N-body calculations with the same mass as the cluster VVV CL041 (3000 Msun), we study whether such a very massive star can be formed via dynamically induced stellar collisions in a binary-rich star cluster that initially follows the m\_max-M\_ecl relation. Eight out of 100 clusters form a star more massive than 80 Msun through multiple stellar collisions. This suggests that the VVV CL041 cluster may have become an outlier of the relation because of its early-dynamical evolution, even if the cluster followed the relation at birth. We find that more than half of our model clusters host a merger product as its most massive member within the first 5 Myr of cluster evolution. Thus, the existence of stars more massive than the m\_max-M\_ecl relation in some young clusters is expected due to dynamical processes despite the validity of the m\_max-M\_ecl relation. We briefly discuss evolution of binary populations in our model.},

The abundances of light elements in stellar atmospheres depends on the initial rotation velocity, so the typical rotation velocities of young Main Sequence (MS) stars are examined. Since the data on the adundances of light elements in stars are very extensive, the main emphasis in this review is on several unsolved problems.},

They trace obscuring dust in the inner regions of the associated nebulosity. The dust forms two cocoons, each extending \~{}5 arcsec north and south of the presumed location of the central star. Brighter emission is in a more compact east-west structure (2 arcsec by 1 arcsec) where the cocoons intersect. We detect line emission in NH$\_2$CHO, CN, four organic molecules and C$^{17}$O. CN lines trace bubbles within the dusty cocoons; CH$\_3$OH a north-south S-shaped jet; and other molecules a central cloud with a structure aligned with the innermost dust structure. The major axis of the overall dust and gas bubble structure has a projected inclination of \~{}24 degrees with respect to a 71 arcsec extended ``hourglass'' nebulosity, previously seen in H alpha. Three cocoon limbs align with dark lanes in the inner regions of the same H alpha images. The central 2 arcsec by 1 arcsec dust is resolved into a structure consistent with a warped dusty disc. The velocity structure of the jets indicates an origin at the centre of this disc and precession with an unknown period. Deceleration regions at both the northern and southern tips of the jets are roughly coincident with additional diffuse dust emission over regions approximately 2 arcsec across. These structures are consistent with a bipolar outflow expanding into surrounding high density material. We suggest that a white dwarf and brown dwarf merged between 1670 and 1672, with the observed structures and extraordinary isotopic abundances generated as a result.},

Both objects are barely visible across infrared (IR, i.e., near-IR to far-IR) bands. The physical nature of the cores is very similar to that expected in first hydrostatic cores (FHSCs), objects theoretically predicted in the evolutionary phase prior to stellar core formation with gas densities of $\sim$ 10$^{11-12}$ cm$^{-3}$. This suggests that the evolutionary stage is close to the FHSC formation phase. The two objects are associated with faint X-ray sources, suggesting that they are in very early phase of stellar core formation with magnetic activity. In addition, we found the CO outflow components around both sources which may originate from the young outflows driven by these sources. The masses of these objects are calculated to be $\sim 0.01-0.03$ $M\_\odot$ from the dust continuum emission. Their physical properties are consistent with that expected from the numerical model of forming brown dwarfs. These facts (the X-ray detection, CO outflow association, and FHSC-like spectral energy distributions) strongly indicate that the two objects are proto-BDs or will be in the very early phase of protostars which will evolve more massive protostars if they gain enough mass from the surroundings. The ages of these two objects are likely to be within $\sim 10^3$ years after the protostellar core (or second core) formation, taking into account the outflow dynamical times ($\lesssim$ 500 yrs).},
