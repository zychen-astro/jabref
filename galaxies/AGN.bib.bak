  title       = {The WISSH QSOs project V. ALMA reveals the cradle of a giant galaxy around a z=4.4 hyper-luminous QSO},
  abstract    = {We present an ALMA high-resolution observation of the 840 um continuum and [CII] line emission in the WISE-SDSS selected hyper-luminous (WISSH) QSO J1015+0020 at z~4.4.We reveal an exceptional overdensity of [CII]-emitting companions with a very small (<150 km/s) velocity shift with respect to the QSO redshift. We report the discovery of the closest companion observed so far in sub-mm observations of high-z QSOs, distant only 2.2 kpc and merging with J1015+0020, while two other [CII] emitters are found at 8 and 17 kpc. Two strong continuum emitters are also detected at <3.5 arcsec. They are likely associated to the same overdense structure of J1015+0020, as they exceed by a factor of 100 the number of expected sources, considering the Log(N)-Log(S) at 850 um. The host galaxy of J1015+0020 shows a SFR of about 100 Msun/yr while the total SFR of the QSO and its companion galaxies is a factor of 10 higher, indicating that substantial stellar mass assembly at early epochs may have taken place in the QSO satellites. For J1015+0020 we compute a SMBH mass MBH~6E9 Msun and a dynamical mass Mdyn~4E10 Msun . This translates into an extreme ratio Mdyn/MBH~7. The total stellar mass of the QSO host galaxy plus the [CII] emitters already exceeds 1E11 Msun at z~4.4. They will likely merge and develop into a giant galaxy of 1.3E12 Msun. By comparing the black hole accretion rate and the SFR, and assuming that local relations between the mass outflow rate and the QSO bolometric luminosity hold at the observed redshift, we conclude that J1015+0020 is potentially able to drive a massive molecular outflow affecting the SFR in the QSO host galaxy, similarly to what observed for 47 QSOs at z>4.5. Under the assumption of constant mass or Eddington accretion rate equal to the observed ones, we find that the growth timescale of the host galaxy is comparable or even shorter than the one inferred for the SMBH.},

  title       = {Eclipsing damped Ly$α$ systems in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 12},
  abstract    = {We present the results of our automatic search for proximate damped Ly$\alpha$ absorption (PDLA) systems in the quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 12. We constrain our search to those PDLAs lying within 1500 km s$^{-1}$ from the quasar to make sure that the broad DLA absorption trough masks most of the strong Ly$\alpha$ emission from the broad line region (BLR) of the quasar. When the Ly$\alpha$ emission from the BLR is blocked by these so-called eclipsing DLAs, narrow Ly$\alpha$ emission from the host galaxy could be revealed as a narrow emission line (NEL) in the DLA trough. We define a statistical sample of 399 eclipsing DLAs with log$N$(HI)$\ge$21.10. We divide our statistical sample into three subsamples based on the strength of the NEL detected in the DLA trough. By studying the stacked spectra of these subsamples, we found that absorption from high ionization species are stronger in DLAs with stronger NEL in their absorption core. Moreover, absorption from the excited states of species like SiII are also stronger in DLAs with stronger NEL. We also found no correlation between the luminosity of the Ly$\alpha$ NEL and the quasar luminosity. These observations are consistent with a scenario in which the DLAs with stronger NEL are denser and physically closer to the quasar. We propose that these eclipsing DLAs could be the product of the interaction between infalling and outflowing gas. High resolution spectroscopic observation would be needed to shed some light on the nature of these eclipsing DLAs.},

Here we report the discovery and present the spectroscopic observations of a quasar, KV-RQ$\backslash$,1500-0031, at $z=2.520$ reddened by a likely dusty DLA at $z=2.428$ and a strong MgII absorber at $z=1.603$. This quasar was identified as part of the KiDS-VIKING Red Quasar (KV-RQ) survey, specifically aimed at targeting dusty absorbers which may cause the background quasars to escape the optical selection of e.g. the SDSS quasar survey. For the DLA we find an HI column density of $\log N$(HI) = $21.2\pm 0.1$ and a metallicity of [X/H] = $-0.90\pm 0.20$ derived from an empirical relation based on the equivalent width of SiII$\lambda$1526. We observe a total visual extinction of $A\_V=0.16$ mag induced by both absorbers. We compile a sample of 17 additional dusty ($A\_V \gt 0.1$ mag) DLAs toward quasars (QSO-DLAs) from the literature for which we characterize the properties of HI column density, metallicity and dust. From this sample we also estimate a correction factor to the overall DLA metallicity budget. We demonstrate that the dusty QSO-DLAs have high metal column densities ($\log N$(HI) + [X/H]) and are more similar to gamma-ray burst (GRB)-selected DLAs (GRB-DLAs) than regular QSO-DLAs. We evaluate the effect of dust reddening in DLAs as well as illustrate how the induced color excess of the underlying quasars can be significant (up to $\sim 1$ mag in various optical bands), even for low to moderate extinction values ($A\_V \lesssim 0.6$ mag). Finally we discuss the direct and indirect implications of a significant dust bias in both QSO- and GRB-DLA samples. [Abridged]},

Here we report observations of a quasar (ULASJ112001.48+064124.3) at a redshift of 7.085, which is 0.77 billion years after the Big Bang. ULASJ1120+0641 has a luminosity of 6.3{\times}10$^{13}$L$_{solar}$ and hosts a black hole with a mass of 2{\times}10$^{9}$M$_{solar}$ (where L$_{solar}$ and M$_{solar}$ are the luminosity and mass of the Sun). The measured radius of the ionized near zone around ULASJ1120+0641 is 1.9megaparsecs, a factor of three smaller than is typical for quasars at redshifts between 6.0 and 6.4. The near-zone transmission profile is consistent with a Ly{$\alpha$} damping wing, suggesting that the neutral fraction of the intergalactic medium in front of ULASJ1120+0641 exceeded 0.1.},

The existence of such black holes when the Universe was less than one billion years old presents substantial challenges to theories of the formation and growth of black holes and the coevolution of black holes and galaxies. Here we report the discovery of an ultraluminous quasar, SDSS J010013.02+280225.8, at redshift z = 6.30. It has an optical and near-infrared luminosity a few times greater than those of previously known z $\gt$ 6 quasars. On the basis of the deep absorption trough on the blue side of the Lyman-{$\alpha$} emission line in the spectrum, we estimate the proper size of the ionized proximity zone associated with the quasar to be about 26 million light years, larger than found with other z $\gt$ 6.1 quasars with lower luminosities. We estimate (on the basis of a near-infrared spectrum) that the black hole has a mass of \~{}1.2 {\times} 10$^{10}$ , which is consistent with the 1.3 {\times} 10$^{10}$  derived by assuming an Eddington-limited accretion rate.},

We measure the nonparametric morphological parameters (the asymmetry index A, the Gini coefficient G, the concentration index C, and the M $_{20}$ index) based on point-source-subtracted images. All the distributions of these morphological parameters of AGN hosts are consistent with those of the control sample. We finally investigate the fraction of distorted morphologies in both samples by visual classification. Only \~{}15\% of the AGN hosts have highly distorted morphologies, possibly due to a major merger or interaction. We find there is no significant difference in the distortion fractions between the AGN host sample and control sample.

On average, AGN1s show soft X-ray spectra, consistent with being unabsorbed, while AGN2s and SFs show hard X-ray spectra, consistent with being absorbed. The analysis of the average SEDs as a function of X-ray luminosity shows a reddening of the infrared SEDs, consistent with a decreasing contribution from the host galaxy at higher luminosities. The AGNs in the SF classes are likely obscured in the mid-infrared, as suggested by their low L 3-20 μm / L ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/663/1/81/img4.gif] {img4.gif} ratios.

The X-ray-radio correlation can be used to identify heavily absorbed AGNs.

  abstract      = {In hierarchical models of galaxy formation, stellar tidal streams are expected around most, if not all, galaxies. Although these features may provide useful diagnostics of the $\Lambda$CDM model, their observational properties remain poorly constrained because they are challenging to detect and interpret and have been studied in detail for only a sparse sampling of galaxy population. More quantitative, systematic approaches are required. We advocate statistical analysis of the counts and properties of such features in archival wide-field imaging surveys for a direct comparison against results from numerical simulations. Thus, in this paper we aim to study systematically the frequency of occurrence and other observational properties of tidal features around nearby galaxies. The sample we construct will act as a foundational dataset for statistical comparison with cosmological models of galaxy formation. Our approach is based on a visual classification of diffuse features around a volume-limited sample of nearby galaxies, using a post-processing of Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging optimized for the detection of stellar structure with low surface brightness. At a limiting surface brightness of $28\ \mathrm{mag~arcsec^{-2}}$, 14\% of the galaxies in our sample exhibit evidence of diffuse features likely to have arisen from minor merging events. Our technique recovers all previously known streams in our sample and yields a number of new candidates. Consistent with previous studies, coherent arc-like features and shells are the most common type of tidal structures found in this study. We conclude that although some detections are ambiguous and could be corroborated or refuted with deeper imaging, our technique provides a reliable foundation for the statistical analysis of diffuse circumgalactic features in wide-area imaging surveys, and for the identification of targets for follow-up studies.},

  abstract    = {After the tidal disruption of a star by a massive black hole, disrupted stellar debris can fall back to the hole at a rate significantly exceeding its Eddington limit. To understand how black hole mass affects the duration of super-Eddington accretion in tidal disruption events, we first run a suite of simulations of the disruption of a Solar-like star by a supermassive black hole of varying mass to directly measure the fallback rate onto the hole, and we compare these fallback rates to the analytic predictions of the "frozen-in" model. Then, adopting a Zero-Bernoulli Accretion flow as an analytic prescription for the accretion flow around the hole, we investigate how the accretion rate onto the black hole evolves with the more accurate fallback rates calculated from the simulations. We find that numerically-simulated fallback rates yield accretion rates onto the hole that can, depending on the black hole mass, be nearly an order of magnitude larger than those predicted by the frozen-in approximation. Our results place new limits on the maximum black hole mass for which super-Eddington accretion occurs in tidal disruption events.},

  title       = {Chandra Survey of Nearby Galaxies: Testing the Accretion Model for Low-luminosity AGNs},
  abstract    = {From a Chandra sample of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in nearby galaxies, we find that for low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs), either the intrinsic absorption column density, or the fraction of absorbed AGNs, positively scales with the Eddington ratio for $L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd} \lesssim 10^{-2}$. Such a behavior, along with the softness of the X-ray spectrum at low luminosities, is in good agreement with the picture that they are powered by hot accretion flows surrounding supermassive black holes. Numerical simulations find that outflows are inevitable with hot accretion flows, and the outflow rate is correlated with the innermost accretion rate in the low-luminosity regime. This agrees well with our results, suggesting that the X-ray absorption originates from or is associated with the outflow material. Gas and dust on larger scales may also produce the observed correlation. Future correlation analysis may help differentiate the two scenarios.},

  title       = {The Black Hole Masses and Eddington Ratios of Type 2 Quasars},
  abstract    = {Type 2 quasars are an important constituent of active galaxies, possibly representing the evolutionary precursors of traditionally studied type 1 quasars. We characterize the black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) and Eddington ratio ($L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd}$) for 669 type 2 quasars selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, using black hole masses estimated from the $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma_{\ast}$ relation and bolometric corrections scaled from the extinction-corrected $ [\rm O~{\scriptsize III}]~ \lambda 5007$ luminosity. When stellar velocity dispersions cannot be measured directly from the spectra, we estimate them from the core velocity dispersions of the narrow emission lines $ \rm [O~{\scriptsize II}]~ \lambda\lambda 3726, 3729$, $ \rm [S~{\scriptsize II}]~\lambda\lambda 6716, 6731$, and $[ \rm O~{\scriptsize III}]~ \lambda 5007$, which are shown to trace the gravitational potential of the stars. Energy input from the active nucleus still imparts significant perturbations to the gas kinematics, especially to high-velocity, blueshifted wings. Nonvirial motions in the gas become most noticeable in systems with high Eddington ratios. The black hole masses of our sample of type 2 quasars range from $M_{\rm BH} \approx 10^{6.5} $ to $10^{10.4} \, M_\odot$ (median $10^{8.2} \, M_\odot$). Type 2 quasars have characteristically large Eddington ratios ($L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd}~\approx 10^{-2.9}-10^{1.8}$; median $10^{-0.7}$), slightly higher than in type~1 quasars of similar redshift; the luminosities of $\sim$20% of the sample formally exceed the Eddington limit. The high Eddington ratios may be consistent with the notion that obscured quasars evolve into unobscured quasars.},

The galaxies are located at relatively low redshifts, $z\sim$0.3, with morphologies ranging from extended and disturbed to compact and smooth. To complement the HST observations we also analyze observations taken with the VIMOS spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). In our galaxy sample we identify three objects with double peak Lyman-$\alpha$ profiles similar to those seen in Green Pea compact galaxies and measure peak separations of 655, 374, and 275 km s$^{-1}$. We measure Lyman-$\alpha$ escape fractions with values ranging between 5-13\%. Given the low flux levels in the individual COS exposures we apply a weighted stacking approach to obtain a single spectrum. From this COS combined spectrum we infer upper limits for the absolute and relative Lyman continuum escape fractions of $f_{\rm abs}(\rm LyC)$ = 0.4$^{+10.1}_{-0.4}$\% and $f_{\rm res}(\rm LyC)$ = 1.7$^{+15.2}_{-1.7}$\%, respectively. Finally, we find that most of these galaxies have moderate UV and optical SFRs (SFRs $\lesssim$ 10 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$).},

NIR spectra obtained using the Very Large Telescope for 24 new objects bring our total sample of spectroscopically confirmed hyperluminous ($\gt$10$^{13}$ L$_{⊙}$), high-redshift dusty quasars to 38. There is no evidence for reddened quasars having significantly different H{$\alpha$} equivalent widths relative to unobscured quasars. The average black hole masses ({\tilde}10$^{9}$-10$^{10}$ M$_{⊙}$) and bolometric luminosities ({\tilde}10$^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$) are comparable to the most luminous unobscured quasars at the same redshift, but with a tail extending to very high luminosities of {\tilde}10$^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$. 66 per cent of the reddened quasars are detected at $\gt$3{$\sigma$} at 22 {$\mu$}m by WISE. The average 6-{$\mu$}m rest-frame luminosity is log$_{10}$(L$_{6 μm}$/ erg s$^{-1}$) = 47.1 {\plusmn} 0.4, making the objects among the mid-infrared brightest active galactic nuclei (AGN) currently known. The extinction-corrected space density estimate now extends over three magnitudes (-30 $\lt$ M$_{i}$ $\lt$ -27) and demonstrates that the reddened quasar luminosity function is significantly flatter than that of the unobscured quasar population at z = 2-3. At the brightest magnitudes, M$_{i}$ {\lsim} -29, the space density of our dust-reddened population exceeds that of unobscured quasars. A model where the probability that a quasar becomes dust reddened increases at high luminosity is consistent with the observations and such a dependence could be explained by an increase in luminosity and extinction during AGN-fuelling phases. The properties of our obscured type 1 quasars are distinct from the heavily obscured, Compton-thick AGN that have been identified at much fainter luminosities and we conclude that they likely correspond to a brief evolutionary phase in massive galaxy formation.},

The number of infrared-selected, Compton-thick AGNs with 5.8 {$\mu$}m luminosity higher than 10$^{44.2}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ turns out to be similar to that of X-ray-selected, unobscured, and moderately obscured AGNs with 2-10 keV luminosity higher than 10$^{43}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ in the redshift bin 1.2-2.6.

Five of these are spectroscopically confirmed to be heavily reddened type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN) with broad emission lines bringing our total sample of reddened quasars from the UKIDSS-LAS to 12 at z = 1.4-2.7. At these redshifts, H{$\alpha$} (6563 {\AA}) is in the K band. However, the mean H{$\alpha$} equivalent width of the reddened quasars is only 10 per cent larger than that of the optically selected population and cannot explain the extreme colours. Instead, dust extinction of A$_{V}$ {\tilde} 2-6 mag is required to reproduce the continuum colours of our sources. This is comparable to the dust extinctions seen in submillimetre galaxies at similar redshifts. We argue that the AGN are likely being observed in a relatively short-lived breakout phase when they are expelling gas and dust following a massive starburst, subsequently turning into UV-luminous quasars. Some of our quasars show direct evidence for strong outflows (v {\tilde} 800-1000 km s$^{-1}$) affecting the H{$\alpha$} line consistent with this scenario. We predict that a larger fraction of reddened quasar hosts are likely to be submillimetre bright compared to the UV-luminous quasar population. We use our sample to place new constraints on the fraction of obscured type 1 AGN likely to be missed in optical surveys. Taken at face value our findings suggest that the obscured fraction depends on quasar luminosity. The space density of obscured quasars is approximately five times that inferred for UV-bright quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) luminosity function at M$_{i}$ $\lt$ -30 but seems to drop at lower luminosities even accounting for various sources of incompleteness in our sample. We find that at M$_{i}$ {\tilde} -28 for example, this fraction is unlikely to be larger than {\tilde}20 per cent although these fractions are highly uncertain at present due to the small size of our sample. A deeper K-band survey for highly obscured quasars is clearly needed to test this hypothesis fully and is now becoming possible with new sensitive all-sky infrared surveys such as the VISTA Hemisphere Survey and the Wide Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) All Sky Survey.},

We present near-infrared imaging data of the gamma-ray-emitting NLSy1 PKS 1502+036 obtained with the Very Large Telescope. Its surface brightness profile, extending to about 20 kpc, is well described by the combination of a nuclear component and a bulge with a Sersic index $n$ = 3.5, which is indicative of an elliptical galaxy. A circumnuclear structure observed near PKS 1502+036 may be the result of galaxy interactions. A BH mass of about $\sim 7 \times 10^{8}$ M$\_{\odot}$ has been estimated by the bulge luminosity. The presence of an additional faint disc component cannot be ruled out with the present data, but this would reduce the BH mass estimate by only $\sim$ 30\%. These results, together with analogous findings obtained for FBQS J1644+2619, indicate that the relativistic jets in gamma-ray-emitting NLSy1 are likely produced by massive black holes at the center of elliptical galaxies.},

  abstract      = {The main goal of this study was to determine the effects on equivalent widths (EWs) of some spectral lines produced in the quasars by the presence of surrounding galaxies. To carry this out, a sample of 4663 quasars (QSOs) in the redshift range of 0.20 to 0.40 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey--Data Release 7 was analyzed. Three QSO sub-samples were defined, taking into account the projected separations and radial velocity differences with neighboring galaxies. In this way, we utilized two sub-samples of QSOs with strong and weak galaxy interactions, with projected separations smaller than 70 kpc, and between 70 and 140 kpc, respectively, and with radial velocity differences less than $5000~$$\backslash$kms. These sub-samples were compared with isolated QSOs defined as having greater projected separations and radial velocity differences to the galaxies. From a statistical study of the EWs of relevant spectral lines in the QSOs, we show an increment of the EWs of about 20$\backslash$\% in the [OIII]4959,5007 lines and 7$\backslash$\% in H$\_\alpha$ for QSOs with stronger galaxy interactions relative to the isolated QSOs. These results indicate that some line EWs of QSOs could be marginally influenced by the environment and that they are not affected by the emission of the host galaxy, which was estimated to be around 10$\backslash$\% of the total emission. Furthermore, in order to gain a better understanding of the origin of the H$\_{\alpha}$ emission line, we performed broad and narrow line decomposition in 100 QSOs in the restricted Sint sub-sample and also 100 randomly selected QSOs in the Iso sub-sample. When these QSOs were compared, the narrow component remained constant whereas the broad component was incremented. Our results, which reveal slight differences in EWs of some emission lines, suggest that galaxy interactions with QSOs may affect the QSO activity.},

The system has a stellar mass ratio M$\_{1}$/M$\_{2}\approx 0.7$. One of the galaxies (Source 1) shows clear evidence for AGN activity in the form of hard X-ray emission and optical emission-line diagnostics typical of AGN ionisation. The nucleus of the other galaxy (Source 2) has a soft X-ray spectrum, bluer colours, and optical emission line ratios dominated by stellar photoionisation with a ``composite'' signature, which might indicate the presence of a weak AGN. When plotted on a diagram with X-ray luminosity vs [OIII] luminosity both nuclei fall within the locus defined by local Seyfert galaxies. From the optical spectrum we estimate the electron densities finding n$\_{1} \lt 27$ e$^{-}$ cm$^{-3}$ and n$\_{2} \approx 200$ e$^{-}$ cm$^{-3}$. From a 2D decomposition of the surface brightness distribution we infer that both galaxies host rotationally supported bulges (Sersic index $\lt 1$). While the active nature of Source 1 can be established with confidence, whether the nucleus of Source 2 is active remains a matter of debate. Evidence that a faint AGN might reside in its nucleus is, however, tantalising.},

  abstract    = {We report on a search for ultraluminous Lyman alpha emitting galaxies (LAEs) at z=6.6 using the NB921 filter on Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru telescope. We searched a 30 degree squared area around the North Ecliptic Pole, which we observed in broadband g', r', i', z', and y' and narrowband NB816 and NB921, for sources with NB921 < 23.5 and z' - NB921 > 1.3. This corresponds to a selection of log L(Ly-alpha) > 43.5 erg/s. We followed up seven candidate LAEs (out of thirteen) with the Keck DEIMOS spectrograph and confirmed five z=6.6 LAEs, one z=6.6 AGN with a broad Ly-alpha line and a strong red continuum, and one low-redshift ([OIII]5007) galaxy. The five ultraluminous LAEs have wider line profiles than lower luminosity LAEs, and one source, NEPLA4, has a complex line profile similar to that of COLA1. In combination with previous results, we show that the line profiles of the z=6.6 ultraluminous LAEs are systematically different than those of lower luminosity LAEs at this redshift. This result suggests that ultraluminous LAEs generate highly ionized regions of the intergalactic medium in their vicinity that allow the full Lyman alpha profile of the galaxy---including any blue wings---to be visible. If this interpretation is correct, then ultraluminous LAEs offer a unique opportunity to determine the properties of the ionized zones around them, which will help in understanding the ionization of the z ~ 7 intergalactic medium. A simple calculation gives a very rough estimate of 0.015 for the escape fraction of ionizing photons, but more sophisticated calculations are needed to fully characterize the uncertainties.},

SHARDS is a deep imaging survey, made with the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), employing 25 medium band filters in the range from 500 to 941 nm. This is the first time that both LAEs and LBGs are surveyed simultaneously in a systematic way in a large field. We draw a sample of 1558 sources; 528 of them are LAEs. Most of the sources (1434) show rest-frame UV continua. A minority of them (124) are pure LAEs with virtually no continuum detected in SHARDS. We study these sources from $z\sim3.35$ up to $z\sim6.8$, well into the epoch of reionization. Note that surveys done with just one or two narrow band filters lack the possibility to spot the rest-frame UV continuum present in most of our LAEs. We derive redshifts, Star Formation Rates (SFRs), Ly$\alpha$ Equivalent Widths (EWs) and Luminosity Functions (LFs). Grouping within our sample is also studied, finding 92 pairs or small groups of galaxies at the same redshift separated by less than 60 comoving kpc. In addition, we relate 87 and 55 UV-selected objects with two known overdensities at $z=4.05$ and $z=5.198$, respectively. Finally, we show that surveys made with broad band filters are prone to introduce many unwanted sources ($\sim20$% interlopers), which means that previous studies may be overestimating the calculated LFs, specially at the faint end.},

  abstract      = {We measure the cosmological bias factor of DLAs from their cross-correlation with the Ly$\alpha$ forest absorption, as a function of the DLA metal strength, defined from an average of equivalent widths of the strongest detectable low-ionization metal lines. A clear increase of the bias factor with metal strength is detected, as expected from a relation of metallicity and velocity dispersion with host halo mass. The relation is stronger after the metal strength is corrected for the HI column density, to make it more related to metallicity instead of metal column density. After correcting for the effects of measurement errors of the metal strength parameter, we find that the bias factor of DLAs with the weakest metal lines is close to unity, consistent with an origin in dwarf galaxies with host halo masses $\sim 10^{10}\, {\rm M\_\odot} $, whereas the most metal rich DLAs have a bias factor as large as $b\_{\rm DLA}\sim 3$, indicative of massive galaxies or galaxy groups in host halos with masses $\sim 10^{12}\, {\rm M\_\odot} $. Our result confirms the physical origin of the relation of bias factors measured from cross-correlation studies to the host halos of the absorbers.},

  abstract      = {The most robust way for determining the distance of quasar absorption outflows is the use of troughs from ionic excited states. The column density ratio between the excited and resonance states yields the outflow number density. Combined with a knowledge of the outflow's ionization parameter, a distance from the central source (R) can be determined. Here we report results from two surveys targeting outflows that show troughs from S IV. One survey includes 1091 SDSS and BOSS quasar spectra, and the other includes higher-quality spectra of 13 quasars observed with the Very Large Telescope. Our S IV samples include 38 broad absorption line (BAL) outflows, and four mini-BAL outflows. The S IV is formed in the same physical region of the outflow as the canonical outflow-identifying species C IV. Our results show that S IV absorption is only detected in 25\% of C IV BAL outflows. The smaller detection fraction is due to the higher total column density ($N\_H$) needed to detect S IV absorption. Since R empirically anti-correlates with $N\_H$ the results of these surveys can be extrapolated to C IV quasar outflows with lower $N\_H$ as well. We find that at least 50\% of quasar outflows are at distances larger than 100 pc from the central source, and at least 12\% are at distances larger than 1000 pc. These results have profound implications to the study of the origin and acceleration mechanism of quasar outflows and their effects on the host galaxy.},

The central engine is thought to be powered by accretion onto a supermassive black hole. A fraction of this huge release of energy influences the evolution of the host galaxy, and in particular, star formation. Thus, AGN are key astronomical sources not only because they play an important role in the evolution of the Universe, but also because they constitute a laboratory for extreme physics. However, these objects are under the resolution limit of current telescopes. Polarimetry is a unique technique capable of providing us with information on physical AGN structures. The incoming new era of X-ray polarimetry will give us the opportunity to explore the geometry and physical processes taking place in the innermost regions of the accretion disc. Here we exploit this future powerful tool in the particular case of changing-look AGN, which are key for understanding the complexity of AGN physics.},

  abstract      = {We investigate the central sub-arcsec region of the low-luminosity active galactic nucleus NGC 1052, using a high-angular resolution dataset that covers 10 orders of magnitude in frequency. This allows us to infer the continuum emission within the innermost $\sim {17}\,$pc around the black hole to be of non-thermal, synchrotron origin and to set a limit to the maximum contribution of a standard accretion disc. Assuming the canonical 10 per cent mass-light conversion efficiency for the standard accretion disc, its inferred accretion power would be too low by one order of magnitude to account for the observed continuum luminosity. We thus introduce a truncated accretion disc and derive a truncation radius to mass-light conversion efficiency relation, which we use to reconcile the inferred accretion power with the continuum luminosity. As a result we find that a truncated disc providing the necessary accretion power must be truncated at $r\_\text{tr} \gtrsim {26}\, r\_\text{g}$, consistent with the inner radius derived from the observations of the Fe K$\alpha$ line in the X-ray spectrum of this nucleus. This is the first time to derive a limit on the truncation radius of the accretion disc from high-angular resolution data only.},

  abstract    = {We here apply a novel technique selecting quasar candidates purely as sources with zero proper motions in the Gaia data release 2 (DR2). We demonstrate that this approach is highly efficient toward high Galactic latitudes with < 25% contamination from stellar sources. Such a selection technique offers a very pure sample completeness, since all cosmological point sources are selected regardless of their intrinsic spectral properties within the limiting magnitude of Gaia. We carry out a pilot-study by defining a sample compiled by including all Gaia-DR2 sources within one degree of the North Galactic Pole (NGP) selected to have proper motions consistent with zero within 2-sigma uncertainty. By cross-matching the sample to the optical Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the mid-infrared AllWISE photometric catalogues we investigate the colours of each of our sources. Together with already spectroscopically confirmed quasars we are therefore able to determine the efficiency of our selection. The majority of the zero proper motion sources have optical to mid-infrared colours consistent with known quasars. The remaining population may be contaminating stellar sources, but some may also be quasars with colours similar to stars. Spectroscopic follow-up of the zero proper motion sources is needed to unveil such a hitherto hidden quasar population. This approach has the potential to allow substantial progress on many important questions concerning quasars such as determining the fraction of dust-obscured quasars, the fraction of broad absorption line (BAL) quasars, and the metallicity distribution of damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers. The technique could also potentially reveal new types of quasars or even new classes of cosmological point sources.},

  abstract    = {We present the first results from our survey of intervening and proximate Lyman limit systems (LLSs) at $z$$\sim$2.0-2.5 using the Wide Field Camera 3 on-board the Hubble Space Telescope. The quasars in our sample are projected pairs with proper transverse separations $R_\perp$$\leq$150 kpc and line of sight velocity separations $\lesssim$11,000 km/s. We construct a stacked ultraviolet (rest-frame wavelengths 700-2000\AA) spectrum of pairs corrected for the intervening Lyman forest and Lyman continuum absorption. The observed spectral composite presents a moderate flux excess for the most prominent broad emission lines, a $\sim$30% decrease in flux at $\lambda$=800-900\AA\ compared to a stack of brighter quasars not in pairs at similar redshifts, and lower values of the mean free path of the HI ionizing radiation for pairs ($\lambda_{\rm mfp}^{912}=140.7\pm20.2~h_{70}^{-1}$Mpc) compared to single quasars ($\lambda_{\rm mfp}^{912}=213.8\pm28~h_{70}^{-1}$Mpc) at the average redshift $z\simeq2.44$. From the modelling of LLS absorption in these pairs, we find a higher ($\sim$20%) incidence of proximate LLSs with $\log N_{\rm HI}\geq17.2$ at $\delta v$$<$5,000 km/s compared to single quasars ($\sim$6%). These two rates are different at the 5$\sigma$ level. Moreover, we find that optically-thick absorbers are equally shared between foreground and background quasars. Based on these pieces of evidence, we conclude that there is a moderate excess of gas absorbing Lyman continuum photons in our closely-projected quasar pairs compared to single quasars. We argue that this gas arises mostly within large-scale structures or partially neutral regions inside the dark matter haloes where these close pairs reside.},

For the full sample spanning z = 2.2-5 (738 DLAs), f(N $_{H I }$, X) is well fitted by a double power law with a break column density N$_{d}$ = 10$^{21.55±0.04}$ cm$^{-2}$ and low/high-end exponents {$\alpha$} = -2.00 {\plusmn} 0.05, - 6.4$^{+1.1}$ $_{-1.6}$. The shape of f(N $_{H I }$, X) is invariant during this redshift interval and also follows the projected surface density distribution of present-day H I disks as inferred from 21 cm observations. We conclude that H I gas has been distributed in a self-similar fashion for the past 12 Gyr. The normalization of f(N $_{H I }$, X), in contrast, decreases by a factor of 2 during the {\ap}2 Gyr interval from z = 4-2.2 with coincident decreases in both the total covering fraction and {$\rho$}$_{H I }$. At z {\ap} 2, these quantities match the present-day values suggesting no evolution during the past {\ap}10 Gyr. We argue that the evolution at early times is driven by ``violent'' processes that removes gas from nearly half the galaxies at z {\ap} 3 establishing the antecedents of current early-type galaxies. The perceived constancy of {$\rho$}$_{H I }$, meanwhile, implies that H I gas is a necessary but insufficient precondition for star formation and that the global star formation rate is driven by the accretion and condensation of fresh gas from the intergalactic medium.},

  title       = {Radio Properties of Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 Galaxies},
  abstract    = {The last decade has witnessed a steadily increasing number of observational studies concerning the rare class of radio loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, of which several hundred are currently known. According to the current AGN paradigm, the low black hole masses and high accretion rates of narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLSy1) should make them unlikely to launch jets, and indeed the vast majority ($\sim 90\%$) are very radio weak. The remainder, however, display a wide range of radio power, from $\simeq 10^{21}$- $10^{28}$ W/Hz. In this review I discuss recent radio imaging surveys that suggest there are three main classes of NLSy1, which cannot be easily distinguished by the standard radio-loudness parameter alone: (i) radio-weak NLSy1s without jets, (ii) mildly radio-loud NLSy1s that are a mixture of star-forming and jet-dominant AGN, and (iii) very radio loud NLSy1s with extreme properties similar to powerful jet-dominated blazars. I present updated kinematics information from the MOJAVE survey on six of the latter sources (all detected in gamma-rays by Fermi), indicating high bulk Lorentz factors and small viewing angles in three cases. Studies with the JVLA have shown that the jets of radio loud NLSy1s are likely lower- power versions of classical radio galaxies, with typical lengths of less than 10 kpc, although two very radio-loud NLSy1s have de-projected sizes of several hundred kpc. I discuss the challenges of reconciling the heterogeneous radio properties of NLSy1s with their strict optical line criteria, and near-term prospects for the discovery of larger numbers of radio-loud NLSy1s.},

  abstract    = {We present the results of integral field spectroscopy of the gravitational wave (GW) recoiling black hole candidate 3C 186. The goal of the observations is to study the kinematics of the [OIII]5007 narrow emission line region (NLR) of the quasar, and investigate the origin of the velocity offsets originally measured for different UV lines. The results show that i) the spatial structure of the NLR is complex. The [OIII]5007 line shows significant velocity offsets with respect to the systemic redshift of the source. Different components at different velocities (-670, -100, + 75 km s^-1) are produced in different regions of the source. ii) we detect both the narrow and the broad components of the Hbeta line. The narrow component generally follows the kinematics of the [OIII] line, while the broad component is significantly blue-shifted. The peak of the broad line is near the blue end, or possibly outside of the sensitivity band of the instrument, implying a velocity offset of >~1800 km s^-1. This result is in agreement with the interpretation of the QSO as a GW recoiling black hole. The properties of the NLR show that the observed outflows are most likely the effect of radiation pressure on the (photoionized) gas in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy.},

  abstract    = {We present a sub-arcsec resolution radio imaging survey of a sample of 76 low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGN) that were previously not detected with the Very Large Array at 15 GHz. Compact, parsec-scale radio emission has been detected above a flux density of 40 $\mu$Jy in 60% (45 of 76) of the LLAGN sample. We detect 20 out of 31 (64%) low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) nuclei, ten out of 14 (71%) low-luminosity Seyfert galaxies, and 15 out of 31 (48%) transition objects. We use this sample to explore correlations between different emission lines and the radio luminosity. We also populate the X-ray and the optical fundamental plane of black hole activity and further refine its parameters. We obtain a fundamental plane relation of log L$_\textrm{R}$ = $0.48\,(\pm0.04$) log L$_\textrm{X}$ + $0.79\,(\pm0.03$) log $\textrm{M}$ and an optical fundamental plane relation of log L$_\textrm{R}$ = $0.63\,(\pm 0.05)$ log L$_{[\rm O~III]}$ + $0.67\,(\pm 0.03)$ log $\textrm{M}$ after including all the LLAGN detected at high resolution at 15 GHz, and the best-studied hard-state X-ray binaries (luminosities are given in erg s$^{-1}$ while the masses are in units of solar mass). Finally, we find conclusive evidence that the nuclear 15 GHz radio luminosity function (RLF) of all the detected Palomar Sample LLAGN has a turnover at the low-luminosity end, and is best-fitted with a broken power law. The break in the power law occurs at a critical mass accretion rate of 1.2$\times$10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$/yr, which translates to an Eddington ratio of $\rm \dot m_{Edd} \sim 5.1 \times 10^{-5}$, assuming a black hole mass of 10$^9 M_{\odot}$. The local group stands closer to the extrapolation of the higher-luminosity sources, and the classical Seyferts agree with the nuclear RLF of the LLAGN in the local universe.},

  abstract    = {We investigated narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) at optical, mid-infrared (MIR) and X-ray wavelengths, comparing them to the broad line active galactic nuclei (BLAGNs). We found that black hole mass, coronal line luminosities, X-ray hardness ratio and X-ray, optical and MIR luminosities are higher for the BLAGNs than for NLS1s, while policyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contribution and the accretion rates are higher for the NLS1s. Furthermore, we found some trends among spectral parameters that NLS1s have and BLAGNs do not have. The evolution of FWHM(H$\beta$) with the luminosities of MIR and coronal lines, continuum luminosities, PAH contribution, H$\beta$ broad line luminosity, FWHM[O\,III] and EW(H$\beta$NLR), are important trends found for NLS1s. That may contribute to the insight that NLS1s are developing AGNs, growing their black holes, while their luminosities and FWHM(H$\beta$) consequently grow, and that BLAGNs are mature, larger objects of slower and/or different evolution. Black hole mass is related to PAH contribution only for NLS1s, which may suggest that PAHs are more efficiently destroyed in NLS1s.},

  title       = {The environmental properties of radio-emitting AGN},
  abstract    = {We study the environmental properties of z<1.2 radio-selected AGN belonging to the ~2 square degrees of the COSMOS field, finding that about 20% of them appear within overdense structures. AGN with $P[1.4 GHz]>10^{23.5} W Hz^{-1} sr^{-1}$ are twice more likely to be found in clusters with respect to fainter sources (~38% vs ~15%), just as radio-selected AGN with stellar masses $M*>10^{11} M_\odot$ are twice more likely to be found in overdense environments with respect to objects of lower mass (~24% vs ~11%). Comparisons with galaxy samples further suggest that radio-selected AGN of large stellar mass tend to avoid underdense environments more than normal galaxies with the same stellar content. Stellar masses also seem to determine the location of radio-active AGN within clusters: ~100% of the sources found as satellite galaxies have $M*<10^{11.3} M_\odot$, while ~100% of the AGN coinciding with a cluster central galaxy have $M*>10^{11} M_\odot$. No different location within the cluster is instead observed for AGN of various radio luminosities. Radio AGN which also emit in the MIR show a marked preference to be found as isolated galaxies (~70%) at variance with those also active in the X-ray which all seem to reside within overdensities. What emerges from our work is a scenario whereby physical processes on sub-pc and kpc scales (e.g. emission respectively related to the AGN and to star formation) are strongly interconnected with the large-scale environment of the AGN itself.},

  title       = {Characterising the Circum-Galactic Medium of Damped Lyman-$α$ Absorbing Galaxies},
  abstract    = {Gas flows in and out of galaxies through their circumgalactic medium (CGM) are poorly constrained and direct observations of this faint, diffuse medium remain challenging. We use a sample of five $z$ $\sim$ 1-2 galaxy counterparts to Damped Lyman-$\alpha$ Absorbers (DLAs) to combine data on cold gas, metals and stellar content of the same galaxies. We present new HST/WFC3 imaging of these fields in 3-5 broadband filters and characterise the stellar properties of the host galaxies. By fitting the spectral energy distribution, we measure their stellar masses to be in the range of log($M_*$/$\text{M}_{\odot}$) $\sim$ 9.1$-$10.7. Combining these with IFU observations, we find a large spread of baryon fractions inside the host galaxies, between 7 and 100 percent. Similarly, we find gas fractions between 3 and 56 percent. Given their star formation rates, these objects lie on the expected main sequence of galaxies. Emission line metallicities indicate they are consistent with the mass-metallicity relation for DLAs. We also report an apparent anti-correlation between the stellar masses and $N$(HI), which could be due to a dust bias effect or lower column density systems tracing more massive galaxies. We present new ALMA observations of one of the targets leading to a molecular gas mass of log($M_{\rm mol}$/$\text{M}_{\odot}$) < 9.89. We also investigate the morphology of the DLA counterparts and find that most of the galaxies show a clumpy structure and suggest ongoing tidal interaction. Thanks to our high spatial resolution HST data, we gain new insights in the structural complexity of the CGM.},

  abstract = {We present the results from a damped Ly{$\alpha$} survey of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Data Release 3. We have discovered over 500 new damped Ly{$\alpha$} systems at z$\gt$2.2, and the complete statistical sample for z$\gt$1.6 has more than 600 damped Ly{$\alpha$} galaxies. We measure the H I column density distribution f$_{HI}$(N, X) and its zeroth and first moments (the incidence l$_{DLA}$ and gas mass density {$\Omega$}$^{DLA}$$_{g}$ of damped Ly{$\alpha$} systems, respectively) as a function of redshift. The key results include: (1) the full SDSS DR3 f$_{HI}$(N, X) distribution (z\~{}3.06) is well fit by a {$\Gamma$} function (or double power law) with ``break'' column density N$_{γ}$=10$^{21.5+/-0.1}$ cm$^{-2}$ and ``faint-end'' slope {$\alpha$}=-1.8+/-0.1 (2) the shape of the f$_{HI}$(N, X) distributions in a series of redshift bins does not show evolution; (3) the incidence and gas mass density of damped systems decrease by 35\%+/-9\% and 50\%+/-10\% during \~{}1 Gyr between the redshift intervals z=[3.0, 3.5] and z=[2.2, 2.5] and (4) the incidence and gas mass density of damped Ly{$\alpha$} systems in the lowest SDSS redshift bin (z=2.2) are consistent with the current values. We investigate a number of systematic errors in damped Ly{$\alpha$} analysis and identify only one important effect: we measure 40\%+/-20\% higher {$\Omega$}$^{DLA}$$_{g}$ values toward a subset of brighter quasars than toward a faint subset. This effect is contrary to the bias associated with dust obscuration and suggests that gravitational lensing may be important. Comparing the results against several models of galaxy formation in {$\Lambda$}CDM, we find that all of the models significantly underpredict l$_{DLA}$ at z=3, and only SPH models with significant feedback can reproduce {$\Omega$}$^{DLA}$$_{g}$ at high redshift. Based on our results for the damped Ly{$\alpha$} systems, we argue that the Lyman limit systems contribute \~{}33\% of the universe's H I atoms at all redshifts z=2-5. Furthermore, we infer that the f$_{HI}$(N, X) distribution for N$_{HI}$$\lt$10$^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ has an inflection with slope dlogf/dlogN$\gt$-1. We advocate a new mass density definition, the mass density of predominantly neutral gas {$\Omega$}$^{neut}$$_{g}$, to be contrasted with the mass density of gas associated with H I atoms. We contend the damped Ly{$\alpha$} systems contribute $\gt$80\% of {$\Omega$}$^{neut}$$_{g}$ at all redshifts and therefore are the main reservoirs for star formation.},

  abstract      = {Extended narrow-line regions (NLRs) around active galactic nuclei (AGN) are shaped by the distribution of gas in the host galaxy and by the geometry of the circumnuclear obscuration, and thus they can be used to test the AGN unification model. In this work, we quantify the morphologies of the narrow-line regions in 308 nearby AGNs ($z=0-0.14$, $\backslash$lbol $\sim 10^{42.4-44.1}$ $\backslash$erg$\{$$\}$) from the MaNGA survey. Based on the narrow-line region maps, we find that a large fraction (81$\backslash$\%) of these AGN have bi-conical NLR morphology. The distribution of their measured opening angles suggests that the intrinsic opening angles of the ionization cones has a mean value of 85--98$^\circ$ with a finite spread of 39-44$^\circ$ (1-$\sigma$). Our inferred opening angle distribution implies a number ratio of type I to type II AGN of 1:1.6--2.3, consistent with other measurements of the type I / type II ratio at low AGN luminosities. Combining these measurements with the WISE photometry data, we find that redder mid-IR color (lower effective temperature of dust) corresponds to stronger and narrower photo-ionized bicones. This relation is in agreement with the unification model that suggests that the bi-conical narrow-line regions are shaped by a toroidal dusty structure within a few pc from the AGN. Furthermore, we find a significant alignment between the minor axis of host galaxy disks and AGN ionization cones. Together, these findings suggest that obscuration on both circumnuclear ($\sim $pc) and galactic ($\sim$ kpc) scales are important in shaping and orienting the AGN narrow-line regions.},

Compared to multi-epoch mid-IR photometry of a large sample of SDSS-confirmed quasars, WISE J1052+1519 is an extreme photometric outlier, fading by more than a factor of two at $3.4$ and $4.6 \mu$m since 2009. Swift target-of-opportunity observations in 2017 show even stronger fading in the soft X-rays compared to the ROSAT detection of this source in 1995, with at least a factor of fifteen decrease. We obtained second-epoch spectroscopy with the Palomar telescope in 2017 which, when compared with the 2006 archival SDSS spectrum, reveals that the broad H$\beta$ emission has vanished and that the quasar has become significantly redder. The two most likely interpretations for this dramatic change are source fading or obscuration, where the latter is strongly disfavored by the mid-IR data. We discuss various physical scenarios that could cause such changes in the quasar luminosity over this timescale, and favor changes in the innermost regions of the accretion disk that occur on the thermal and heating/cooling front timescales. We discuss possible physical triggers that could cause these changes, and predict the multiwavelength signatures that could distinguish these physical scenarios.},

  abstract      = {Changing-look quasars are a recently identified class of active galaxies in which the strong UV continuum and/or broad optical hydrogen emission lines associated with unobscured quasars either appear or disappear on timescales of months to years. The physical processes responsible for this behaviour are still debated, but changes in the black hole accretion rate or accretion disk structure appear more likely than changes in obscuration. Here we report on four epochs of spectroscopy of SDSS J110057.70-005304.5, a quasar at a redshift of $z=0.378$ whose UV continuum and broad hydrogen emission lines have faded, and then returned over the past $\approx$20 years. The change in this quasar was initially identified in the infrared, and an archival spectrum from 2010 shows an intermediate phase of the transition during which the flux below rest-frame $\approx$3400$\backslash$AA$\backslash$ has decreased by close to an order of magnitude. This combination is unique compared to previously published examples of changing-look quasars, and is best explained by dramatic changes in the innermost regions of the accretion disk. The optical continuum has been rising since mid-2016, leading to a prediction of a rise in hydrogen emission line flux in the next year. Increases in the infrared flux are beginning to follow, delayed by a $\sim$3 year observed timescale. If our model is confirmed, the physics of changing-look quasars are governed by processes at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) around the black hole, and the structure of the innermost disk. The easily identifiable and monitored changing-look quasars would then provide a new probe and laboratory of the nuclear central engine.},

  abstract    = {We model the broadband (optical/UV and X-ray) continuum spectrum of the "changing-look" active galactic nucleus (AGN) Mrk 1018 as it fades from Seyfert 1 to 1.9 in $\sim 8$ years. The brightest spectrum, with Eddington ratio $L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.08$, has a typical type 1 AGN continuum, with a strong "soft X-ray excess" spanning between the UV and soft X-rays. The dimmest spectrum, at $L/L_{\rm Edd} \sim 0.006$, is very different in shape as well as luminosity, with the soft excess dropping by much more than the hard X-rays. The soft X-ray excess produces most of the ionizing photons, so its dramatic drop leads to the disappearance of the broad line region, driving the "changing-look" phenomena. This spectral hardening appears similar to the soft-to-hard state transition in black hole binaries at $L/L_{\rm Edd} \sim 0.02$, where the inner disc evaporates into an advection dominated accretion flow, while the overall drop in luminosity appears consistent with the Hydrogen ionization disc instability. Nonetheless, both processes happen much faster in Mrk 1018 than predicted by disc theory. We critically examine scaling from galactic binary systems, and show that a major difference is that radiation pressure should be much more important in AGN, so that the sound speed is much faster than expected from the gas temperature. Including magnetic pressure to stabilize the disc shortens the timescales even further. We suggest that all changing-look AGNs are similarly associated with the state transition at $L/L_{\rm Edd} \sim$ a few percent.},

  abstract    = {We present a catalogue of local ($z<0.1$) galaxies that contain faint AGN. We select these objects by identifying galaxies that exhibit a significant excess in their radio luminosities, compared to what is expected from the observed levels of star-formation activity in these systems. This is achieved by comparing the optical (spectroscopic) star formation rate (SFR) to the 1.4~GHz luminosity measured from the FIRST survey. The majority of the AGN identified in this study are fainter than those in previous work, such as in the Best and Heckman (2012) catalogue. We show that these faint AGN make a non-negligible contribution to the radio luminosity function at low luminosities (below $10^{22.5}$ W Hz$^{-1}$), and host $\sim$13 per cent of the local radio luminosity budget. Their host galaxies are predominantly high stellar-mass systems (with a median stellar mass of $10^{11}\textrm{M}_{\odot}$), are found across a range of environments (but typically in denser environments than star-forming galaxies) and have early-type morphologies. This study demonstrates a general technique to identify AGN in galaxy populations where reliable optical SFRs can be extracted using spectro-photometry and where radio data are also available so that a radio excess can be measured. Our results also demonstrate that it is unsafe to infer SFRs from radio emission \textit{alone}, even if bright AGN have been excluded from a sample, since there is a significant population of faint radio AGN which may contaminate the radio-derived SFRs.},

  abstract    = {We investigated the detailed radio structure of the jet of 1H 0323+342 using high-resolution multi-frequency Very Long Baseline Array observations. This source is known as the nearest $\gamma$-ray emitting radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxy. We discovered that the morphology of the inner jet is well characterized by a parabolic shape, indicating the jet being continuously collimated near the jet base. On the other hand, we found that the jet expands more rapidly at larger scales, resulting in a conical-like shape. The location of the "collimation break" is coincident with a bright quasi-stationary feature at 7 mas from core (corresponding to a deprojected distance of the order of $\sim$100pc), where the jet width locally contracts together with highly polarized signals, suggesting a recollimation shock. We found that the collimation region is coincident with the region where the jet speed gradually accelerates, suggesting the coexistence of the jet acceleration and collimation zone, ending up with the recollimation shock, which could be a potential site of high-energy $\gamma$-ray flares detected by the Fermi-LAT. Remarkably, these observational features of the 1H 0323+342 jet are overall very similar to those of the nearby radio galaxy M87 and HST-1 as well as some blazars, suggesting that a common jet formation mechanism might be at work. Based on the similarity of the jet profile between the two sources, we also briefly discuss the mass of the central black hole of 1H 0323+342, which is also still highly controversial on this source and NLS1s in general.},

  abstract    = {One of the main challenges for polarimetric observations of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is to properly estimate the amount of parasitic light that contaminates the polarization signal. Removing this unpolarized flux is a complex task that has only been achieved in a couple of objects. In this fifth paper of the series, we present a new version of the Monte Carlo code STOKES that accounts for dilution by interstellar polarization and host starlight in radiative transfer modeling. We upgrade our code by including spectral energy distribution (SED) templates for a set of representative host galaxies. The unpolarized light emitted by those hosts alters the observer polarization while being coherently radiatively coupled to the AGN structure. We also include in our analysis tool a routine that may add, depending on the user's objectives, an interstellar component. Using a generic AGN model, we illustrate how interstellar polarization and starlight dilution impact the observed polarimetric signal of AGN. We apply our code to NGC-1068, an archetypal edge-on AGN and demonstrate that STOKES can reproduce its SED, the expected wavelength-dependent polarimetric signatures, and the observed high-angular resolution polarimetric maps. Using the flexibility of the code, we derive several intrinsic parameters such as the system inclination and the torus opening angle. The new version of our publicly available code now allows observers to better prepare their observations, interpret their data and simulate the three-dimensional geometry and physics of AGN in order to probe unresolved structures. Additionally, the radiative interaction between the host and the AGN can be used to probe the co-evolution of the system.},

Their outstanding sensitivity and spectral characterization of faint sources allow us to focus on the sub-$L\_*$ regime (log$L\_{\mathrm{X}}\lesssim44$), poorly sampled by previous works using shallower data, and the obscured population. Taking fully into account the individual photometric-redshift probability distribution functions, the final sample consists of $\approx102$ X-ray selected AGN at $3\leq z \lt 6$. The fraction of AGN obscured by column densities log$N\_{\mathrm{H}}\gt23$ is $\sim0.6-0.8$, once incompleteness effects are taken into account, with no strong dependence on redshift or luminosity. We derived the high-redshift AGN number counts down to $F\_{\mathrm{0.5-2\,keV}}=7\times10^{-18}\,\mathrm{erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$, extending previous results to fainter fluxes, especially at $z\gt4$. We put the tightest constraints to date on the low-luminosity end of AGN luminosity function at high redshift. The space-density, in particular, declines at $z\gt3$ at all luminosities, with only a marginally steeper slope for low-luminosity AGN. By comparing the evolution of the AGN and galaxy densities, we suggest that such a decline at high luminosities is mainly driven by the underlying galaxy population, while at low luminosities there are hints of an intrinsic evolution of the parameters driving nuclear activity. Also, the black-hole accretion rate density and star-formation rate density, which are usually found to evolve similarly at $z\lesssim3$, appear to diverge at higher redshifts.},

  abstract      = {We investigate the dependence of black-hole accretion rate (BHAR) on host-galaxy star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass ($M\_*$) in the CANDELS/GOODS-South field in the redshift range of $0.5\leq z \lt 2.0$. Our sample consists of $\approx 18000$ galaxies, allowing us to probe galaxies with $0.1 \lesssim \mathrm{SFR} \lesssim 100\ M\_\odot\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and/or $10^8 \lesssim M\_* \lesssim 10^{11}\ M\_{\odot}$. We use sample-mean BHAR to approximate long-term average BHAR. Our sample-mean BHARs are derived from the $Chandra$ Deep Field-South 7 Ms observations, while the SFRs and $M\_*$ have been estimated by the CANDELS team through SED fitting. The average BHAR is correlated positively with both SFR and $M\_*$, and the BHAR-SFR and BHAR-$M\_*$ relations can both be described acceptably by linear models with a slope of unity. However, BHAR appears to be correlated more strongly with $M\_*$ than SFR. This result indicates that $M\_*$ is the primary host-galaxy property related to black-hole growth, and the apparent BHAR-SFR relation is largely a secondary effect due to the star-forming main sequence. Among our sources, massive galaxies ($M\_* \gtrsim 10^{10} M\_{\odot}$) have significantly higher BHAR/SFR ratios than less-massive galaxies, indicating the former have higher black-hole fueling efficiency and/or higher SMBH occupation fraction than the latter. Our results can naturally explain the observed proportionality between $M\_{\rm BH}$ and $M\_*$ for local giant ellipticals, and suggest their $M\_{\rm BH}/M\_*$ is higher than that of local star-forming galaxies. Among local star-forming galaxies, massive systems might have higher $M\_{\rm BH}/M\_*$ compared to dwarfs.},

  abstract      = {We report the discovery of 31 new redshifted broad absorption line quasars (RSBALs) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The number of previously known such objects is 19. The identification of the new objects was enabled by calculating similarities between quasar spectra in the SDSS. Using these similarities we look for the objects that are similar to the ones in the original sample, visually inspecting only hundreds, out of over 160,000 spectra considered. We compare the performance of several similarity measures, as well as different methods of employing them, in finding the RSBALs. We find that decision tree based similarities recover the most objects, and that an ensemble of methods performs better than any single one. As the similarities are not tailored for the specific problem of finding RSBALs, they could be used for searching for other types of quasars. The similarities and the code for their calculation are available online.},

  abstract      = {We study the interstellar medium (ISM) properties of three heavily reddened quasars at $z\sim2.5$ as well as three millimetre-bright companion galaxies near these quasars. New JVLA and ALMA observations constrain the CO(1-0), CO(7-6) and [CI]$^3$P$\_2-^3$P$\_1$ line emission as well as the far infrared to radio continuum. The gas excitation and physical properties of the ISM are constrained by comparing our observations to photo-dissociation region (PDR) models. The ISM in our high-redshift quasars is composed of very high-density, high-temperature gas which is already highly enriched in elements like carbon. One of our quasar hosts is shown to be a close-separation ($\lt$2 arcsec) major merger with different line emission properties in the millimeter-bright galaxy and quasar components. Low angular resolution observations of high-redshift quasars used to assess quasar excitation properties should therefore be interpreted with caution as they could potentially be averaging over multiple components with different ISM conditions. Our quasars and their companion galaxies show a range of CO excitation properties spanning the full extent from starburst-like to quasar-like spectral line energy distributions. We compare gas masses based on CO, CI and dust emission, and find that these can disagree when standard assumptions are made regarding the values of $\alpha\_{\rm{CO}}$, the gas-to-dust ratio and the atomic carbon abundances. We conclude that the ISM properties of our quasars and their companion galaxies are diverse and likely vary spatially across the full extent of these complex, merging systems.},

It represents the tightest candidate obscured/unobscured dual AGN system at z$\gt$3. To verify the dual AGN scenario we obtained deep $K\_s$ band (rest-frame $V$ band) imaging with the VLT/HAWK-I+GRAAL instrument at 0.4`` resolution during science verification in January 2018. Indeed, we detect the individual host galaxies of the QSO and Jil with estimated stellar masses of $\log(M\_\star/M\_{\odot})=11.4\pm0.5$ and $\log(M\_\star/M\_{\odot})=10.9\pm0.5$, respectively. Near-IR spectra obtained with VLT-KMOS reveal a clear [OIII] $\lambda$5007 line detection at the location of Jil which does not contribute significantly to the $K\_s$ band flux. Both observations therefore corroborate the dual AGN scenario. A comparison to Illustris cosmological simulations suggests a parent halo mass of $\log(M\_\mathrm{halo}/M\_{\odot})=13.2\pm0.5$ for this interacting galaxy system, corresponding to a very massive dark matter halo at that epoch.},

This is consistent with most of the H$\{$$\backslash$sc i$\}$ along the sightline arising in the stable warm neutral medium (WNM). The low peak H$\{$$\backslash$sc i$\}$ 21cm optical depth towards B0438$-$436 implies negligible self-absorption, allowing a multi-Gaussian joint decomposition of the H$\{$$\backslash$sc i$\}$ 21cm absorption and emission spectra. This yields a gas kinetic temperature of $\rm T\_k \leq (4910 \pm 1900)$\~{}K, and a spin temperature of $\rm T\_s = (1000 \pm 345)$\~{}K for the gas that gives rise to the H$\{$$\backslash$sc i$\}$ 21cm absorption.

  abstract      = {New methods have been recently developed to search for strong gravitational lenses, in particular lensed quasars, in wide-field imaging surveys. Here, we compare the performance of three different, morphology-based methods to find lens candidates over the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) DR3 footprint (440 deg$^2$). The three methods are: i) a multiplet detection in KiDS-DR3 and/or Gaia-DR1, ii) direct modeling of KiDS cutouts and iii) positional offsets between different surveys (KiDS-vs-Gaia, Gaia-vs-2MASS), with purpose-built astrometric recalibrations. The first benchmark for the methods has been set by the recovery of known lenses. We are able to recover seven out of ten known lenses and pairs of quasars observed in the KiDS DR3 footprint, or eight out of ten with improved selection criteria and looser colour pre-selection. This success rate reflects the combination of all methods together, which, taken individually, performed significantly worse (four lenses each). One movelty of our analysis is that the comparison of the performances of the different methods has revealed the pros and cons of the approaches and, most of all, the complementarities. We finally provide a list of high-grade candidates found by one or more methods, awaiting spectroscopic follow-up for confirmation. Of these, KiDS 1042+0023 is to our knowledge the first confirmed lensed quasar from KiDS, exhibiting two quasar spectra at the same source redshift at either sides of a red galaxy, with uniform flux-ratio $f\approx1.25$ over the wavelength range $0.45\mu\mathrm{m}\lt\lambda\lt0.75\mu\mathrm{m}.$},

(2010, MILES), and solar metallicity Maraston and Stromback (2011) (MS11solar) stellar population models. The line fluxes obtained using BC03 and MS11solar are publicly available from SDSS data releases. We find that the BC03 templates result in systematically higher BPT line ratios and consequently higher AGN fractions and the MS11solar templates result in systematically lower line ratios and AGN fractions compared with the MILES templates. Using MILES as the standard, BC03 results in 25\% ``false positives'' and MS11solar results in 22\% ``false negatives'' when using the Kewley et al. (2001a) boundary for AGN identification. The fraction of galaxies whose AGN identification changes for different templates is luminosity dependent, ranging from a few percent for L[OIII]5007 $\gt$= 10\^{}40 erg s-1 and increasing to \~{} 50\% for L[OIII]5007 $\lt$= 10\^{}38 erg s-1.

We explore the host galaxy of the brightest quasar in the large volume cosmological hydrodynamic simulation BlueTides, which in Phase II has reached these redshifts. The brightest quasar in BlueTides has a luminosity of a $\sim$ few $10^{13} L\_{\odot}$ and a black hole mass of $6.4 \times 10^{8} M\_{\odot}$ at $z \sim 7.5$, comparable to the observed quasar (the only one in this large volume). The quasar resides in a rare halo of mass $M\_{H} \sim 10^{12} M\_{\odot}$ and has a host galaxy of stellar mass of $4 \times 10^{10}M\_{\odot}$ with an ongoing (intrinsic) star formation rate of $\sim 80 M\_{\odot} yr^{-1}$. The corresponding intrinsic UV magnitude of the galaxy is $-23.1$, which is roughly $2.7$ magnitudes fainter than the quasar's magnitude of $-25.9$. We find that the galaxy is highly metal enriched with a mean metallicity equal to the solar value. We derive quasar and galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) in the mid and near infrared JWST bands. We predict a significant amount of dust attenuation in the rest-frame UV corresponding to $A\_{1500} \sim 1.7$ giving an UV based SFR of $\sim 14 M\_{\odot} yr^{-1}$. We present mock JWST images of the galaxy with and without central point source, in different MIRI and NIRCam filters. The host galaxy is detectable in NIRCam filters, but it is extremely compact ($R\_{E}=0.35$ kpc). It will require JWST's exquisite sensitivity and resolution to separate the galaxy from the central point source. Finally within the FOV of the quasar in BlueTides there are two more sources that would be detectable by JWST.},

There is growing observational evidence for quasar-launched massive outflows at z$\gt$6, while the details of outflow-host galaxy interaction remain obscure. In this paper, we study the feedback around the highest redshift quasar in the BlueTides simulation, the largest volume cosmological hydrodynamic simulation so far carried out. We present predictions for gas outflows around the brightest $z = 7.54$ quasar which hosts the most massive black hole in the simulation volume, which has grown to black hole mass $6.7\times 10^{8}{\rm M}\_\odot$ consistent with the current record holder for high-z quasars. We introduce a method to identify and trace the gas outflowing from the halo. We find that the total mass of the outflow gas is about $3.6\times 10^{9}{\rm M}\_\odot$, constituting 6$\backslash$\% of the total gas in the halo. The outflow gas contains a cold, dense molecular component with mass about $2.6\times 10^{8}{\rm M}\_\odot$, that originates from the inner region of the halo, within a few kpc of the central black hole. The velocities of the outflow gas reach thousands of km/s, within which the molecular component has mass averaged outward radial velocity of $1300$ km/s, consistent with observations. The averaged outflow rate is about $200-300 {\rm M}\_\odot/yr$, with the outflowing gas mainly in a hotter ($T \sim 10^7$ K) and lower density state than the average of the host halo gas.},

We reveal very broad [CII] wings tracing the presence of outflows with velocities in excess of 1000 km/s. We find that the luminosity of the broad [CII] emission increases with LAGN, while it does not significantly depend on the SFR of the host galaxy, indicating that the central AGN is the main driving mechanism of the [CII] outflows in these powerful, distant QSOs. From the stack of the ALMA cubes, we derive an average outflow spatial extent of \~{}2 kpc. The average mass outflow rate inferred from the whole sample stack is \~{} 170 Msun/yr, while for the most luminous systems it increases to \~{}340 Msun/yr. The associated outflow kinetic power is about 0.1$\backslash$\% of LAGN, while the outflow momentum rate is about LAGN/c or lower, suggesting that these outflows are either driven by radiation pressure onto dusty clouds or, alternatively, are driven by the nuclear wind and energy conserving but with low coupling with the ISM.

We do not detect CO emission from the previously identified DLA galaxy counterpart. The limit we infer on M\_gas / M\_star is in the low end of the range found for DLA galaxies, but is still consistent with what is found for other star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts. Instead we detect CO(3-2) emission from another intensely star-forming galaxy at an impact parameter of 117 kpc from the line-of-sight to the quasar and 131 km s\^{}-1 redshifted relative to the velocity centroid of the DLA in the quasar spectrum. In the velocity profile of the low- and high-ionisation absorption lines of the DLA there is an absorption component consistent with the redshift of this CO-emitting galaxy. It is plausible that this component is physically associated with a strong outflow in the plane of the sky from the CO-emitting galaxy. If true, this would be further evidence, in addition to what is already known from studies of Lyman-break galaxies, that galactic outflows can be traced beyond 100 kpc from star-forming galaxies. The case of this z=2.583 structure is an illustration of this in a group environment.},

The detections are a plausible indicator of the presence of a powerful, most likely relativistic jet because this intensity of emission at 37 GHz cannot be explained by, for example, radiation from supernova remnants. Additionally, one of the detected NLS1 galaxies is a newly discovered source of gamma rays and three others are candidates for future detections.},

  abstract    = {NGC 3393, a nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy with nuclear radio jets, large-scale and nuclear bars, and a posited secondary super massive black hole, provides an interesting laboratory to test the physics of inflows and outflows. Here we present and analyse the molecular gas (ALMA observations of CO J:2-1 emission over a field of view (FOV) of 45\arcsec \times 45\arcsec, at 0\farcs56 (143 pc) spatial and 5 km/s spectral resolution), ionised gas and stars (GEMINI-GMOS/IFU; over a FOV of 4\arcsec \times 5\arcsec, at 0\farcs62 (159 pc) spatial and 23 km/s spectral resolution) in NGC 3393. The ionised gas emission, detected over the complete GEMINI-GMOS FOV, has three identifiable kinematic components. A narrow (\sigma < 115 km/s) component present in the complete FOV, which is consistent with rotation in the galaxy disk. A broad (\sigma > 115 km/s) redshifted component, detected near the NE and SW radio lobes; which we interpret as a radio jet driven outflow. And a broad (\sigma > 115 km/s) blueshifted component that shows high velocities in a region perpendicular to the radio jet axis; we interpret this as an equatorial outflow. The CO J:2-1 emission is detected in spiral arms on 5\arcsec - 20\arcsec scales, and in two disturbed circumnuclear regions. The molecular kinematics in the spiral arms can be explained by rotation. The highly disturbed kinematics of the inner region can be explained by perturbations induced by the nuclear bar and interactions with the large scale bar. We find no evidence for, but cannot strongly rule out, the presence of the posited secondary black hole.},

  abstract      = {Although studying outflows in the host galaxies of AGN have become the forefront of extra-galactic astronomy in recent years, estimating the energy associated with these outflows have been a major challenge. Determination of the energy associated with an outflow often involves an assumption of uniform density in the NLR, which span a wide range in literature leading to large systematic uncertainties in energy estimation. In this paper, we present electron density maps for a sample of outflowing and non-outflowing Seyfert galaxies at z$\lt$0.02 drawn from the S7 survey and understand the origin and values of the observed density structures to reduce the systematic uncertainties in outflow energy estimation. We use the ratio of the [SII]6716,6731 emission lines to derive spatially resolved electron densities ($\lt$50-2000 cm$^{-3}$). Using optical IFU observations, we are able to measure densities across the central 2-5 kpc of the selected AGN host galaxies. We compare the density maps with the positions of the HII regions derived from the narrow H$\alpha$ component, ionization maps from [OIII], and spatially resolved BPT diagrams, to infer the origin of the observed density structures. We also use the electron density maps to construct density profiles as a function of distance from the central AGN. We find a spatial correlation between the sites of high star formation and high electron density for targets without an active ionized outflow. The non-outflowing targets also show an exponential drop in the electron density as a function of distance from the center, with a mean exponential index of \~{}0.15. The correlation between the star forming sites and electron density ceases for targets with an outflow. The density within the outflowing medium is not uniform and shows both low and high density sites, most likely due to the presence of shocks and highly turbulent medium.},

  abstract      = {Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are powered by the accretion of material onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH), and are among the most luminous objects in the Universe. However, the huge radiative power of most AGN cannot be seen directly, as the accretion is ``hidden'' behind gas and dust that absorbs many of the characteristic observational signatures. This obscuration presents an important challenge for uncovering the complete AGN population and understanding the cosmic evolution of SMBHs. In this review we describe a broad range of multi-wavelength techniques that are currently employed to identify obscured AGN, and assess the reliability and completeness of each technique. We follow with a discussion of the demographics of obscured AGN activity, explore the nature and physical scales of the obscuring material, and assess the implications of obscured AGN for observational cosmology. We conclude with an outline of the prospects for future progress from both observations and theoretical models, and highlight some of the key outstanding questions.},

  abstract      = {The quasar lifetime $t\_{\rm\,Q}$ is one of the most fundamental quantities for understanding quasar evolution and the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), but remains uncertain by several orders of magnitude. In a recent study we uncovered a population of very young quasars ($t\_{\rm Q}\lesssim10^4-10^5$ yr), based on the sizes of their proximity zones, which are regions of enhanced Ly$\alpha$ forest transmission near the quasar resulting from its own ionizing radiation. The presence of such young objects poses significant challenges to models of SMBH formation, which already struggle to explain the existence of SMBHs at such early cosmic epochs. We conduct the first comprehensive spectroscopic study of the youngest quasar known, $\rm SDSS\,J1335+3533$ at $z=5.9012$, whose lifetime is $t\_{\rm Q}\lt10^4$ yr ($95\\%$ confidence). A careful search of our deep optical and near-infrared spectra for HI and metal absorption lines allows us to convincingly exclude that its small proximity zone results from an associated absorption system rather than a short lifetime. We use the MgII emission line to measure its black hole mass $M\_{\rm BH}=(4.09\pm0.58)\times 10^9 M\_{\odot}$, implying an Eddington ratio of $0.30\pm0.04$ -- comparable to other co-eval quasars. We similarly find that the relationship between its black hole mass and dynamical mass are consistent with other $z\sim6$ quasars. The only possible anomaly associated with youth are its weak emission lines, but larger samples are needed to shed light on a potential causal connection. We discuss the implications of short lifetimes for various SMBH growth scenarios, and argue that future observations of young quasars with JWST could distinguish between them.},

Our Lya emission samples are spectra of BOSS Luminous Red Galaxies from Data Release 12 with the best fit model galaxies subtracted. We cross-correlate the residual flux in these spectra with BOSS quasars, and detect a positive signal on scales 1-15 Mpc/h. We identify and remove a source of contamination not previously accounted for, due to the effects of quasar clustering on cross-fibre light. Corrected, our quasar-Lya emission cross-correlation is 50 \% lower than that seen by Croft et al. for DR10, but still significant. Because only 3\% of space is within 15 Mpc/h of a quasar, the result does not fully explore the global large-scale structure of Lya emission. To do this, we cross-correlate with the Lya forest. We find no signal in this case. The 95\% upper limit on the global Lya mean surface brightness from Lya emission-Lya forest cross-correlation is mu $\lt$ 1.2x10\^{}-22 erg/s/cm\^{}2/A/arcsec\^{}2 This null result rules out the scenario where the observed quasar-Lya emission cross-correlation is primarily due to the large scale structure of star forming galaxies, Taken in combination, our results suggest that Lya emitting galaxies contribute, but quasars dominate within 15 Mpc/h. A simple model for Lya emission from quasars based on hydrodynamic simulations reproduces both the observed forest-Lya emission and quasar-Lya emission signals. The latter is also consistent with extrapolation of observations of fluorescent emission from smaller scales r $\lt$ 1 Mpc.},

But in the context of the Quasar Main Sequence, high Eddington rate sources are those which have weak [O III] lines and strong Fe II lines. There is an overlap between the two populations, but they are not identical. Thus these two selection criteria give a different view on which objects are actually high Eddington ratio sources. We discuss this issue in the context of the broad band spectral energy density, emission line shape modeling, Fe II pseudo-continuum strength, and the level of X-ray variability. We also discuss the issue of the viewing angle and the insight one can gain from spectropolarimetric observations. We conclude that there is no single driver behind the Quasar Main Sequence, and the Eddington ratio of the source cannot be determined from the source location on the optical plane alone. On the other hand, an expected range of AGN parameters combined with a simple model of the Fe II production represent well the observed coverage pattern of the plane, with not much effect needed from the dispersion due to the viewing angle.},

  abstract      = {Recent multi-band variability studies have revealed that active galactic nucleus (AGN) accretion disk sizes are generally larger than the predictions of the classical thin disk by a factor of $2\sim 3$. This hints at some missing key ingredient in the classical thin disk theory, which is likely wind as we propose. For a given bolometric luminosity, in the outer part of an accretion disk, the effective temperature in the wind case is higher than that in the no-wind one.; meanwhile, the radial temperature profile of the wind case is flatter than the no-wind one. In presence of winds, for a given band, blackbody emission from large radii can contribute more to the observed luminosity than the no-wind case. Therefore, the disk sizes of the wind case can be larger than those of the no-wind case. We demonstrate that a model with the accretion rate scaling as $\dot{M}\_0 (R/R\_{\mathrm{S}})^{\beta}$ (i.e., the accretion rate declines with decreasing radius due to winds) can match both the inter-band time lags and the spectral energy distribution of NGC 5548. Our model can also explain the inter-band time lags of other sources. Therefore, our model can help decipher current and future continuum reverberation mapping observations.},

  abstract      = {Active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, driven by radiation pressure on dust, is an important mechanism for efficiently coupling the accreting black hole to the surrounding environment. Recent observations confirm that X-ray selected AGN samples respect the effective Eddington limit for dusty gas in the plane defined by the observed column density versus the Eddington ratio, the so-called $N\_{\rm H} - \lambda$ plane. A `forbidden' region occurs in this plane, where obscuring clouds cannot be long-lived, due to the action of radiation pressure on dust. Here we compute the effective Eddington limit by explicitly taking into account the trapping of reprocessed radiation (which has been neglected in previous works), and investigate its impact on the $N\_{\rm H} - \lambda$ plane. We show that the inclusion of radiation trapping leads to an enhanced forbidden region, such that even Compton-thick material can potentially be disrupted by sub-Eddington luminosities. We compare our model results to the most complete sample of local AGNs with measured X-ray properties, and find good agreement. Considering the anisotropic emission from the accretion disc, we also expect the development of dusty outflows along the polar axis, which may naturally account for the polar dust emission recently detected in several AGNs from mid-infrared observations. Radiative feedback thus appears to be the key mechanism regulating the obscuration properties of AGNs, and we discuss its physical implications in the context of co-evolution scenarios.},

We compare the model to the observed black hole mass function and the SMBH versus galaxy bulge stellar mass relation at $z=0$, and to the predicted bolometric, hard X-ray, soft X-ray and optical AGN luminosity functions to observations at $z \lt 6$, and find that the model is in good agreement with the observations. We employ this successful model to make predictions for the AGN luminosity function at $z \gt 6$ in the broadband filters of JWST, EUCLID and ATHENA. We predict that these three surveys will select three somewhat different samples of SMBHs, with EUCLID unveiling the more massive, high accretion rate SMBHs, JWST the less massive, lower accretion rate SMBHs and ATHENA covering objects inbetween. Overall, typical detected SMBHs will have masses, $M\_{\mathrm{BH}} \sim 10^{6-7} M\_{\odot}$, with dimensionless mass accretion rates, $\dot{M}/\dot{M}\_{\mathrm{Edd}} \sim 1-10$, in host galaxies of stellar mass, $M\_{\star} \sim 10^{8-9} M\_{\odot}$.

We also estimate lags using the $\backslash$texttt$\{$ICCF$\}$ software and find consistent results, though with larger uncertainties. Accretion-disk structure is fit using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, parameterizing the measured continuum lags as a function of disk size normalization, wavelength, black hole mass, and luminosity. In contrast with previous observations, our best-fit disk sizes and color profiles are consistent with the (Shakura $\backslash${\amp} Sunyaev 1973) analytic solution. We also find that more massive quasars have larger accretion disks, similarly consistent with the analytic accretion-disk model. The continuum lag fits have a large excess dispersion, indicating that our measured lag errors are underestimated and/or our best-fit model may be missing the effects of orientation, spin, and/or radiative efficiency. We demonstrate that fitting disk parameters using only the highest-SNR lag measurements biases best-fit disk sizes to be larger than the disk sizes recovered using a Bayesian approach on the full sample of well-defined lags. This work represents a significant advance in continuum reverberation mapping, providing a large number of accretion-disk size and structure measurements for quasars spanning a broad range of redshift, mass and luminosity.},

We find that the emissivity weighted distance from the central source of the Ly\_alpha, SiIV and CIII] line emitting regions are all similar, which corresponds to about twice that of the H\_beta region. We also find that 3/17 of our sources show an unexpected behavior in some emission lines, two in the Ly\_alpha light curve and one in the SiIV light curve, in that they do not seem to follow the variability of the UV continuum. Finally, we compute RM black hole masses for those quasars with highly significant lag measurements and compare them with CIV single--epoch (SE) mass determinations.

Although no clear relation is found between the star-formation rate of the host galaxies and the X-ray obscuration, we find a higher incidence of heavily-obscured quasars in disturbed/merging galaxies compared to the unobscured ones, thus possibly representing an earlier stage of evolution, after which the system is relaxing and becoming unobscured.},

  abstract     = {An accurate determination of the accretion history of the Universe requires both identifying obscured AGN and quantifying their level of obscuration.  To this end, our team has recently completed a 1.25 Msec Chandra X-ray Visionary Project named X-UDS, which aims to identify heavily obscured, ``Compton-thick'' AGN (CTAGN) via their X-ray spectral signatures out to z=2-3.  An essential component for this work is accurate spectroscopic redshifts, which are needed for both identifying CTAGN and our study of their host galaxies.  Our tests show that 36\% of our confirmed CTAGN would be missed if we relied on photometric redshifts alone.  Therefore, we propose for two-half nights of Keck MOSFIRE observations to obtain redshifts in support of our Chandra legacy survey.  Our proposed observations will increase by 4x our current sample of CTAGN at z 2.  We will use this increased sample to advance a wide range of research, including determining the X-ray luminosity function for CTAGN  at z 2, constraining the evolution of the CTAGN fraction with redshift, and determining the primary mechanism responsible for triggering obscured SMBH growth in the epoch when this growth is at its peak.},

  abstract      = {Previous studies suggest that the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may be fundamentally related to host-galaxy stellar mass (M$_{⋆}$). To investigate this SMBH growth-M$_{⋆}$ relation in detail, we calculate long-term SMBH accretion rate as a function of M$_{⋆}$ and redshift [$\backslash$overlineBHAR(M\_$\{$$\backslash$star $\}$, z)] over ranges of log (M$_{⋆}$/M$_{⊙}$) = 9.5-12 and z = 0.4-4. Our $\backslash$overlineBHAR(M\_$\{$$\backslash$star $\}$, z) is constrained by high-quality survey data (GOODS-South, GOODS-North and COSMOS), and by the stellar mass function and the X-ray luminosity function. At a given M$_{⋆}$, $\backslash$overlineBHAR is higher at high redshift. This redshift dependence is stronger in more massive systems [for log (M$_{⋆}$/M$_{⊙}$) {\ap} 11.5, $\backslash$overlineBHAR is three decades higher at z = 4 than at z = 0.5], possibly due to AGN feedback. Our results indicate that the ratio between $\backslash$overlineBHAR and average star formation rate ($\backslash$overlineSFR) rises towards high M$_{⋆}$ at a given redshift. This $\backslash$overlineBHAR/$\backslash$overlineSFR dependence on M$_{⋆}$ does not support the scenario that SMBH and galaxy growth are in lockstep. We calculate SMBH mass history [M$_{BH}$(z)] based on our $\backslash$overlineBHAR(M\_$\{$$\backslash$star $\}$, z) and the M$_{⋆}$(z) from the literature, and find that the M$_{BH}$-M$_{⋆}$ relation has weak redshift evolution since z {\ap} 2. The M$_{BH}$/M$_{⋆}$ ratio is higher towards massive galaxies: it rises from {\ap}1/5000 at log M$_{⋆}$ {\lsim} 10.5 to {\ap}1/500 at log M$_{⋆}$ {\gsim} 11.2. Our predicted M$_{BH}$/M$_{⋆}$ ratio at high M$_{⋆}$ is similar to that observed in local giant ellipticals, suggesting that SMBH growth from mergers is unlikely to dominate over growth from accretion.},

  abstract      = {Narrow-line Seyfert 1s (NLSy1s) are an ill-defined class. Work done over the past 20 years as well as recent analyses show a continuity in properties (e.g., Balmer line profiles, blueshifts of high-ionization lines) between sources with FWHM above and below 2000 km/s, the defining boundary of NLSy1s. This finding alone suggests that comparisons between samples of NLSy1s and rest of broad-line AGNs are most likely biased. NLSy1s can be properly contextualized by their location on the quasar main sequence originally defined by Sulentic et al 2000. At one end, NLSy1s encompass sources with strong FeII emission and associated with high Eddington ratio that hold the promise of becoming useful distance indicators; at the other end, at least some of them are sources with broad profiles seen face-on. Any rigid FWHM limit gives rise to some physical ambiguity, as the FWHM of low-ionization lines depends in a complex way on mass, Eddington ratio, orientation, and luminosity. In addition, if the scaling derived from luminosity and virial dynamics applies to the broad line regions, NLSy1s at luminosity higher than 1E47 erg/s become physically impossible. Therefore, in a broader context, a proper subdivision of two distinct classes of AGNs and quasars may be achieved by the distinction between Pop. A and B with boundary at = 4000 km/s in samples at z $\lt$ 1, or on the basis of spectrophotometric properties which may ultimately be related to differences in accretion modes if high-luminosity quasars are considered.},

Based on high-frequency radio observations at 37\~{}GHz, seven of them could host powerful, most likely relativistic jets. Host galaxy morphology studies of NLS1 galaxies are scarce, but exceedingly important for understanding the seemingly heterogeneous nature of the NLS1 population as well as their evolution and place in the active galactic nuclei (AGN) scheme. Increasing the sample size is essential for achieving statistically significant results. We determine the morphological types of the host galaxies by performing photometric decomposition of NIR images using a 2D image decomposition algorithm GALFIT. We were able to sufficiently model five of the nine host galaxies. Based on the fitting parameters, mainly the S$\backslash$'$\{$e$\}$rsic index, all of them are disk-like galaxies. Sources with clearly distinguishable bulge components all have pseudo-bulges, and four out of five sources show a component resembling a bar. A surprisingly large fraction, three out of five, show signs of interaction or disturbed morphology. Our results suggest that spiral galaxies with pseudo-bulges are able to launch and maintain powerful jets. They also imply that interaction - mainly minor mergers - may have a role in initially triggering higher levels of nuclear activity in NLS1 galaxies. Furthermore, our results support the heterogeneous nature of the NLS1 class and indicate that this diversity is caused by different evolutionary stages, possibly due to mergers.},

We also find that the X-ray obscuration in BLAGN tends to coincide with optical dust extinction, which is optically thinner than that in narrow-line AGN (NLAGN) and likely partial-covering to the broad line region. All the results can be explained in the framework of a multi-component, clumpy torus model by interpreting BLAGN2 as an intermediate type between BLAGN1 and NLAGN in terms of an intermediate inclination angle.},

  abstract      = {While there are numerous criteria for photometrically identifying active galactic nuclei (AGNs), searches in the optical and UV tend to exclude galaxies that are highly dust obscured. This is problematic for constraining models of AGN evolution and estimating the AGN contribution to the cosmic X-ray and IR backgrounds, as highly obscured objects tend to be underrepresented in large-scale surveys. To address this, we identify potentially obscured AGNs using mid-IR color colors from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) catalog. This paper presents the results of optical spectroscopy of obscured AGN candidates using Keck DEIMOS, and their physical properties derived from these spectra. We find that a $W1-W2\gt0.8$ color criterion effectively selects AGNs with a higher median level of $E(B-V)$ extinction compared to the AGNs found in the SDSS DR7 survey. This optical extinction can be measured using SED modeling or by using $r-W1$ as a measure of optical to IR flux. We find that specific, targeted observations are necessary to find the most highly optically obscured AGNs, and that additional far-IR photometry is necessary to further constrain the dust properties of these AGNs.},

Further, strong thermal and non-thermal components simultaneously present in their spectral energy distributions (SEDs), shed new light on the jet-disk connection at much shorter timescales, given their low SMBH masses. While NLS1 galaxies have been studied thoroughly at optical and X-ray energies for decades, the populations of radio-loud, and $\gamma$-ray emitting NLS1 galaxies have only emerged more recently. This contribution provides a short review of the multi-wavelength properties of this intriguing class of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), including X-ray variability and emission mechanisms, $\gamma$-ray discoveries, spectral energy distributions (SEDs), star formation activity, host galaxy morphologies, different methods of black hole mass estimation, (unexpected) FeII properties, and high-velocity large-scale outflows possibly driven by the radio jet and with a surprisingly pronounced ionization stratification.},

In three of these systems we detect wavelength-dependent microlensing, which we use to place constraints on the sizes and temperature profiles of the accretion discs in each quasar. Accretion disc radius is assumed to vary with wavelength according to the power-law relationship $r\propto \lambda^p$, equivalent to a radial temperature profile of $T\propto r^{-1/p}$. The goal of this work is to search for deviations from standard thin disc theory, which predicts that radius goes as wavelength to the power $p=4/3$. We find a wide range of power-law indices, from $p=1.4^{+0.5}\_{-0.4}$ in B 1422+231 to $p=2.3^{+0.5}\_{-0.4}$ in WFI J2026-4536. The measured value of $p$ appears to correlate with the strength of the wavelength-dependent microlensing. We explore this issue with mock simulations using a fixed accretion disc with $p=1.5$, and find that cases where wavelength-dependent microlensing is small tend to under-estimate the value of $p$. This casts doubt on previous ensemble single-epoch measurements which have favoured low values using samples of lensed quasars that display only moderate chromatic effects. Using only our systems with strong chromatic microlensing we prefer $p\gt4/3$, corresponding to shallower temperature profiles than expected from standard thin disc theory.},

Such discs are long known to have difficulty explaining the observed optical/UV emission from active galactic nuclei. Here we show that alternative models developed to explain these observations have larger scale heights and shorter inflow times. Accretion discs supported by magnetic pressure in particular are geometrically thick at all luminosities, with inflow times as short as the observed few year timescales in extreme variability events to date. Future time-resolved, multi-wavelength observations can distinguish between inflow through a geometrically thick disc as proposed here, and alternative scenarios of extreme reprocessing of a central source or instability-driven limit cycles.},

Next-generation 21cm surveys are promising to break degeneracies between a broad range of reionization models, hence revealing the nature of the source population. While many current efforts are focused on a measurement of the 21cm power spectrum, some surveys will also image the 21cm field during reionization. This provides further information with which to determine the nature of reionizing sources. We create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that is efficiently able to distinguish between 21cm maps that are produced by AGN versus galaxies scenarios with an accuracy of 92-100\%, depending on redshift and neutral fraction range. When adding thermal noise from typical 21cm experiments, the classification accuracy depends strongly on the effectiveness of foreground removal. Our results show that if foregrounds can be removed reasonably well, both SKA and HERA should be able to discriminate between source models with greater accuracy than using the power spectrum alone.},

Our analysis of 27 composite spectra from the BOSS survey indicates that the redshift and the broadening of the lines in the Fe III$\lambda\lambda$2039-2113 blend roughly follow the expected correlation in the weak limit of Schwarzschild geometry for virialized kinematics. Assuming that the Fe III UV redshift provides a measure of $M\_{BH}\over R$ (${\Delta \lambda\over \lambda}\simeq{3\over2}{G\over c^2} {M\_{BH}\over R}$) and using different estimates of the emitting region size, $R$ (either from gravitational microlensing, reverberation mapping or from the scaling of size with intrinsic quasar luminosity), we obtain masses for 10 objects which are in agreement within uncertainties with previous mass estimates based on the virial theorem. Reverberation mapping estimates of the size of the Fe III$\lambda\lambda$2039-2113 emitting region in a sample of objects would be needed to confirm the gravitational origin of the measured redshifts.

The Eddington ratio ($\lambda\_{Edd}$), which measures the accretion rate, is also known to be related with outflow and emission-line properties in the general quasar population. Moreover, models describing quasar accretion depend on $\lambda\_{Edd}$, which can thus possibly affect the relative production of accelerating UV and ionizing EUV/X-ray radiation. In this work, for the first time, we investigated whether BALQSO X-ray properties are related with the Eddington ratio. We selected a sample of 30 BALQSOs with accurate measurements of black-hole mass and BAL properties from the literature, and we complemented it with 4 additional BALQSOs we observed with $\backslash$xmm$\backslash$, to populate the low and high Eddington-ratio regimes. We did not find evidence for a strong relation between $\lambda\_{Edd}$ and X-ray suppression, which however shows a significant correlation with the strength of the UV absorption features. These findings are confirmed also by considering a sample of mini-BALQSOs collected from the literature.},

  abstract      = {We present a robust census of ionized gas outflows in normal galaxies at 0.6$\lt$z$\lt$2.7 with 9.0$\lt$log(M*/Msun)$\lt$11.7. The sample of 599 objects fairly homogeneously covers the main sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies, and probes into the regimes of quiescent galaxies and starburst outliers. The data are mostly from the KMOS\^{}3D survey, with deep, integral field spectroscopy of the Ha, [NII], and [SII] line emission. About 1/3 of the sample exhibits outflows, roughly equally split into winds driven by star formation (SF) and by active galactic nuclei (AGN). The incidence of SF-driven winds correlates mainly with star formation properties. These outflows have a typical velocity of \~{}450 km/s and local electron density of n\_e \~{} 380 cm\^{}-3, leading to modest mass loading factors of \~{} 0.1-0.2 at all galaxy masses. Their energetics are compatible with momentum driving by the young stellar populations. The SF-driven winds may escape only from log(M*/Msun) $\lt$ 10.3 galaxies. Faster AGN-driven outflows (\~{}1000-2000 km/s) are detected above log(M*/Msun)\~{}10.7, in up to \~{}75\% of galaxies at log(M*/Msun)$\gt$11.2, and are roughly twice as common as X-ray detected AGN. The incidence, strength, and velocity of AGN-driven winds strongly correlates with stellar mass and central concentration. Their outflowing ionized gas appears to be denser (n\_e \~{} 1000 cm\^{}-3), and possibly compressed and shock-excited by hotter wind fluid. These winds have comparable inferred mass loading factors as the SF-driven winds but carry roughly 10 times more momentum and 50 times more energy. The results robustly confirm our previous findings of high duty cycle, energy-driven outflows powered by AGN above the Schechter mass, which may contribute to quench star formation in high mass galaxies at the peak epoch of galaxy formation.

Our main goals are (1) to determine the black hole masses from continuum-Hbeta reverberation signatures, and (2) to look for velocity-dependent time delays that might be indicators of the gross kinematics of the broad-line region. We successfully measure Hbeta time delays and black hole masses for five AGNs, four of which have previous reverberation mass measurements. The values measured here are in agreement with earlier estimates, though there is some intrinsic scatter beyond the formal measurement errors. We observe velocity dependent Hbeta lags in each case, and find that the patterns have changed in the intervening five years for three AGNs that were also observed in 2007.},

  abstract      = {The physics behind the dramatic and unpredictable X-ray variability of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) has eluded astronomers since it was discovered. We present an analysis of Swift XRT observations of 44 AGN with at least 20 Swift observations. We define HR-slope as the change of Hardness Ratio (HR) with luminosity ($L$). This slope is measured for all objects in order to: 1. Classify different AGN according to their HR-HR-slope relation and 2. compare HR-$L/L\_\mathrm{Edd}$ trends with those observed in X-ray binaries for the 27 AGN with well measured black hole masses. We compare results using a count-based HR definition and an energy-based HR definition. We observe a clear dichotomy between Seyferts and radio loud galaxies when considering count-based HR, which disappears when considering energy based HR. This, along with the fact no correlation is observed between HR parameters and radio loudness, implies radio loud and radio quiet AGN should not be discriminated by their HR behavior. We provide schematic physical models to explain the observed transition between energy defined HR states. We find Seyferts populate the high, hard, phase of the HR-$L/L\_\mathrm{Edd}$ diagram as well as do three radio loud objects. Two LINERs populate the low, soft, phase part of this diagram. Finally, radio loud objects are concentrated around small positive HR-slopes, while Seyferts track the HR phase diagram which may provide clues to the geometry of the corona.},

  abstract      = {Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) are generally believed to be radio-quiet Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with relatively less-massive (10$^{5}$$-$10$^{8}$\~{}M$\_{\odot}$) Super-Massive Black Holes (SMBH). Using the FIRST radio detections of hitherto the largest sample of 11101 optically-selected NLS1s we find a rather uncommon population of 55 NLS1s with Kiloparsec-Scale Radio structures (KSRs). We note that the number of NLS1s with KSRs found in our study is only a lower limit considering the effects of sensitivity, spatial resolution and projection, and hence, the number of NLS1s with KSRs may be more common than thought earlier. The NLS1s with KSRs are distributed across a wide range of redshifts, flux densities and luminosities. NLS1s with KSRs tend to exhibit steep radio spectra and are likely to be misaligned version of blazar-like NLS1s. The ratio of IR to radio flux density (q$\_{\rm 22~{\mu}m}$ $=$ log[S$\_{\rm 22~{\mu}m}$/S$\_{\rm 1.4~GHz}$]) versus radio luminosity plot suggests that KSRs are mostly powered by AGN, while KSRs in NLS1s with low radio luminosity (L$\_{\rm 1.4~GHz}$ $\lt$ 10$^{23.5}$ W\~{}Hz$^{-1}$) may have a contribution from circumnuclear starburst. The trend shown by KSRs in radio luminosity versus radio-size plot indicates that the radio-jets resulting in KSRs are either in the early phase of their evolution or inefficient to grow beyond the host galaxy.},

  abstract      = {We present the discovery of a gravitationally lensed dust-reddened QSO at $z=2.517$ discovered in a survey for red QSOs by infrared selection. $Hubble~Space~Telescope$ imaging in the WFC3/IR F160W and F125W filters reveals a quadruply lensed system in a cusp configuration. We find that compared to the central image of the cusp, the nearby, brightest image is anomalous by a factor of $\sim7-11$. Although the source is extremely bright in the mid-infrared, a magnification by a factor of $\sim50-120$ places an upper limit of 1.35 mJy on the intrinsic mid-infrared brightness, well below the $WISE~W4$ detection limit of 6 mJy. We find that this QSO is moderately reddened, with $E(B-V)=0.7$ and that $\sim1\\%$ of the intrinsic spectrum is leaked back into the line of sight resulting in an upturn in its UV spectrum. We conclude that the QSO's reddening is intrinsic and not due to the lens. Consistent with previous red quasar samples, this source exhibits outflows in its spectrum as well as morphological properties suggestive of it being in a merger-driven transitional phase. Depending on how $L\_{\rm bol}$ is computed, the quasar's accretion rate may be as high as $0.26~L\_{\rm Edd}$. We detect two Lyman limit systems, at $z=2.102$ and $z=2.431$, with absorption by metal lines likely at small impact parameter to the QSO, and a putative lens redshift of $z=0.599$. Given the rarity of quad lenses, the discovery of this source allows detailed study of a less luminous, more typical infrared-selected quasar at high redshift.},

At the achieved resolutions of 1.1`` to 1.2'' (or 7.5 to 8.2 kpc), the continuum at 205 and 372 um (rest-frame), the CO (7-6), and the [CI] emissions are at best barely resolved whereas the [NII] emission is well resolved with an ALMA beam de-convolved major axis of 1.3`` (+/- 0.3'') or 9 (+/-2) kpc. As a warm dense gas tracer, the CO (7-6) emission shows a more compact spatial distribution and a significantly higher peak velocity dispersion than the other two lines that probe lower density gas, a picture favoring a merger-triggered star formation (SF) scenario over an orderly rotating SF disk. The CO (7-6) data also indicate a possible QSO-driven gas outflow that reaches a maximum line-of-sight velocity of 500 to 600 km/s. The far-infrared (FIR) dust temperature (T\_dust) of 41.5 K from a gray-body fit to the continuum agrees well with the average T\_dust inferred from various line luminosity ratios. The resulting L\_CO(7-6)/L\_FIR luminosity ratio is consistent with that of local luminous infrared galaxies powered predominantly by SF. The CO(7-6) luminosity-inferred SF rate is 5.1 (+/-1.5) x 10\^{}3 M\_solar/yr . The system has an effective star-forming region of 1.7 (+1.7/-0.8) kpc in diameter and a molecular gas reservoir of \~{}5 x 10\^{}$\{$11$\}$ M\_solar.},

  abstract      = {Most of the radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies resemble compact steep-spectrum sources. However, the extremely radio-loud ones show blazar-like characteristics, like flat radio spectra, compact radio cores, substantial variability and high brightness temperatures. These objects are thought to be similar to blazars as they possess relativistic jets seen at small angle to the line of sight. This claim has been further supported by the Fermi satellite discovery of gamma-ray emission from a handful of these sources. Using the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) data, we analyzed the mid-infrared variability characteristics of $42$ radio-loud NLS1 at $3.4$ and $4.6\,\mu$m. We found that $27$ out of the studied $42$ sources showed variability in at least one of the two infrared bands. In some cases, significant changes in the infrared colors can alter the location of the source in the WISE color-color diagram which might lead to different classification. More than $60$\% of the variable sources also showed variability within a $1-1.5$ day interval. Such short time scales argue for a compact emission region like those associated with the jets. This connection is further strengthened by the fact that the brightest $\gamma$-ray emitters of the sample ($6$ sources), all showed short time scale infrared variability.},

We measure sample-averaged SMBH accretion rate ($\overline{\mathrm{BHAR}}$) from X-ray observations, and study its dependence on overdensity and cosmic-web environment at different redshifts while controlling for galaxy stellar mass ($M\_\star$). Our results show that $\overline{\mathrm{BHAR}}$ does not significantly depend on overdensity or cosmic-web environment once $M\_\star$ is controlled, indicating that environment-related physical mechanisms (e.g. tidal interaction and ram-pressure stripping) might not significantly affect SMBH growth.

The aim of our study is to use astrometric and mid-infrared methods to select quasars and get a reliable quasar candidates catalog. Methods. We used a near-zero proper motion criterion in conjuction with WISE (all-sky Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer) [W1-W2] color to select quasar candidates. The [W1-W2] color criterion is defined by the linear boundary of two samples: LAMOST DR5 quasars, which serve as the quasar sample, and LAMOST DR5 stars and galaxies, which serve as the non-quasar sample. The contamination and completeness are evaluated. Results. We present a catalog of 662 753 quasar candidates, with a completeness of about 75\% and a reliability of 77.2\%.},

  abstract      = {We investigate the clustering and dark halo properties for the narrow-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the SDSS, particularly examining the joint dependence on galaxy mass and color. AGN in galaxies with blue colors or massive red galaxies with M*$\gt$\~{}10\^{}$\{$10.5$\}$Msun are found to show almost identical clustering amplitudes at all scales to control galaxies of the same mass, color and structural parameters. This suggests AGN activity in blue galaxies or massive red galaxies is regulated by internal processes, with no correlation with environment. The antibias of AGN at scales between \~{}100kpc and a few Mpc, as found in Li et al. (2006) for the AGN as a whole, is observed only for the AGN hosted by galaxies with red colors and relatively low masses $\lt$10\^{}$\{$10.5$\}$Msun. A simple halo model in which AGN are preferentially found at dark halo centers can reproduce the observational results, but requiring a mass-dependent central fraction which is a factor of \~{}4 higher than the fraction estimated from the SDSS group catalogue. The same group catalogue reveals that the host groups of AGN in red satellites tend to have lower halo masses than control galaxies, while the host groups of AGN in red centrals tend to form earlier, as indicated by a larger stellar mass gap between the two most massive galaxies in the groups. Our result implies that the mass assembly history of dark halos may play an additional role in the AGN activity in low-mass red galaxies.},

We use data obtained from the AstroSat satellite along with the light curves obtained from XMM-Newton and Swift-XRT. We use the 0.3 - 7.0 keV and 3 - 20 keV data, respectively, from the SXT and the LAXPC of AstroSat. The X-ray spectra in the 0.3 - 20 keV region are well fit with a model consisting of a power-law and a soft excess described by a thermal-Compton emission with a large optical depth, consistent with the earlier reported results. We have examined the X-ray light curves in the soft and hard X-ray bands of SXT and LAXPC, respectively, and find that the variability is slightly larger in the hard band. To investigate the variability characteristics of this source at different time scales, we have used X-ray light curves obtained from XMM-Newton data (200 s to 100 ks range) and Swift-XRT data (1 day to 100 day range) and find that there are evidences to suggest that the variability sharply increases at longer time scales. We argue that the mass of the black hole in RE J1034+396 is likely to be $\sim$3 $\times$ 10$^6$ M$\_\odot$, based on the similarity of the observed QPO to the high frequency QPO seen in the Galactic black hole binary, GRS 1915+105.},

  abstract      = {We report the initial result of an adaptive-optics assisted, optical integral-field-unit observation on IRAS04576+0912, the nearest (z=0.039) active galactic nucleus with a prominent blueshift/tail in [O III] emission from a sample of such objects that we have collected from the literature. We aim at addressing the putative quasar-mode feedback process with Subaru/Kyoto 3D II+AO188. The optical waveband (6400--7500 AA) enables us to measure the gas density via the [S II] doublets, in contrast to earlier Near-IR studies. Since the fast [O III] outflow happens only around rapidly growing central black holes, this object is suitable for investigating the black hole-galaxy coevolution. The obtained data cube exhibits blue tail in the [S II] emission at many lenslets. By fitting the spectrum with the high excess flux at the [S II] blue tail, we find the fast (\~{} 860 km/s), dense ($\gt$3000/cc), wide-angle and offset outflow in central 100-pc scales. Although the large opening angle and the high gas outflow-to-accretion ratio may favour the feedback hypothesis, the inferred kinetic power injection rate of this ionized gas outflow seems insufficient to influence the whole host galaxy. A conventional assumption of a low density must have overestimated the feedback process.},

The quasars J0906+6930 at redshift z=5.47 and J2102+6015 at z=4.57 stand out from the known sample with their compact emission on milliarcsecond (mas) angular scale with high (0.1-Jy level) flux densities measured at GHz radio frequencies. This makes them ideal targets for very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations. Aims. By means of VLBI imaging we can reveal the inner radio structure of quasars and model their brightness distribution to better understand the geometry of the jet and the physics of the sources. Methods. We present sensitive high-resolution VLBI images of J0906+6930 and J2102+6015 at two observing frequencies, 2.3 and 8.6 GHz. The data were taken in an astrometric observing programme involving a global five-element radio telescope array. We combined the data from five different epochs from 2017 February to August. Results. For one of the highest redshift blazars known, J0906+6930, we present the first-ever VLBI image obtained at a frequency below 8 GHz. Based on our images at 2.3 and 8.6 GHz, we confirm that this source has a sharply bent helical inner jet structure within \~{}3 mas from the core. The quasar J2102+6015 shows an elongated radio structure in the east-west direction within the innermost \~{}2 mas that can be described with a symmetric three-component brightness distribution model at 8.6 GHz. Because of their non-pointlike mas-scale structure, these sources are not ideal as astrometric reference objects. Our results demonstrate that VLBI observing programmes conducted primarily with astrometric or geodetic goals can be utilized for astrophysical purposes as well.},

  abstract      = {Our view of the central regions of AGN has been enriched by the discovery of fast and massive outflows of HI and molecular gas. Here we present a brief summary of results obtained for young (and restarted) radio AGN. We find that HI outflows tend to be particularly common in this group of objects. This supports the idea that the jet, expanding in a clumpy medium, plays a major role in driving these outflows. The clumpiness of the medium is confirmed by VLBI and ALMA observations. The HI observations reveal that, at least part of the gas, is distributed in clouds with sizes up to a few tens of pc and mass \~{}10\^{}4 Msun. A change of the conditions in the outflow, with an increasing fraction of diffuse components, as the radio jets grow, is suggested by the high resolution HI observations. The molecular gas completes the picture, showing that the radio plasma jet can couple well with the ISM, strongly affecting the kinematics, but also the physical conditions of the molecular gas. This is confirmed by numerical simulations reproducing, to first order, the kinematics of the gas.},

During this period, we find two notable $\gamma$-ray events: an exceptionally strong outburst followed by a significant enhancement (local peak). In this study, we analyze multi-waveband light curves (radio, optical, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray) plus very-long baseline interferometry (VLBI) data to investigate the nature of the $\gamma$-ray events. The $\gamma$-ray outburst coincides with flux maxima at longer wavelengths. We find a spectral hardening of the $\gamma$-ray photon index during the $\gamma$-ray outburst. The photon index shows a transition from a softer-when-brighter to a harder-when-brighter trend at around 1.8 $\times$ $10^{-7}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. We see indication that both the $\gamma$-ray outburst and the subsequent enhancement precede the propagation of a polarized knot in a region near the VLBI core. The highest polarized intensity, 230$\backslash$,mJy, and an electric vector position angle rotation, by $\sim$32$^{\circ}$, are detected about 12 days after the $\gamma$-ray outburst. We conclude that both $\gamma$-ray events are caused by the propagation of a disturbance in the mm-wave core.},

  abstract      = {Radio loud Active Galactic Nuclei are episodic in nature, cycling through periods of activity and quiescence. In this work we investigate the duty cycle of the radio galaxy B2\~{}0258+35, which was previously suggested to be a restarted radio galaxy based on its morphology. The radio source consists of a pair of kpc-scale jets embedded in two large-scale lobes (\~{}240 kpc) with relaxed shape and very low surface brightness, which resemble remnants of a past AGN activity. We combine new LOFAR data at 145 MHz and new SRT data at 6600 MHz with available WSRT data at 1400 MHz to investigate the spectral properties of the outer lobes and derive their age. Interestingly, the spectrum of both the outer Northern and Southern lobes is not ultra-steep as expected for an old ageing plasma with spectral index values equal to $\rm \alpha\_{1400}^{145}=0.48\pm0.11$ and $\rm \alpha\_{6600}^{1400}=0.69\pm0.20$ in the outer Northern lobe, and $\rm \alpha\_{1400}^{145}=0.73\pm0.07$ in the outer Southern lobe. Moreover, despite the wide frequency coverage available for the outer Northern lobe (145-6600\~{}MHz), we do not identify a significant spectral curvature (SPC$\simeq$0.2$\pm0.2$). While mechanisms such as in-situ particle reacceleration, mixing or compression can temporarily play a role in preventing the spectrum from steepening, in no case seem the outer lobes to be compatible with being very old remnants of past activity as previously suggested (with age $\gtrsim$ 80 Myr). We conclude that either the large-scale lobes are still fuelled by the nuclear engine or the jets have switched off no more than a few tens of Myr ago. Our study shows the importance of combining morphological and spectral properties to reliably classify the evolutionary stage of low surface brightness, diffuse emission that low frequency observations are revealing around a growing number of radio sources.},

  abstract     = {We isolate a set of quasars that exhibit emergent C iv broad absorption lines (BALs) in their spectra by comparing spectra in the SDSS Data Release 7 and the SDSS/BOSS Data Releases 9 and 10. After visually defining a set of emergent BALs, follow-up observations were obtained with the Gemini Observatory for 105 quasars. We find an emergence rate consistent with the previously reported disappearance rate of BAL quasars given the relative numbers of non-BAL and BAL quasars in the SDSS. We find candidate newly emerged BALs are preferentially drawn from among BALs with smaller balnicity indices, shallower depths, larger velocities, and smaller widths. Within two rest-frame years (average) after a BAL has emerged, we find it equally likely to continue increasing in equivalent width in an observation six months later (average) as it is to start decreasing. From the time separations between our observations, we conclude the coherence time-scale of BALs is less than 100 rest-frame days. We observe coordinated variability among pairs of troughs in the same quasar, likely due to clouds at different velocities responding to the same changes in ionizing flux; and the coordination is stronger if the velocity separation between the two troughs is smaller. We speculate the latter effect may be due to clouds having on average lower densities at higher velocities due to mass conservation in an accelerating flow, causing the absorbing gas in those clouds to respond on different timescales to the same ionizing flux variations.},

  abstract    = {We have carried out a systematic X-ray spectral analysis of a sample of low luminosity quasars (LLQSO) to investigate the nature of the central engines of these sources. The optically-selected LLQSO sample consists of close, known bright active galactic nuclei (AGN) which serves as an important link between the powerful quasars at higher redshift and local Seyfert galaxies. We find that although the bolometric luminosities of the LLQSOs are lower than those of the higher redshift quasars by almost an order of magnitude, their distribution of the Eddington rate $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ is similar. We detect a strong anti-correlation between $\alpha_{\rm OX}$ and $L_{2500 \rm \AA}$, as has also been detected in several other quasar studies with large sample sizes, indicating that as the UV luminosity of the source increases, the X-ray luminosity decreases. We do not detect any significant neutral obscuration ($N_{\rm H} \ge10^{22}\, \rm cm^{-2}$) in the X-ray spectra of the LLQSOs, and hence rule out obscuration as a possible cause for their lower luminosity. We conclude that the central engines of the LLQSOs function similarly to those of the higher redshift quasars, and the difference is possibly because of the fact that the LLQSOs have lower black hole masses. We do not find any correlation between the molecular gas in the host galaxies and accretion states of the AGN. This indicates that the presence of molecular gas in the host galaxies of the LLQSOs does not significantly influence the instantaneous accretion rates of their SMBHs.},

  abstract      = {Recently Assef et al.(2018) presented two catalogs of AGN candidates over 30,093 deg\^{}2 selected from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) observations. From their most reliable sample, Assef et al. (2018) identified 45 AGN candidates with the highest variability levels in the AllWISE catalog, but that are not blazars. Here we present new spectroscopic observations of some of these targets to further constrain their nature. We also study their optical lightcurves using observations from CRTS, and find that only seven show significant optical variability, and that five of those seven are spectroscopically classified as AGN. In one of them, WISEA J094806.56+031801.7 (W0948+0318), we identify a transient event in the CRTS lightcurve. We present a detailed analysis of this transient, and characterize it through its CRTS lightcurve and its multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution obtained from GALEX, Pan-STARRS and WISE observations. We find that the most likely source of the transient is a super-luminous supernova (SLSN) in W0948+0318. We estimate the total radiated energy to be E=1.6$\backslash$pm 0.3 x 10\^{}52 erg, making it one of the most energetic SLSN observed. Based on the lack of change in mid-IR color throughout and after the transient event, we speculate that the location of the SLSN is within the torus of the AGN. We identify 9 possible analogs to W0948+0318 based on their WISE lightcurves. None show optically detected transients and hence suggest significant dust obscuration. Finally, we estimate a rate of $\gt$2x10\^{}-7 yr\^{}-1 per AGN for these transients under the conservative assumption that none of the identified analogs have a common origin with the transient in W0948+0318.},

  abstract      = {Energetic gas outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are considered as one of the mechanisms, by which supermassive black holes affect their host galaxies. To probe the impact of AGN-driven outflows, it is essential to quantify the size of the region under the influence of outflows. In the third of a series of papers, we present the spatially-resolved kinematics of ionized gas for 3 additional type 2 AGNs based on the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) integral field spectroscopy. Along with the 6 AGNs presented in our previous works and the 14 AGNs with available GMOS IFU data, we construct a sample of 23 luminous type 2 AGNs at z $\lt$ 0.2, and kinematically measure the size of ionized gas outflows by tracing the radial decrease of the velocity dispersion of the [O iii] $\{$$\backslash$lambda$\}$5007 emission line. The kinematically-measured outflow size ranges from 0.60 to \~{}7.45 kpc, depending on AGN luminosity. We find that the size of the photoionized region is larger than the kinematically-measured outflow size, while the flux-weighted photoionization size is significantly smaller. Thus, using the photoionization size as a proxy for the outflow size will lead to overestimation or underestimation, and introduce a large uncertainty of the mass outflow rate and the energy output rate. We report the outflow size-luminosity relation with a slope of 0.28$\{$$\backslash$pm$\}$0.03, which is shallower than the slope of the correlation between the photoionization size and luminosity.},

  abstract      = {We show how the XXL multiwavelength survey can be used to shed light on radio galaxies and their environment. Two prominent radio galaxies were identified in a visual examination of the mosaic of XXL-North obtained with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope at 610MHz. Counterparts were searched for in other bands. Spectroscopic redshifts from the GAMA database were used to identify clusters and/or groups of galaxies, estimate their masses with the caustic method, and quantify anisotropies in the surrounding galaxy distribution via a Fourier analysis. Both radio galaxies are of FR I type and are hosted by early-type galaxies at a redshift of 0.138. The first radio source, named the Exemplar, has a physical extent of about 400 kpc; it is located in the cluster XLSSC112, which has a temperature of about 2 keV, a total mass of about $10^{14} M\_\odot$, and resides in an XXL supercluster with eight known members. The second source, named the Double Irony, is a giant radio galaxy with a total length of about 1.1 Mpc. Its core coincides with a cataloged point-like X-ray source, but no extended X-ray emission from a surrounding galaxy cluster was detected. However, from the optical data we determined that the host is the brightest galaxy in a group that is younger, less virialized, and less massive than the Exemplar's cluster. A friends-of-friends analysis showed that the Double Irony's group is a member of the same supercluster as the Exemplar. There are indications that the jets and plumes of the Double Irony have been deflected by gas associated with the surrounding galaxy distribution. Another overdensity of galaxies (the tenth) containing a radio galaxy was found to be associated with the supercluster. Radio galaxies can be used to find galaxy clusters/groups that are below the current sensitivity of X-ray surveys.},

The dependence broadly supports the proposed ``shielding'' model for WLQs, in which a geometrically and optically thick inner accretion disk, expected for a quasar accreting at a high Eddington ratio, both prevents ionizing EUV/X-ray photons from reaching the high-ionization broad emission-line region and also sometimes blocks the line-of-sight to the central X-ray emitting region. This model is also supported by the hard average spectral shape of X-ray weak WLQs (with a power-law effective photon index of $\Gamma\_{\rm eff}=1.19^{+0.56}\_{-0.45}$). Additionally, we have examined UV continuum/emission-line properties that might trace X-ray weakness among WLQs, confirming that red UV continuum color is the most-effective tracer.},

  abstract      = {Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) are a class of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Their physical properties can be either interpreted in terms of evolution, suggesting that they are a young phase of AGN life, or inclination, under the hypothesis of a disk-like broad-line region observed pole-on. To distinguish between these two hypotheses, host galaxy morphology is a very helpful tool because it can provide an independent estimate of the black hole mass. In this work we present the results of a morphological analysis of the host galaxy of the radio-loud NLS1 IRAS 20181-2244 observed with the 6.5m Baade Telescope of the Las Campanas Observatory. The GALFIT analysis ran on the Ks image, along with additional spectroscopic observations performed with the Nordic Optical Telescope, clearly revealed the presence of an interacting system of two disk galaxies. The presence of a disk hosting this NLS1 is supportive of the evolutionary hypothesis. This analysis, along with other results presented in the literature, might suggest that two subclasses of radio-loud NLS1 exist. One represents the young evolutionary phase of AGN life, and the other is observed pole-on. Further morphological studies are needed to discern between the two groups.},

We combine new rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) spectra of two radio-quiet type-2 AGNs obtained with FOCAS on the Subaru Telescope with existing rest-frame UV emission lines, i.e., CIV1549, HeII1640, and CIII]1909, of a sample of 16 HzRGs and 6 additional X-ray selected type-2 AGNs, whose host stellar masses have been estimated in literature. We divided our sample in three stellar mass bins and calculated averaged emission-line flux ratios of CIV1549/HeII1640 and CIII]1909/CIV1549. Comparing observed emission-line flux ratios with photoionization model predictions, we estimated narrow line region (NLR) metallicities for each mass bin. We found that there is a positive correlation between NLR metallicities and stellar masses of type-2 AGNs at z \~{} 3. This is the first indication that AGN metallicities are related to their hosts, i.e., stellar mass. Since NLR metallicities and stellar masses follow a similar relation as the MZR in star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts, our results indicate that NLR metallicities are related to those of the host galaxies. This study highlights the importance of considering lower-mass X-ray selected AGNs in addition to radio galaxies to explore the metallicity properties of NLRs at high redshift.},

The source flux shows modest variability within each pointing and among the four observations. Spectra are well modelled in terms of a weakly variable primary power law with constant photon index ($\Gamma$=2.01$\pm$0.08). A constant narrow $\backslash$ion$\{$Fe$\}$ K$\alpha$ emission line suggests that this feature has an origin far from the central black hole, while a broad relativistic component is not required by the data. The Compton reflection component is also constant in flux with a corresponding reflection fraction R=0.7$^{+0.2}\_{-0.3}$. The iron abundance is compatible with being Solar (A$\_{Fe}$=1.2$^{+1.4}\_{-0.4}$), and a lower limit for the high energy cut-off E$\_c$$\gt$280 keV is obtained. Adopting a self-consistent model accounting for a primary Comptonized continuum, we obtain a lower limit for the hot corona electron temperature kT$\_e$$\gt$65 keV and a corresponding upper limit for the coronal optical depth of $\tau\_e$$\lt$1.3. The results of the present analysis are consistent with the locus of local Seyfert galaxies in the kT$\_e$-$\tau\_e$ and temperature-compactness diagrams.},

  abstract      = {Determinations of the UV luminosity function of AGN at high redshifts are important for constraining the AGN contribution to reionization and understanding the growth of supermassive black holes. Recent inferences of the luminosity function suffer from inconsistencies arising from inhomogeneous selection and analysis of AGN data. We address this problem by constructing a sample of more than 80,000 colour-selected AGN from redshift z=0 to 7.5. While this sample is composed of multiple data sets with spectroscopic redshifts and completeness estimates, we homogenise these data sets to identical cosmologies, intrinsic AGN spectra, and magnitude systems. Using this sample, we derive the AGN UV luminosity function from redshift z=0 to 7.5. The luminosity function has a double power law form at all redshifts. The break magnitude $M\_*$ of the AGN luminosity function shows a steep brightening from $M\_*\sim -24$ at z=0.7 to $M\_*\sim -29$ at z=6. The faint-end slope $\beta$ significantly steepens from $-1.7$ at $z\lt2.2$ to $-2.4$ at $z\simeq 6$. In spite of this steepening, the contribution of AGN to the hydrogen photoionization rate at $z\sim 6$ is subdominant ($\lt$ 3\%), although it can be non-negligible (\~{}10\%) if these luminosity functions hold down to $M\_{1450}=-18$. Under reasonable assumptions, AGN can reionize HeII by redshift z=2.9. At low redshifts (z$\lt$0.5), AGN can produce about half of the hydrogen photoionization rate inferred from the statistics of HI absorption lines in the IGM. Our global analysis of the luminosity function also reveals important systematic errors in the data, particularly at z=2.2--3.5, which need to be addressed and incorporated in the AGN selection function in future in order to improve our results. We make various fitting functions, luminosity function analysis codes, and homogenised AGN data publicly available.},

  abstract      = {We present four radio-loud NLS1 galaxies with extreme emission-line shifts, indicating radial outflow velocities of the ionized gas of up to 2450 km/s, above the escape velocity of the host galaxies. The forbidden lines show strong broadening, up to 2270 km/s. An ionization stratification (higher line shift at higher ionization potential) implies that we see a large-scale outflow rather than single, localized jet-cloud interactions. Similarly, the paucity of zero-velocity [OIII]$\lambda$5007 emitting gas implies the absence of a second narrow-line region (NLR) component at rest, and therefore a large part of the high-ionization NLR is affected by the outflow. Given the radio loudness of these NLS1 galaxies, the observations are consistent with a pole on view onto their central engines, so that the effects of polar outflows are maximized. In addition, a very efficient driving mechanism is required, to reach the high observed velocities. We explore implications from recent hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction between fast winds or jets with the large-scale NLR. Overall, the best agreement with observations (and especially the high outflow speeds of the [NeV] emitting gas) can be reached if the NLS1 galaxies are relatively young sources with lifetimes not much exceeding 1 Myr. These systems represent sites of strong feedback at NLR scales at work, well below redshift one.},

  abstract    = {We report the results of an optical spectroscopic follow-up of four double quasar candidates in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) database. SDSS J1617+3827 is most likely a lensed quasar at z = 2.079, consisting of two images with r ~ 19-21 and separated by ~ 2 arcsec. We identify an extended source northeast of the brightest image as an early-type lensing galaxy at z = 0.602, and detect a candidate for the main deflector in the vicinity of the faintest image. SDSS J2153+2732 consists of two distinct but physically associated quasars at z ~ 2.24 (r ~ 19-20, separation of 3.6 arcsec). Although this system might be a binary quasar, there is evidence of a collision or merger within a galaxy cluster at an early stage. The other two candidates are projected pairs of active galactic nuclei: SDSS J1642+3200 (separation of ~ 3 arcsec) comprises a distant quasar (r ~ 18) at z = 2.263 and the active nucleus (r > 20) of a galaxy at z ~ 0.3, while SDSS J0240-0208 (r ~ 18-19, separation of ~ 1 arcsec) is a pair of quasars at z = 1.687 and z = 1.059. In each of these two systems, the background quasar only suffers a weak gravitational lensing effect by the host galaxy of the foreground active nucleus, so the host galaxy mass is constrained to be less than (2.9-3) x 10^{11} solar masses inside 10 kpc.},

  abstract    = {Context:Quasars radiating at extreme Eddington ratios (xA) are likely a prime mover of galactic evolution and have been hailed as potential distance indicators. Their properties are still scarcely known. Aims:We test the effectiveness of the selection criteria defined on the 4D Eigenvector 1 (4DE1) for identifying xA sources. We provide a quantitative description of their UV spectra in the redshift range 2<z<2.9. Methods:19 extreme quasar candidates were identified using 4DE1 selection criteria applied to SDSS spectra: AlIII1860/SiIII]1892>0.5 and CIII]1909/SiIII]1892<1. The emission line spectra was studied using multicomponent fits of deep spectroscopic observations obtained with the OSIRIS-GTC. Results:Spectra confirm that almost all of these quasars are xA sources with very similar properties. We provide spectrophotometric and line profile measurements for the SiIV1397+OIV]1402, CIV1549+HeII1640, and the 1900A blend composed by AlIII1860, SiIII]1892, FeIII and a weak CIII]1909. The spectra can be characterized as very low ionization (logU~-3), a condition that explains the significant FeIII emission. CIV1549 shows low equivalent width (<30 A for the most sources), and high or extreme blueshift amplitudes (-5000<c(1/2)<-1000 kms-1). Weak-lined quasars appear as extreme xA quasars and not as an independent class. The CIV1549 high amplitude blueshifts coexists in all cases save one with symmetric and narrower AlIII and SiIII] profiles. Estimates of the Eddington ratio using the AlIII FWHM as a virial broadening estimator are consistent with the ones of a previous xA sample. Conclusions:It is now feasible to assemble large samples of xA quasars from the latest data releases of the SDSS. We provide evidence that AlIII1860 could be associated with a low-ionization virialized sub-system, supporting previous suggestions that AlIII is a reliable virial broadening estimator.},

  abstract      = {Two years' worth of u-, g-, r-, i-, and z-band optical light curves were obtained for the massive type 1 quasar PG 2308+098 at z=0.433 using the 1.05-m Kiso Schmidt telescope/Kiso Wide Field Camera, and inter-band time lags of the light curves were measured. Wavelength-dependent continuum reverberation lag signals of several tens of days relative to the u-band were detected at g-, r-, i-, and z-bands, where the longer wavelength bands showed larger lags. From the wavelength-dependent lags, and assuming the standard disk temperature radial profile $T \propto R\_{\rm disk}^{-3/4}$ and an X-ray/far-ultraviolet reprocessing picture, a constraint on the radius of the accretion disk responsible for the rest-frame 2500 $\backslash$AA$\backslash$ disk continuum emission was derived as $R\_{\rm disk} = 9.46^{+0.29}\_{-3.12}$ light-days. The derived disk size is slightly (1.2-1.8 times) larger than the theoretical disk size of $R\_{\rm disk} = 5.46$ light-days predicted from the black hole mass ($M\_{\rm BH}$) and Eddington ratio estimates of PG 2308+098. This result is roughly in accordance with previous studies of lower mass active galactic nuclei (AGNs), where measured disk sizes have been found to be larger than the standard disk model predictions by a factor of $\sim 3$; however, the disk size discrepancy is more modest in PG 2308+098. By compiling literature values of the disk size constraints from continuum reverberation and gravitational microlensing observations for AGNs/quasars, we show that the $M\_{\rm BH}$ dependence of $R\_{\rm disk}$ is weaker than that expected from the standard disk model. These observations suggest that the standard Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disk theory has limitations in describing AGN/quasar accretion disks.},

We combine radio observations at 610 and 235 MHz from the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) with 3.4 Msec X-ray data from the Chandra Observatory. Extracting radial temperature profiles, as well as X-ray and radio surface brightness profiles in three directions showing major morphological disturbances, we highlight the signatures of activity in the system. For the first time we observe radio emission corresponding to the NW X-ray depression, which provides evidence in favor of the classification of the depression as a cavity. We identify two other X-ray cavities situated NW and SW of the AGN. While the central radio emission corresponding to the inner cavities shows flatter spectral index, the radio extensions associated with the furthest X-ray cavities consist of aged plasma. All observed signatures both in radio and X-ray are consistent with several consecutive episodes of AGN activity, which gave rise to the observed morphology NW and SW from the core. In the southern region, we confirm the cooling wake hypothesis for the origin of the long tail. The deep X-ray data also allows us to distinguish significant distortions in the tail's inner parts, which we attribute to the activity of the AGN.},

The NuSTAR spectra show a strong hard (>15 keV) X-ray excess, while simultaneous soft X-ray coverage of one of the observations provided by XMM-Newton constrains the ionised absorption in the source. The pure reflection model requires a black hole of high spin ($a>0.92$) viewed at a moderate inclination ($i=46^{+1}_{-4}$ degrees). The pure partial covering model requires extreme parameters: the cut-off of the primary continuum is very low ($22^{+7}_{-5}$ keV) in one observation and the intrinsic X-ray emission must provide a large fraction (75%) of the bolometric luminosity. Allowing a hybrid model with both partial covering and reflection provides more reasonable absorption parameters and relaxes the constraints on reflection parameters. The fractional variability reduces around the iron K band and at high energies including the Compton hump, suggesting that the reflected emission is less variable than the continuum.},

  abstract      = {The fully analytical solution for isothermal Bondi accretion on a black hole (MBH) at the center of two-component Jaffe (1983) galaxy models is presented. In a previous work we provided the analytical expressions for the critical accretion parameter and the radial profile of the Mach number in the case of accretion on a MBH at the center of a spherically symmetric one-component Jaffe galaxy model. Here we apply this solution to galaxy models where both the stellar and total mass density distributions are described by the Jaffe profile, with different scale-lengths and masses, and to which a central MBH is added. For such galaxy models all the relevant stellar dynamical properties can also be derived analytically (Ciotti {\amp} Ziaee Lorzad 2018). In these new models the hydrodynamical and stellar dynamical properties are linked by imposing that the gas temperature is proportional to the virial temperature of the galaxy stellar component. The formulae that are provided allow to evaluate all flow properties, and are then useful for estimates of the scale-radius and the mass flow rate when modeling accretion on massive black holes at the center of galaxies. As an application, we quantify the departure from the true mass accretion rate of estimates obtained using the gas properties at various distances from the MBH, under the hypothesis of classical Bondi accretion.},

For Mrk 142, its H$\backslash$beta$\backslash$ and H$\backslash$gamma$\backslash$ lines show signatures of outflow. The H$\backslash$beta$\backslash$ and H$\backslash$gamma$\backslash$ maps of Mrk 1044 demonstrate complex kinematics -- a virialized motion accompanied by an outflow signature, and the H$\backslash$beta$\backslash$ map of IRAS F12397+3333 is consistent with a disk or a spherical shell. The H$\backslash$beta$\backslash$ maps of Mrk 486 and MCG +06-26-012 suggest the presence of an inflow and outflow, respectively. These super-Eddington accretors show diverse geometry and kinematics.

  abstract      = {We present our statistical analysis of the connection between active galactic nuclei (AGN) variability and physical properties of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). We constructed optical light curves using data from the QUEST-La Silla AGN variability survey. To model the variability, we used the structure function, among the excess variance and the amplitude from Damp Random Walk (DRW) modelling. For the measurement of SMBH physical properties, we used public spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Our analysis is based on an original sample of 2345 sources detected in both SDSS and QUEST-La Silla. For 1473 of these sources we could perform a proper measurement of the spectral and variability properties, and 1348 of these sources were classified as variable ($91.5\\%$). We found that the amplitude of the variability ($A$) depends solely on the rest frame emission wavelength and the Eddington ratio, where $A$ anti-correlates with both $\lambda\_{rest}$ and $L/L\_{\text{Edd}}$. This suggests that AGN variability does not evolve over cosmic time, and its amplitude is inversely related to the accretion rate. We found that the logarithmic gradient of the variability ($\gamma$) does not correlate significantly with any SMBH physical parameter, since there is no statistically significant linear regression model with an absolute value of the slope higher than 0.1. Finally, we found that the general distribution of $\gamma$ measured for our sample differs from the distribution of $\gamma$ obtained for light curves simulated from a DRW process. For 20.6$\backslash$\% of the variable sources in our sample, a DRW model is not appropriate to describe the variability, since $\gamma$ differers considerably from the expected value of 0.5.},

New Chandra 1.5-9.5 ks exploratory observations were obtained for 32 objects while the others have archival X-ray observations. Significant fractions of these luminous type 1 quasars are distinctly X-ray weak compared to typical quasars, including 16 (48\%) of the WLQs and 17 (94\%) of the PHL 1811 analogs with average X-ray weakness factors of 17 and 39, respectively. We measure a relatively hard ($\Gamma=1.16\_{-0.32}^{+0.37}$) effective power-law photon index for a stack of the X-ray weak subsample, suggesting X-ray absorption, and spectral analysis of one PHL 1811 analog, J1521+5202, also indicates significant intrinsic X-ray absorption. We compare composite SDSS spectra for the X-ray weak and X-ray normal populations and find several optical-UV tracers of X-ray weakness; e.g., Fe II rest-frame equivalent width and relative color. We describe how orientation effects under our previously proposed ``shielding-gas'' scenario can likely unify the X-ray weak and X-ray normal populations. We suggest that the shielding gas may naturally be understood as a geometrically thick inner accretion disk that shields the broad line region from the ionizing continuum. If WLQs and PHL 1811 analogs have very high Eddington ratios, the inner disk could be significantly puffed up (e.g., a slim disk). Shielding of the broad emission-line region by a geometrically thick disk may have a significant role in setting the broad distributions of C IV rest-frame equivalent width and blueshift for quasars more generally.},

  abstract      = {We present XMM-Newton imaging spectroscopy of ten weak emission-line quasars (WLQs) at $0.928\leq z \leq 3.767$, six of which are radio quiet and four which are radio intermediate. The new X-ray data enabled us to measure the power-law photon index, at rest-frame energies $\gt2$ keV, in each source with relatively high accuracy. These measurements allowed us to confirm previous reports that WLQs have steeper X-ray spectra, suggesting higher accretion rates with respect to 'typical' quasars. A comparison between the photon indices of our radio-quiet WLQs and those of a control sample of 85 sources shows that the first are significantly higher, at the $\gt$\~{}$3\sigma$ level. Collectively, the four radio-intermediate WLQs have lower photon indices with respect to the six radio-quiet WLQs, as may be expected if the spectra of the first group are contaminated by X-ray emission from a jet. Therefore, in the absence of significant jet emission along our line of sight, these results are in agreement with the idea that WLQs constitute the extreme high end of the accretion rate distribution in quasars. We detect soft excess emission in our lowest-redshift radio-quiet WLQ, in agreement with previous findings suggesting that the prominence of this feature is associated with a high accretion rate. We have not detected signatures of Compton reflection, Fe K$\alpha$ lines, or strong variability between two X-ray epochs in any of our WLQs, which can be attributed to their relatively high luminosity.},

  abstract      = {We have utilized high-resolution optical Hubble Space Telescope images and deep, ground-based near-infrared images to examine the host-galaxies of 37 active galactic nuclei with reverberation-based black hole masses. Using two-dimensional image decompositions, we have separated the host galaxy from the bright central AGN, allowing a re-examination of the MBH-Lbulge and MBH-Lgalaxy relationships and the MBH-Mbulge and MBH-Mstars relationships using V-H color to constrain the stellar mass-to-light ratio. We find clear correlations for all of these scaling relationships, and the best-fit correlations are generally in good agreement with the sample of early-type galaxies with MBH from dynamical modeling and the sample of megamasers. We also find good agreement with the expectations from the Illustris simulations, although the agreement with other simulations is less clear because of the different black hole mass ranges that are probed. MBH-Lbulge is found to have the least scatter, and is therefore the best predictor of MBH among the relationships examined here. Large photometric surveys that rely on automated analysis and forego bulge-to-disk decompositions will achieve more accurate MBH predictions if they rely on MBH-Mstars rather than MBH-Lgalaxy. Finally, we have examined MBH/Mstars and find a clear trend with black hole mass but not galaxy mass. This same trend is also exhibited by galaxies with MBH from dynamical modeling and megamaser galaxies, as well as simulated galaxies from Illustris, rising from \~{}0.01\% at 10\^{}6 Msun to \~{}1.0\% at 10\^{}10 Msun. This scaling should be taken into account when comparing galaxy samples that are not matched in MBH.},

The doughnut is overpressured compared with the surrounding atmosphere as measured with Chandra. We investigate the polarisation properties of the source and find evidence for an interaction between the doughnut and the external environment. This may cause the extreme jet bend. Alternatively, while providing no explanation for the rotation-measure and magnetic field structure seen in the doughnut, a ballistic precession model may be feasible if the ballistic flow persists for a distance much less than the full extent of the 100 kpc-scale jet. A light jet being deflected by gas flows and winds just outside the transition between the galaxy and cluster atmospheres appears to be a more plausible interpretation.},

This analysis is supplemented by the gas kinematics of Type 2 AGNs from Woo et al. (2016). For the majority of Type 1 AGNs (i.e., \~{} 89\%), the [O III] line profile is best represented by a double Gaussian model, presenting the kinematic signature of the non-virial motion. Blueshifted [O III] is more frequently detected than redshifted [O III] by a factor of 3.6 in Type 1 AGNs, while the ratio between blueshifted to redshifted [O III] is only 1.08 in Type 2 AGNs due to the projection and orientation effect. The fraction of AGNs with outflow signatures is found to increase steeply with [O III] luminosity and Eddington ratio, while Type 1 AGNs have larger velocity dispersion and more negative velocity shift than Type 2 AGNs. The [O III] velocity - velocity dispersion (VVD) diagram of Type 1 AGNs expands towards higher values with increasing luminosity and Eddington ratio, suggesting that the radiation pressure or wind is the main driver of gas outflows, as similarly found in Type 2 AGNs. In contrast, the kinematics of gas outflows is not directly linked to the radio activity of AGN.},

Hopkins. Compared to earlier epochs 3C 120 is about a factor of three brighter, allowing us to study the shape of the broad line region (BLR) and the dust torus in a high luminosity phase. The analysis of the light curves yields that the dust echo is rather sharp and symmetric in contrast to the more complex broad H alpha BLR echo. We investigate how far this supports an optically thick bowl-shaped BLR and dust torus geometry as proposed by Kawaguchi {\amp} Mori (2010) and Goad et al. (2012). The comparison with several parameterizations of these models supports the following geometry: the BLR clouds lie inside the bowl closely above the bowl rim, up to a half covering angle 0 deg $\lt$ theta $\lt$ 40 deg (measured against the equatorial plane). Then the BLR is spread over many isodelay surfaces, yielding a smeared and structured echo as observed. Furthermore, if the BLR clouds shield the bottom of the bowl rim against radiation from the nucleus, the hot dust emission comes essentially from the top edge of the bowl (40 deg $\lt$ theta $\lt$ 45 deg). Then, for small inclinations as for 3C120, the top dust edge forms a ring which largely coincides with a narrow range of isodelay surfaces, yielding the observed sharp dust echo. The scale height of the BLR increases with radial distance from the black hole. This leads to luminosity dependent foreshortening effects of the lag. We discuss implications and possible corrections of the foreshortening for the black hole mass determination and consequences for the lag (size) - luminosity relationships and the difference to interferometric torus sizes.},

  abstract      = {Powerful winds driven by active galactic nuclei are often thought to affect the evolution of both supermassive black holes and their host galaxies, quenching star formation and explaining the close relationship between black holes and galaxies. Recent observations of large-scale molecular outflows in ultraluminous infrared galaxies support this quasar-feedback idea, because they directly trace the gas from which stars form. Theoretical models suggest that these outflows originate as energy-conserving flows driven by fast accretion-disk winds. Proposed connections between large-scale molecular outflows and accretion-disk activity in ultraluminous galaxies were incomplete because no accretion-disk wind had been detected. Conversely, studies of powerful accretion-disk winds have until now focused only on X-ray observations of local Seyfert galaxies and a few higher-redshift quasars. Here we report observations of a powerful accretion-disk wind with a mildly relativistic velocity (a quarter that of light) in the X-ray spectrum of IRAS F11119+3257, a nearby (redshift 0.189) optically classified type 1 ultraluminous infrared galaxy hosting a powerful molecular outflow. The active galactic nucleus is responsible for about 80 per cent of the emission, with a quasar-like luminosity of 1.5 {\times} 10$^{46}$ ergs per second. The energetics of these two types of wide-angle outflows is consistent with the energy-conserving mechanism that is the basis of the quasar feedback in active galactic nuclei that lack powerful radio jets (such jets are an alternative way to drive molecular outflows).},

Here we report the direct detection of a population of distant type-2 quasars, which is at least comparable in size to the well-known unobscured type-1 population. We selected objects that have mid-infrared and radio emissions characteristic of quasars, but which are faint at near-infrared and optical wavelengths. We conclude that this population is responsible for most of the black-hole growth in the young Universe and that, throughout cosmic history, black-hole growth occurs in the dusty, gas-rich centres of active galaxies.},

  abstract      = {We analyse 2,015 mid-infrared (MIR) spectra of galaxies observed with $\mathit{Spitzer}$'s Infrared Spectrograph, including objects with growing super-massive black holes and objects where most of the infrared emission originates from newly formed stars. We determine if and how accreting super-massive black holes at the centre of galaxies -- known as active galactic nuclei (AGN) -- heat and ionize their host galaxies' dust and molecular gas. We use four MIR diagnostics to estimate the contribution of the AGN to the total MIR emission. We refer to galaxies whose AGN contribute more than 50 per cent of the total MIR emission as AGN-dominated. We compare the relative strengths of PAH emission features and find that PAH grains in AGN-dominated sources have a wider range of sizes and fractional ionizations than PAH grains in non-AGN dominated sources. We measure rotational transitions of $\mathrm{H\_{2}}$ and estimate $\mathrm{H\_{2}}$ excitation temperatures and masses for individual targets, $\mathrm{H\_{2}}$ excitation temperatures for spectra stacked by their AGN contribution to the MIR, and the $\mathrm{H\_{2}}$ excitation temperature distributions via a hierarchical Bayesian model. We find an average 200 K difference between the excitation temperatures of the $\mathrm{H\_{2}}$ S(5) and $\mathrm{H\_{2}}$ S(7) pure rotational molecular hydrogen transition pair in AGN-dominated versus non-AGN dominated galaxies. Our findings suggest that AGN impact the interstellar medium of their host galaxies.},

The birth and growth of the first `seed' black holes in the earlier Universe, however, is observationally unconstrained and we are only beginning to piece together a scenario for their subsequent evolution. Here we report that the nearby dwarf starburst galaxy Henize2-10 (refs 5 and 6) contains a compact radio source at the dynamical centre of the galaxy that is spatially coincident with a hard X-ray source. From these observations, we conclude that Henize2-10 harbours an actively accreting central black hole with a mass of approximately one million solar masses. This nearby dwarf galaxy, simultaneously hosting a massive black hole and an extreme burst of star formation, is analogous in many ways to galaxies in the infant Universe during the early stages of black-hole growth and galaxy mass assembly. Our results confirm that nearby star-forming dwarf galaxies can indeed form massive black holes, and that by implication so can their primordial counterparts. Moreover, the lack of a substantial spheroidal component in Henize2-10 indicates that supermassive black-hole growth may precede the build-up of galaxy spheroids.},

  abstract      = {(Abridged) Conventional radio surveys of deep fields ordinarily have arc-second scale resolutions often insufficient to reliably separate radio emission in distant galaxies originating from star-formation and AGN-related activity. Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) can offer a solution by identifying only the most compact radio emitting regions in galaxies at cosmological distances where the high brightness temperatures (in excess of $10^5$ K) can only be reliably attributed to AGN activity. We present the first in a series of papers exploring the faint compact radio population using a new wide-field VLBI survey of the GOODS-N field. The unparalleled sensitivity of the European VLBI Network (EVN) will probe a luminosity range rarely seen in deep wide-field VLBI observations, thus providing insights into the role of AGN to radio luminosities of the order $10^{22}~\mathrm{W\,Hz^{-1}}$ across cosmic time. The newest VLBI techniques are used to completely cover an entire 7'.5 radius area to milliarcsecond resolutions, while bright radio sources ($S \gt 0.1$ mJy) are targeted up to 25 arcmin from the pointing centre. Multi-source self-calibration, and a primary beam model for the EVN array are used to correct for residual phase errors and primary beam attenuation respectively. This paper presents the largest catalogue of VLBI detected sources in GOODS-N comprising of 31 compact radio sources across a redshift range of 0.11-3.44, almost three times more than previous VLBI surveys in this field. We provide a machine-readable catalogue and introduce the radio properties of the detected sources using complementary data from the e-MERLIN Galaxy Evolution survey (eMERGE).},

  abstract      = {When a supermassive black hole at the centre of a galaxy accretes matter, it gives rise to a highly energetic phenomenon: an active galactic nucleus. Numerous physical processes have been proposed to account for the funnelling of gas towards the galactic centre to feed the black hole. There are also several physical processes that can remove gas from a galaxy, one of which is ram-pressure stripping by the hot gas that fills the space between galaxies in galaxy clusters. Here we report that six out of a sample of seven {\lsquo}jellyfish{\rsquo} galaxies{\mdash}galaxies with long {\lsquo}tentacles{\rsquo} of material that extend for dozens of kiloparsecs beyond the galactic disks{\mdash}host an active nucleus, and two of them also have galactic-scale ionization cones. The high incidence of nuclear activity among heavily stripped jellyfish galaxies may be due to ram pressure causing gas to flow towards the centre and triggering the activity, or to an enhancement of the stripping caused by energy injection from the active nucleus, or both. Our analysis of the galactic position and velocity relative to the cluster strongly supports the first hypothesis, and puts forward ram pressure as another possible mechanism for feeding the central supermassive black hole with gas.},

  abstract      = {Recent all-sky surveys have led to the discovery of new types of transients. These include stars disrupted by the central supermassive black hole, and supernovae that are 10-100 times more energetic than typical ones. However, the nature of even more energetic transients that apparently occur in the innermost regions of their host galaxies is hotly debated$^{1-3}$. Here we report the discovery of the most energetic of these to date: PS1-10adi, with a total radiated energy of  2.3 {\times} 10$^{52}$ erg. The slow evolution of its light curve and persistently narrow spectral lines over {\tilde} 3 yr are inconsistent with known types of recurring black hole variability. The observed properties imply powering by shock interaction between expanding material and large quantities of surrounding dense matter. Plausible sources of this expanding material are a star that has been tidally disrupted by the central black hole, or a supernova. Both could satisfy the energy budget. For the former, we would be forced to invoke a new and hitherto unseen variant of a tidally disrupted star, while a supernova origin relies principally on environmental effects resulting from its nuclear location. Remarkably, we also discover that PS1-10adi is not an isolated case. We therefore surmise that this new population of transients has previously been overlooked due to incorrect association with underlying central black hole activity.},

Here we report observations over a period of ten{\thinsp}months of a transient, hitherto interpreted$^{7}$ as a superluminous supernova$^{8}$. Our data show that the transient rebrightened substantially in the ultraviolet and that the spectrum went through three different spectroscopic phases without ever becoming nebular. Our observations are more consistent with a tidal disruption event than a superluminous supernova because of the temperature evolution$^{6}$, the presence of highly ionized CNO gas in the line of sight$^{9}$ and our improved localization of the transient in the nucleus of a passive galaxy, where the presence of massive stars is highly unlikely$^{10,11}$. While the supermassive black hole has a mass $\gt$10$^{8}$ M $_{⊙}$ $^{12,13}$, a star with the same mass as the Sun could be disrupted outside the event horizon if the black hole were spinning rapidly$^{14}$. The rapid spin and high black hole mass can explain the high luminosity of this event.},

  abstract      = {Disk reverberation mapping of a handful of nearby AGN suggest accretion disk sizes which are a factor few too large for their luminosities, apparently at odds with the standard model. Here, we investigate the likely contribution to the measured delay signature of diffuse continuum emission arising from broad line region gas. We start by constructing spherically symmetric pressure-law BLR models (i.e., $P(r)\propto r^{-s}$) that approximately reproduce the observed emission line fluxes of the strong UV--optical emission-lines in the best-studied source, NGC\~{}5548. We then determine the contribution of the diffuse continuum to the measured continuum flux and inter-band delays, accounting for the observed variability behaviour of the ionizing nuclear continuum. Those pressure-law models that approximately reproduce the observed emission-line luminosities unavoidably produce substantial diffuse continuum emission. This causes a significant contamination of the disk reverberation signature (i.e., wavelength-dependent continuum delays). Qualitatively, the diffuse continuum delay signatures produced by our models resemble that observed for NGC\~{}5548, including the deviation of the lag spectrum above that of a simple power-law in wavelength, short-ward of the Balmer and Paschen jumps. Furthermore, for reasonable estimates of the BLR covering fraction, the delay induced by diffuse continuum emission causes elevated inter-band delays over the entire UV--optical regime; for these pressure-law models, there are no `disk-dominated' wavelength intervals. Thus, the diffuse continuum contribution must be taken into account in order to correctly infer AGN accretion disk sizes based on inter-band continuum delays.},

Our goal is to understand whether the physical conditions in the interstellar medium of these objects differ from those of local AGN selected by their optical emission line ratios. To enable this comparison, we construct a control sample of 50,000 optically-selected AGN with the same redshifts that do not have strong mid-IR excess emission. The mid-IR excess and control samples differ strongly in [OIII] line luminosity, ionized gas excitation mechanism, ionization state and electron density. We show that the radio-detected, mid-IR excess AGN constitute the most luminous and highly ionized AGN in the local Universe and they contribute primarily to the growth of black holes in the most massive galaxies. At least half of this black hole growth is occurring in galaxies with recent starbursts. The morphologies of these systems indicate that the starbursts have probably been triggered by galaxy-galaxy mergers and interactions. The most luminous AGN in our mid-IR excess sample have properties that are similar to the Type II quasars studied at higher redshifts. In contrast, the control sample constitute a class of lower ionization, less luminous AGN in more quiescent galaxies that contribute primarily to the growth of low mass black holes.},

Such an approach has often been used in the literature, since it is difficult to measure $\sigma\_{\star}$ for type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) due to the AGN continuum outshining the stellar-absorption lines. Fitting the [OIII] line with a single Gaussian or Gauss-Hermite polynomials overestimates $\sigma\_{\star}$ by 50-100\%. When line asymmetries from non-gravitational gas motion are excluded in a double Gaussian fit, the average ratio between the core [OIII] width ($\sigma\_{\rm {[OIII],D}}$) and $\sigma\_{\star}$ is $\sim$1, but with individual data points off by up to a factor of two. The resulting black-hole-mass-$\sigma\_{\rm {[OIII],D}}$ relation scatters around that of quiescent galaxies and reverberation-mapped AGNs. However, a direct comparison between $\sigma\_{\star}$ and $\sigma\_{\rm {[OIII],D}}$ shows no close correlation, only that both quantities have the same range, average and standard deviation, probably because they feel the same gravitational potential. The large scatter is likely due to the fact that line profiles are a luminosity-weighted average, dependent on the light distribution and underlying kinematic field. Within the range probed by our sample (80-260 km s$^{-1}$), our results strongly caution against the use of [OIII] width as a surrogate for $\sigma\_{\star}$ on an individual basis. Even though our sample consists of radio-quiet AGNs, FIRST radio-detected objects have, on average, a $\sim$10\% larger [OIII] core width.},

At least 3/4 of the significant offsets are confirmed to occur downstream or upstream the jet representing a genuine astrophysical effect. By introducing redshift and Gaia color into analysis, we are able to distinguish between the effect of the host galaxy, jet, and accretion disk. Strong optical jets being at least 20-50-pc long are required to explain the offsets downstream. Offsets upstream of up to 2 mas are at least partly due to the dominant impact of the accretion disk on the Gaia coordinates and by the effects of parsec-scale radio jet. The host galaxy was found not to play an important role in the detected offsets. BL Lacertae object, radio galaxies, and Seyfert 2 galaxies are observationally confirmed to have a relatively weak disk and consequently downstream offsets. The disk dominates in the Gaia band and drives upstream offsets in a significant fraction of quasars and Seyfert 1 galaxies depending on the relative brightness of the disk and jet. The observed behaviour of the different AGN classes is consistent with the unified scheme assuming varying contribution of the obscuring dusty torus and jet beaming.},

The XMM-Newton spectrum from the year 2000 is characterized by an unobscured power-law spectrum with photon index of $\Gamma\sim 2$, a column density of $N\_{\mathrm{H}}\sim 5\times 10^{20}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$, and no prominent reflection component. Five years later, Chandra captured the source in a heavily-obscured, reflection-dominated state. The observed X-ray spectral variability could be caused by a Compton-thick cloud with $N\_{\mathrm{H}}\sim 2\times 10^{24}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ eclipsing the direct emission of the hot corona, implying an extreme $N\_{\mathrm{H}}$ variation never before observed in a type-1 QSO. An alternative scenario is a corona that switched off in between the observations. In addition, both explanations require a significant change of the X-ray luminosity prior to the obscuration or fading of the corona and/or a change of the relative geometry of the source/reflector system. Dramatic X-ray spectral variability of this kind could be quite common in type-1 QSOs, considering the relatively few datasets in which such an event could have been identified. Our analysis implies that there may be a population of type-1 QSOs which are Compton-thick in the X-rays when observed at any given time.},

  abstract  = {Galaxies are known to contain black holes (e.g. Ferrarese {\amp} Merritt 2000), whose mass correlates with the mass of their bulge. A fraction of them also has an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), showing excess emission thought to be due to accretion of mass by the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy. It is thought that AGNs play a very important role during the formation of galaxies by creating large outflows that stop star formation in the galaxy (see e.g. Kormendy {\amp} Ho 2013). The aim is to detect the fraction of Low Luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus (LLAGN) in the nearby Universe. At present, they are typically found using optical spectroscopy (e.g. Kauffmann, Heckman et al. 2003), who discuss the influence of the AGN on the host galaxy and vice versa. However, optical spectra are seriously affected by extinction in these generally very dusty objects, and therefore can only give us partial information about the AGN. I used a newly-found method, and apply it to the S4G sample, a large, complete, sample of nearby galaxies, which I am studying in detail with a large collaboration, to detect the fraction of low luminosity AGNs, and to better understand the relation between AGNs and their host galaxy which is thought to be crucial for their formation.},

  abstract      = {We analyze 168 Swift monitoring observations of the nearest broad absorption line quasar Mrk 231 in the UV and X-ray bands, where we detect significant variability in the UV ($\sim$2246$\backslash$AA) light curve with a null probability of $4.3\times10^{-10}$ for a constant model. Separately, from an archival sample of Swift observed active galactic nuclei (AGN), we measure the relation between UV excess variance and luminosity, finding that the normalized UV excess variance decreases with luminosity. Comparing to this mean relation, the normalized UV excess variance of Mrk 231 is smaller, however within the scatter characterising the full population. The upper limit of the X-ray excess variance is consistent with other AGN. The power spectrum density of the UV light curve can be well fit by a power law model with a slope of $1.82\pm0.14$ between $10^{-7.5}$ and $10^{-6}$ Hz, consistent with those for typical AGN, with no obvious quasi-periodical oscillation peaks. The UV variability and its power spectrum suggest that a significant amount of the UV emission of Mrk 231 is from the accretion disk. The consistencies in the normalized UV variability and the shape of the power spectrum density between Mrk 231 and other normal AGN suggest that the origin of UV variability of broad absorption line quasars is similar to other AGN, and dust scattering at large scales such as the torus is not a dominating process for the UV emission of Mrk 231. Significant scattering, if present, is constrained to smaller than $\sim$10 light days. We perform lagged correlation analysis between the UV and X-ray light curves and find the correlation insignificant within the present data.},

  year          = {2018},
  month         = aug,
  abstract      = {The [OII] 3726+3728$\backslash$AA$\backslash$ emission line doublet is often used to estimate star formation rates within the host galaxies of active galactic nuclei (AGN), as it is known to be strongly excited by star formation, but is only weakly excited in the broad and narrow line regions of AGN. However, within AGN host galaxies, [OII] can also be excited in low-density gas located at appreciable distances from the nucleus, but still ionized by the AGN. These AGN extended emission line regions (EELRs) can contribute significant flux to integrated spectra, even in the presence of luminous AGN. Here, we identify EELRs by the presence of the [NeV] 3426$\backslash$AA$\backslash$ emission line, which, like [OII], is not strongly excited in the inner regions of AGN, but is a prominent emission line in the lower density EELRs. Critically, unlike [OII], [NeV] is not excited by star formation. Therefore, when strong [NeV] is present in an AGN spectrum, the flux from the EELR is not negligible, implying the [OII] flux is contaminated by emission from the EELR, and is not a good measure of star formation. After removing objects with EELRs identified by [NeV], the [OII] flux in the host galaxies of radio-loud AGN is found to be higher than that within radio-quiet AGN, which could either indicate higher star-formation rates, or the presence of moderate-velocity shocks. Being mindful of EELRs for upcoming large-area spectroscopic surveys, particularly those tied to radio continuum surveys, will be important for determining star formation rates in AGN host galaxies.},

  abstract      = {Aims. With the aim of performing a suitable comparison of the internal process of galactic bars with respect to the external effect of interactions on driving gas toward the inner most region of the galaxies, we explored the efficiency of both mechanisms on central nuclear activity in active galactic nuclei (AGN) in spiral galaxies. Methods. We selected samples of barred AGN and active objects residing in pair systems, derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). In order to carry out a reliable comparison of both samples (AGNs in barred hosts in isolation and in galaxy pairs), we selected spiral AGN galaxies with similar distributions of redshift, magnitude, stellar mass, color and stellar age population from both catalogs. With the goal of providing an appropriate quantification of the influence of bars and interactions on nuclear activity, we also constructed a suitable control sample of unbarred spiral AGNs with similar host properties than the other two samples. Results. We found that barred AGNs show an excess of nuclear activity (as derived from the $Lum[OIII]$) and accretion rate ($\cal R$) with respect to AGN in pairs. In addition, both samples show an excess of high values of $Lum[OIII]$ and $\cal R$ with respect to unbarred AGNs in the control sample. We also found that the fractions of AGNs with powerful nuclear activity and high accretion rates increase toward more massive hosts with bluer colors and younger stellar populations. Moreover, AGNs with bars exhibit a higher fraction of galaxies with powerful $Lum[OIII]$ and efficient $\cal R$ with respect to AGNs inhabiting pair systems. Regarding to AGN belonging to pair systems, we found that the central nuclear activity is remarkably dependent on the galaxy pair companion features.},

This quasar shows two broad absorption components (blue component at $v \sim 14,000\ km\ s^{-1}$, and red component at $v \sim 4,000\ km\ s^{-1}$ with respect to the quasars systemic redshift). The absorption profiles of CIV and SiIV BAL of the blue component show decrease in outflow velocity with an average deceleration rate of $-1.62\_{-0.05}^{+0.04}\ cm\ s^{-2}$ and $-1.14^{+0.21}\_{-0.22}\ cm\ s^{-2}$ over a rest-frame time-span of 4.15 yr. We do not see any acceleration signature in the red component. This is consistent with dramatic variabilities usually seen at high velocities. During our monitoring period the quasar has shown no strong continuum variability. We suggest the observed variability could be related to the time dependent changes in disk wind parameters like launching radius, initial flow velocity or mass outflow rate.},

In combination with deep Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 rest-frame optical imaging, Keck/MOSFIRE rest-optical spectroscopy, and Keck/KCWI rest-UV integral field spectroscopy we demonstrate that both the continuum and emission-line structure of these sources exhibit a wide range of morphologies from compact isolated point sources to double-AGN merging systems with extensive \~{} 50 kpc tidal tails. One of the twelve galaxies previously known to exhibit a proximate damped LyA system coincident in redshift with the galaxy shows evidence for both an extended [O III] narrow-line emission region and spatially offset LyA emission (with morphologically distinct blueshifted and redshifted components) indicative of large scale gas flows photoionized by the central AGN. We do not find widespread evidence of star formation in the host galaxies surrounding these AGN; the [O III] velocity dispersions tend to be high (sigma = 100 - 500 km/s), the continuum morphologies are much more compact than a mass-matched star forming comparison sample, and the diagnostic nebular emission line ratios are dominated by an AGN-like ionizing spectrum. The sample is most consistent with a population of AGN that radiate at approximately their Eddington limit and photoionize extended [O III] nebulae whose characteristic sizes scale approximately as the square root of the AGN luminosity.},

We detected diffuse nuclear emission and a filamentary ionized gas structure forming a one-sided, triangular-shaped region extending out to $\sim$80 kpc. The central emission line region is dominated by two compact knots of similar flux: the first (N1) cospatial with the radio core and the (N2) second located 1.2`` (5.3 kpc) to the SE. The two regions differ dramatically from the point of view of velocity (with an offset of \~{}400 km/s), line widths, and line ratios. This suggests that we are observing a dual AGN system formed by a radio loud AGN and type 2 QSO companion, which is the result of the recent merger that also produced its disturbed host morphology. The alternative possibility that N2 is just a bright emission line knot resulting from, for example, a jet-cloud interaction, is disfavored because of 1) the presence of a high ionization bicone whose apex is located at N2; 2) the observed narrow line widths; 3) its line luminosity (\~{}10\^{}42 erg s-1) typical of luminous QSOs; and 4) its location, which is offset from the jet path. The putative secondary AGN must be highly obscured, since we do not detect any emission in the Chandra and infrared Hubble Space Telescope images.},

We study the proximity effect both in the longitudinal as well as in the transverse directions, by carrying out a statistical comparison of the Ly$\alpha$ absorption lines originating from the vicinity of quasars to those originating from the general inter-galactic medium (IGM). This was done using a control sample of IGM, matched in absorption redshift and signal-to-noise ratio to that of our sample probing the proximity region. In our analysis, we found that the ratio of the observed median optical depths of the proximity region ($\langle\tau\_{prox}\rangle$) and the IGM ($\langle \tau\_{IGM}\rangle$) around the quasar within $r\lt3$ Mpc differs in the longitudinal and the transverse directions, having values $\sim$0.84 and $\sim$1.14 which deviates from unity at 2.13$\sigma$ and 2.30$\sigma$ level respectively. However, after taking into account the corrections due to excess ionization from the quasars, validated for spectra at SDSS resolution using detailed simulations, we found that the corrected $\langle\tau\_{prox}\rangle/\langle\tau\_{IGM}\rangle$ steeply increase towards the quasar both in the longitudinal and the transverse directions. The average value of the corrected $\langle\tau\_{prox}\rangle/\langle\tau\_{IGM}\rangle$ are 1.53 and 1.76 (within $r\lt3$ Mpc) deviating from unity at 3.84$\sigma$ and 9.26$\sigma$ significance respectively. The difference of the corrected $\langle\tau\_{prox}\rangle/\langle\tau\_{IGM}\rangle$ values (within $r\lt3$ Mpc) among these two directions is found to be significant at 2.11$\sigma$ level, being higher in the transverse direction.

  abstract      = {Quasars whose broad emission lines show temporal, bulk radial velocity (RV) shifts have been proposed as candidate sub-parsec (sub-pc), binary supermassive black holes (BSBHs). We identified a sample of 16 BSBH candidates based on two-epoch spectroscopy among 52 quasars with significant RV shifts over a few rest-frame years. The candidates showed consistent velocity shifts independently measured from two broad lines (H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ or Mg${\rm \,II}$) without significant changes in the broad-line profiles. Here in the third paper of the series, we present further third- and fourth-epoch spectroscopy for 12 of the 16 candidates for continued RV tests, spanning $\sim$5--15 yr in the quasars' rest frames. Cross-correlation analysis of the broad H$\beta$ calibrated against [O${\rm\,III}]\,\lambda 5007$ suggests that 5 of the 12 quasars remain valid as BSBH candidates. They show broad H$\beta$ RV curves that are consistent with binary orbital motion without significant changes in the broad line profiles. Its broad H$\alpha$ (or Mg${\rm \,II}$) displays RV shifts either consistent with or smaller than those seen in broad H$\beta$. The RV shifts can be explained by a $\sim$0.05--0.1 pc BSBH with an orbital period of $\sim$40--130 yr, assuming a mass ratio of 0.5--2 and a circular orbit. However, the parameters are not well constrained given the few epochs that sample only a small portion of the hypothesized binary orbital cycle. The apparent occurrence rate of sub-pc BSBHs is $\lesssim$13$\pm$5\% among all SDSS quasars, with no significant difference in the subsets with and without single-epoch broad line velocity offsets. Dedicated long-term spectroscopic monitoring is still needed to further confirm or reject these BSBH candidates.},

We discover 15 millimeter sources in the fields excluding the quasars themselves, corresponding to an overdensity $\delta\_{\rm gal} \equiv (N\_{\rm gal} - N\_{\rm exp})/N\_{\rm exp} = -0.07\pm0.56$, consistent with no detected overdensity of dusty galaxies within 140 physical kpc of the quasars. However, the apparent lack of continuum overdensity does not negate the hypothesis that quasars live in overdense environments, as evidenced by strong [CII] overdensities found on the same scales to similarly-selected quasars. The small field of view of ALMA could miss a true overdensity if it exists on scales larger than 1$\backslash$,cMpc, if the quasar is not centered in the overdensity, or if quasar feedback plays a role close to the quasar, but it is most likely that the large line of sight volume probed by a continuum survey will wash out a true overdensity signal. We discuss the necessary factors in determining the bias with which dusty star-forming galaxies trace true dark matter overdensities in order to improve upon overdensity searches in dust continuum.},

Because of the strong diffuse thermal emission from the cluster in X-rays, the detailed properties and the origin of a power-law component from the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) remains unclear in the source. We report here the first NuSTAR observations of 3C 84. The source was observed for 24.2 and 32 ks on February 01 and 04, 2018, respectively. NuSTAR observations spectrally decompose the power-law AGN component above 10 keV. The power-law component dominates the spectrum above 20 keV with a photon index $\sim$1.9 and an energy flux F$\_{20-30 keV}$ = 1.0 $\times$10$^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, corresponding to an isotropic luminosity, $L\_{20-30 keV}$ = 7.4$\times$10$^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We discuss possible emitting sites for the power-law component. The expected thermal emission from the accretion disk is not hot enough to account for the hard X-rays detected from the source. Similar X-ray and $\gamma$-ray photon indices and long-term flux variations, the absence of cutoff energy in the hard X-ray spectrum of the source, correlated hard X-ray flux and hardness ratio variations, and the similarity of optical-X-ray slope to blazar rather than Seyfert galaxies supports the hard X-ray power-law component originating from the jet.},

  abstract      = {Exploring how radio-emitting active galactic nuclei (AGN) behave and evolve with time is critical for understanding how AGN feedback impacts galaxy evolution. In this work, we investigate the relationship between 1.4 GHz radio continuum AGN luminosity ($L^{\rm AGN}\_{\rm 1.4}$), specific black hole accretion rate (s-BHAR, defined as the accretion luminosity relative to the galaxy stellar mass) and redshift, for a luminosity-complete sample of radio-selected AGN in the VLA COSMOS 3 GHz Large Project. The sample was originally selected from radio-continuum observations at 3 GHz, and includes about 1800 radio AGN identified via ($\gt2\sigma$) radio-excess relative to the infrared-radio correlation of star-forming galaxies. We further select a subsample of over 1200 radio AGN that is complete in $L^{\rm AGN}\_{\rm 1.4}$ over different redshift ranges, out to z\~{}4, and use X-ray stacking to calculate the average s-BHAR in each $L^{\rm AGN}\_{\rm 1.4}$-$z$ bin. We find that the average s-BHAR is independent of $L^{\rm AGN}\_{\rm 1.4}$, at all redshifts. However, we see a strong increase of s-BHAR with redshift, at fixed $L^{\rm AGN}\_{\rm 1.4}$. This trend resembles the strong increase in the fraction of star-forming host galaxies (based on the $(NUV-r)$ / $(r-J)$ colours) with redshift, at fixed $L^{\rm AGN}\_{\rm 1.4}$. A possible explanation for this similarity might imply a link between average AGN radiative power and availability of cold gas supply within the host galaxy. This study corroborates the idea that radio-selected AGN become more radiatively efficient towards earlier epochs, independently of their radio power.},

  abstract      = {We report initial results from a large Gemini program to observe z$\gt$\~{}5.7 quasars with GNIRS near-IR spectroscopy. Our sample includes 50 quasars with simultaneous \~{}0.85-2.5 micron spectra covering the rest-frame ultraviolet and major broad emission lines from Ly-alpha to MgII. We present spectral measurements for these quasars and compare to their lower-redshift counterparts at z=1.5-2.3. We find that when quasar luminosity is matched, there are no significant differences between the rest-UV spectra of z$\gt$\~{}5.7 quasars and the low-z comparison sample. High-z quasars have similar continuum and emission line properties and occupy the same region in the black hole mass and luminosity space as the comparison sample, accreting at an average Eddington ratio of \~{}0.3. There is no evidence for super-Eddington accretion or hypermassive ($\gt$10\^{}10 Msun) black holes within our sample. We find a mild excess of quasars with weak CIV lines relative to the control sample. Our results, corroborating earlier studies but with better statistics, demonstrate that these high-z quasars are already mature systems of accreting supermassive black holes operating with the same physical mechanisms as those at lower redshifts.},

  abstract      = {Galactic outflows are now commonly observed in starburst and active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies. Yet, there is no clear consensus on their physical driving mechanism(s). We have previously shown that AGN radiative feedback, driven by radiation pressure on dust, can account for the observed dynamics and energetics of galactic outflows, provided that radiation trapping is taken into account. Here we generalise our model results by explicitly considering the temporal evolution of the central AGN luminosity, and the shell mass evolution in different ambient density distributions. In the case of fixed-mass shells, the high observed values of the momentum ratio ($\zeta = \dot{p}/(L/c)$) and energy ratio ($\epsilon\_k = \dot{E}\_{k}/L$) may be attributed to either radiation trapping or AGN luminosity decay. In contrast, for expanding shells sweeping up mass from the surrounding environment, a decay in AGN luminosity cannot account for the observed high energetics, and radiation trapping is necessarily required. Indeed, strong radiation trapping, e.g. due to high dust-to-gas ratios, can considerably boost the outflow energetics. We obtain a distinct radial dependence for the outflow energetics ($\zeta(r)$, $\epsilon\_k(r)$) in the case of radiation trapping and luminosity decay, which may help discriminate between the two scenarios. In this framework, the recently discovered `fossil' outflows, with anomalously high values of the energetics, may be interpreted as relics of past AGN activity. The observed outflow properties may therefore provide useful constraints on the past history of AGN activity and/or the physical conditions of the outflow launch region.},
