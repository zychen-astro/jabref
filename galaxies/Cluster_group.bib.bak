  title       = {New Interpretation of the mass-temperature relation and mass calibration of galaxy clusters based on the fundamental plane},
  abstract    = {Observations and numerical simulations have shown that the relation between the mass scaled with the critical density of the Universe and the X-ray temperature of galaxy clusters is approximately represented by $M_\Delta \propto T_X^{3/2}$ (e.g. $\Delta=500$). This relation is often interpreted as evidence that clusters are in virial equilibrium. However, the recently discovered fundamental plane (FP) of clusters indicates that the temperature of clusters primarily depends on a combination of the characteristic mass $M_s$ and radius $r_s$ of the Navarro-Frenk-White profile rather than $M_\Delta$. Moreover, the angle of the FP revealed that clusters are not in virial equilibrium because of continuous mass accretion from the surrounding matter. By considering both the FP and the mass-dependence of the cluster concentration parameter, we show that this paradox can be solved and the relation $M_\Delta \propto T_X^{3/2}$ actually reflects the central structure of clusters. We also find that the intrinsic scatter in the halo concentration-mass relation can largely account for the spread of clusters on the FP. We also show that X-ray data alone form the FP and the angle and the position are consistent with those of the FP constructed from gravitational-lensing data. We demonstrate that a possible shift between the two FPs can be used to calibrate cluster masses obtained via X-ray observations.},

  abstract      = {We present a sample of 329 low to intermediate redshift ($0.05 \lt z \lt 0.3$) brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in X-ray selected clusters from the SPectroscopic IDentification of eRosita Sources (SPIDERS) survey, a spectroscopic survey within Sloan Digital Sky Survey-IV (SDSS-IV). We define our BCGs by simultaneous consideration of legacy X-ray data from ROSAT, maximum likelihood outputs from an optical cluster-finder algorithm and visual inspection. Using SDSS imaging data, we fit S$\backslash$'ersic profiles to our BCGs in three bands ($\backslash$textit$\{$g$\}$, $\backslash$textit$\{$r$\}$, $\backslash$textit$\{$i$\}$) with $\backslash$textsc$\{$SIGMA$\}$, a $\backslash$textsc$\{$GALFIT$\}$-based software wrapper. We examine the reliability of our fits by running our pipeline on ${\sim}10^{4}$ psf-convolved model profiles injected into 8 random cluster fields, we then use the results of this analysis to create a robust subsample of 198 BCGs. We outline three cluster properties of interest: overall cluster X-ray luminosity ($L\_{X}$), cluster richness as estimated by $\backslash$textsc$\{$redMaPPer$\}$ ($ \lambda $) and cluster halo mass ($M\_{200}$), which is estimated via velocity dispersion. In general, there are significant correlations with BCG stellar mass between all three environmental properties, but no significant trends arise with either S$\backslash$'ersic index or effective radius. There is no major environmental dependence on the strength of the relation between effective radius and BCG stellar mass. Stellar mass therefore arises as the most important factor governing BCG morphology. Our results indicate that our sample consists of a large number of relaxed, mature clusters containing broadly homogeneous BCGs up to $z \sim 0.3$, suggesting that there is little evidence for much ongoing structural evolution for BCGs in these systems.},

  abstract     = {We present a comparison of two samples of z>0.8 galaxy clusters selected using different wavelength-dependent techniques and examine the physical differences between them. We consider 18 clusters from the X-ray selected XMM-LSS distant cluster survey and 92 clusters from the optical-MIR selected SpARCS cluster survey. Both samples are selected from the same approximately 9 square degree sky area and we examine them using common XMM-Newton, Spitzer-SWIRE and CFHT Legacy Survey data. Clusters from each sample are compared employing aperture measures of X-ray and MIR emission. We divide the SpARCS distant cluster sample into three sub-samples: a) X-ray bright, b) X-ray faint, MIR bright, and c) X-ray faint, MIR faint clusters. We determine that X-ray and MIR selected clusters display very similar surface brightness distributions of galaxy MIR light. In addition, the average location and amplitude of the galaxy red sequence as measured from stacked colour histograms is very similar in the X-ray and MIR-selected samples. The sub-sample of X-ray faint, MIR bright clusters displays a distribution of BCG-barycentre position offsets which extends to higher values than all other samples. This observation indicates that such clusters may exist in a more disturbed state compared to the majority of the distant cluster population sampled by XMM-LSS and SpARCS. This conclusion is supported by stacked X-ray images for the X-ray faint, MIR bright cluster sub-sample that display weak, centrally-concentrated X-ray emission, consistent with a population of growing clusters accreting from an extended envelope of material.},

  abstract      = {Massive clusters of galaxies have been found that date from as early as 3.9 billion years (3.9Gyr z = 1.62) after the Big Bang, containing stars that formed at even earlier epochs. Cosmological simulations using the current cold dark matter model predict that these systems should descend from `protoclusters'-early overdensities of massive galaxies that merge hierarchically to form a cluster. These protocluster regions themselves are built up hierarchically and so are expected to contain extremely massive galaxies that can be observed as luminous quasars and starbursts. Observational evidence for this picture, however, is sparse because high-redshift protoclusters are rare and difficult to observe. Here we report a protocluster region that dates from 1Gyr (z = 5.3) after the Big Bang. This cluster of massive galaxies extends over more than 13 megaparsecs and contains a luminous quasar as well as a system rich in molecular gas. These massive galaxies place a lower limit of more than 4{\times}10$^{11}$ solar masses of dark and luminous matter in this region, consistent with that expected from cosmological simulations for the earliest galaxy clusters.},

This conclusion is reached based on emerging data sets for ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/824/1/36/apj523272ieqn2.gif] {$z\gt 2$} proto-clusters and the characteristics of their member galaxies, in particular, rare starbursts and ultraluminous active galactic nuclei (AGN). The most challenging observational hurdle in identifying such structures is their very large volumes, ∼10 4 comoving Mpc 3 at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/824/1/36/apj523272ieqn3.gif] {$z\gt 2$} , subtending areas of approximately half a degree on the sky. Thus, the contrast afforded by an overabundance of very rare galaxies in comparison to the background can more easily distinguish overdense structures from the surrounding, normal density field. Five ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/824/1/36/apj523272ieqn4.gif] {$2\lesssim z\lesssim 3$} proto-clusters from the literature are discussed in detail and are found to contain up to 12 dusty starbursts or luminous AGN galaxies each, a phenomenon that is unlikely to occur by chance even in overdense environments. These are contrasted with three higher-redshift ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/824/1/36/apj523272ieqn5.gif] {$4\lesssim z\lesssim 5.5$} ) dusty star-forming galaxy (DSFG) groups, whose evolutionary fate is less clear. Measurements of DSFGs’ gas depletion times suggest that they are indeed short-lived on ∼100 Myr timescales, and accordingly the probability of finding a structure containing more than 8 such systems is ∼0.2%, unless their “triggering” is correlated on very large spatial scales, ∼10 Mpc across. The volume density of DSFG-rich proto-clusters is found to be comparable to all of the >10 15 M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/824/1/36/apj523272ieqn6.gif] {${}_{\odot }$} galaxy clusters in the nearby universe, which is a factor of five larger than expected in some simulations. Some tension still exists between measurements of the volume density of DSFG-rich proto-clusters and the expectation that they are generated via short-lived episodes, as the latter suggests that only a fraction ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/824/1/36/apj523272ieqn7.gif] {$\lt \tfrac{1}{2}$} ) of all proto-clusters should be rich with DSFGs. However, improved observations of proto-clusters over large regions of sky will certainly shed more light on the assembly of galaxy clusters, and whether or not they build their galaxies through episodic bursts as suggested here.},

We find 68 Hα emitters with dust-uncorrected star formation rates (SFRs) down to 8.6 M ☉ yr –1 . Their spatial distribution indicates that there are three prominent clumps of Hα emitters: one surrounding the radio galaxy, the second located at ~1.5 Mpc away to the southwest, and the third located between the two. These contiguous three systems are very likely to merge together in the near future and may grow to a single more massive cluster at a later time. While most Hα emitters reside in the "blue cloud" on the color-magnitude diagram, some emitters have very red colors with J – K s > 1.38(AB). Interestingly, such red Hα emitters are located toward the faint end of the red sequence, and they tend to be located in high density clumps. We do not see any statistically significant difference in the distributions of individual SFRs or stellar masses of the Hα emitters between the dense clumps and the other regions, suggesting that this is one of the notable sites where the progenitors of massive galaxies in the present-day clusters were in their vigorous formation phase. Finally, we find that Hα emission of the radio galaxy is fairly extended spatially over ~4 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/farcs.gif] {farcs} 5. However, it is not as widespread as its Lyα halo, meaning that the Lyα emission is indeed severely extended by resonant scattering.},

This review describes the current status of this field and highlights promising recent findings related to galaxy formation in the densest regions of the early universe. We discuss the main search techniques and the characteristic properties of protoclusters in observations and simulations, and show that protoclusters will have present-day masses similar to galaxy clusters when fully collapsed. We discuss the physical properties of galaxies in protoclusters, including (proto-)brightest cluster galaxies, and the forming red sequence. We highlight the fact that the most massive halos at high redshift are found in protoclusters, making these objects uniquely suited for testing important recent models of galaxy formation. We show that galaxies in protoclusters should be among the first galaxies at high redshift making the transition from a gas cooling regime dominated by cold streams to a regime dominated by hot intracluster gas, which could be tested observationally. We also discuss the possible connections between protoclusters and radio galaxies, quasars, and Ly{$\alpha$} blobs. Because of their early formation, large spatial sizes and high total star-formation rates, protoclusters have also likely played a crucial role during the epoch of reionization, which can be tested with future experiments that will map the neutral and ionized cosmic web. Lastly, we review a number of promising observational projects that are expected to make significant impact in this growing, exciting field.},

Not only are these SMGs members of the protocluster, but they in fact reside within the node at the junction of the 50 Mpc scale filamentary three-dimensional structure traced by Ly α emitters in this field. The eight SMGs account for a star formation rate density (SFRD) ∼10 M ⊙ yr −1 Mpc −3 in the node, which is two orders of magnitudes higher than the global SFRD at this redshift. We find that four of the eight SMGs host an X-ray-luminous active galactic nucleus. Our results suggest that the vigorous star formation activity and the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) occurred simultaneously in the densest regions at z ∼ 3, which may correspond to the most active historical phase of the massive galaxy population found in the core of the clusters in the present universe. Two SMGs are associated with Ly α blobs, implying that the two populations coexist in high-density environments for a few cases.},

  abstract = {We present 279 galaxy cluster candidates at z > 1.3 selected from the 94 deg 2 Spitzer South Pole Telescope Deep Field (SSDF) survey. We use a simple algorithm to select candidate high-redshift clusters of galaxies based on Spitzer /IRAC mid-infrared data combined with shallow all-sky optical data. We identify distant cluster candidates adopting an overdensity threshold that results in a high purity (80%) cluster sample based on tests in the Spitzer Deep, Wide-Field Survey of the Boötes field. Our simple algorithm detects all three 1.4 < z ≤ 1.75 X-ray detected clusters in the Boötes field. The uniqueness of the SSDF survey resides not just in its area, one of the largest contiguous extragalactic fields observed with Spitzer , but also in its deep, multi-wavelength coverage by the South Pole Telescope (SPT), Herschel /SPIRE, and XMM-Newton . This rich data set will allow direct or stacked measurements of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect decrements or X-ray masses for many of the SSDF clusters presented here, and enable a systematic study of the most distant clusters on an unprecedented scale. We measure the angular correlation function of our sample and find that these candidates show strong clustering. Employing the COSMOS/UltraVista photometric catalog in order to infer the redshift distribution of our cluster selection, we find that these clusters have a comoving number density ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/797/2/109/apj503986ieqn1.gif] {$n_c = (0.7^{+6.3}_{-0.6}) \times 10^{-7} \; h^{3} \;\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$} and a spatial clustering correlation scale length r 0 = (32 ± 7) h –1 Mpc. Assuming our sample is comprised of dark matter halos above a characteristic minimum mass, M min , we derive that at z = 1.5 these clusters reside in halos larger than ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/797/2/109/apj503986ieqn2.gif] {$M_{{\rm min}} = 1.5^{+0.9}_{-0.7} \times 10^{14}\; h^{-1} \; M_{\odot }$} .

  title       = {Using ALMA to resolve the nature of the early star-forming large-scale structure PLCK G073.4-57.5},
  abstract    = {Galaxy clusters at high redshifts are key targets for understanding matter assembly in the early Universe, yet they are challenging to locate. A sample of >2000 high-z candidate structures have been found using Planck's all-sky submm maps, and a subset of 234 have been followed up with Herschel-SPIRE, which showed that the emission can be attributed to large overdensities of dusty star-forming (SF) galaxies. However, the individual galaxies have not yet been resolved nor characterized, so we do not know whether they constitute the progenitors of present-day, massive galaxy clusters. We targeted the 8 brightest SPIRE sources in the centre of the Planck peak G073.4-57.5 using ALMA at 1.3mm, and complemented these observations with data from IRAC, WIRCam J,K, and SCUBA-2. We detect a total of 18 millimetre galaxies brighter than 0.3mJy in 2.4arcmin^2. The ALMA source density is 8-30 times higher than average background estimates, and larger than seen in typical "proto-cluster" fields. We are able to match all but one ALMA sources to their NIR counterparts. The most significant (four) SCUBA-2 sources are not included in the ALMA pointings, but we find an 8sigma stacking detection of the ALMA sources in the SCUBA-2 map at 850um. We derive photo-z, L_IR, SFR, M_*, T_dust, and M_dust for all the ALMA galaxies; the photo-zs are concentrated around z=1.5 and the near-IR colours show a "red" sequence, while the SFRs indicate that one third of the galaxies are "starbursts," the others being main-sequence (MS) SF galaxies. Serendipitous CO line detections of two of the galaxies appear to match their photo-zs, with z = 1.54. We thus find that the Planck peak G073.4-57.5 contains a proto-cluster candidate at z=1.54, and one of the richest regions of ALMA sources known. The ALMA-detected members are massive galaxies on the MS relation and account for a total SFR of at least 1000MSun/yr.},

  title       = {The Evolution of Star Formation Activity in Cluster Galaxies Over $0.15<z<1.5$},
  abstract    = {We explore 7.5 billion years of evolution in the star formation activity of massive ($M_{\star}>10^{10.1}\,M_{\odot}$) cluster galaxies using a sample of 25 clusters over $0.15<z<1$ from the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble and 11 clusters over $1<z<1.5$ from the IRAC Shallow Cluster Survey. Galaxy morphologies are determined visually using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope images. Using the spectral energy distribution fitting code CIGALE, we measure star formation rates, stellar masses, and 4000 \AA\ break strengths. The latter are used to separate quiescent and star-forming galaxies (SFGs). From $z\sim1.3$ to $z\sim0.2$, the specific star formation rate (sSFR) of cluster SFGs and quiescent galaxies decreases by factors of three and four, respectively. Over the same redshift range, the sSFR of the entire cluster population declines by a factor of 11, from $0.48\pm0.06\;\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1}$ to $0.043\pm0.009\;\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1}$. This strong overall sSFR evolution is driven by the growth of the quiescent population over time; the fraction of quiescent cluster galaxies increases from $28^{+8}_{-19}\%$ to $88^{+5}_{-4}\%$ over $z\sim1.3\rightarrow0.2$. The majority of the growth occurs at $z\gtrsim0.9$, where the quiescent fraction increases by 0.41. While the sSFR of the majority of star-forming cluster galaxies is at the level of the field, a small subset of cluster SFGs have low field-relative star formation activity, suggestive of long-timescale quenching. The large increase in the fraction of quiescent galaxies above $z\sim0.9$, coupled with the field-level sSFRs of cluster SFGs, suggests that higher redshift cluster galaxies are likely being quenched quickly. Assessing those timescales will require more accurate stellar population ages and star formation histories.},

  title       = {Star Formation in Intermediate Redshift 0.2 < z < 0.7 Brightest Cluster Galaxies},
  abstract    = {We present a multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic study of 42 Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) in two samples of galaxy clusters chosen for a gravitational lensing study. The study's initial sample combines 25 BCGs from the Cluster Lensing and Supernova Survey with Hubble (CLASH) sample and 37 BCGs from the Sloan Giant Arcs Survey (SGAS) with a total redshift range of 0.2 < z < 0.7. Using archival GALEX, Hubble Space Telescope, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Herschel, and Very Large Array data we determine the BCGs' stellar mass, radio power, and star formation rates. The radio power is higher than expected if due to star formation, consistent with the BCGs being active galactic nucleus (AGN)-powered radio sources. This suggests that the AGN and star formation are both fueled by cold gas in the host galaxy. The specific star formation rate (sSFR) is low and constant with redshift. The mean sSFR is 9.42 * 10^-12 yr^-1, which corresponds to a mass doubling time of 105 billion years. These findings are consistent with models for hierarchical formation of BCGs, which suggest that star formation is no longer a significant channel for galaxy growth for z < 1. Instead, stellar growth (of the order of a factor of at least two) during this period is expected to occur mainly via minor dry mergers},

  abstract    = {We present a search for nuclear X-ray emission in the Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) of a sample of groups and clusters of galaxies extracted from the Chandra archive. The exquisite angular resolution of Chandra allows us to obtain robust photometry at the position of the BCG, and to firmly identify unresolved X-ray emission when present, thanks to an accurate characterization of the extended emission at the BCG position. We consider two redshift bins (0.2<z<0.3 and 0.55<z<0.75) and analyze all the clusters observed by Chandra with exposure time larger than 20 ks. Our samples have 81 BCGs in 73 clusters and 51 BCGs in 49 clusters in the low- and high-redshift bin, respectively. X-ray emission in the soft (0.5-2 keV) or hard (2-7 keV) band is detected only in 14 and 9 BCGs ($\sim 18$% of the total samples), respectively. The X-ray photometry shows that at least half of the BCGs have a high hardness ratio, compatible with significant intrinsic absorption. This is confirmed by the spectral analysis with a power law model plus intrinsic absorption. We compute the fraction of X-ray bright BCGs above a given hard X-ray luminosity, considering only sources with positive photometry in the hard band (12/5 sources in the low/high-z sample). In the 0.2<z<0.3 interval the hard X-ray luminosity ranges from $10^{42}$ to $7 \times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, with most sources found below $10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. In the $0.55<z<0.75$ range, we find a similar distribution of luminosities below $\sim 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, plus two very bright sources of a few $10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ associated to two radio galaxies. We also find that X-ray luminous BCGs tend to be hosted by cool core clusters, despite the majority of cool cores do not host nuclear X-ray emission.},

  abstract      = {We report the discovery of a galaxy cluster at z = 1.62 located in the Spitzer Wide-Area Infrared Extragalactic survey XMM-LSS field. This structure was selected solely as an overdensity of galaxies with red Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera colors, satisfying ([3.6] - [4.5])$_{AB}$$\gt$ - 0.1 mag. Photometric redshifts derived from the Subaru XMM Deep Survey (BViz bands), the UKIRT Infrared Deep Survey-Ultra-Deep Survey (UKIDSS-UDS, JK bands), and from the Spitzer Public UDS survey (3.6-8.0 {$\mu$}m) show that this cluster corresponds to a surface density of galaxies at z {\ap} 1.6 that is $\gt$20{$\sigma$} above the mean at this redshift. We obtained optical spectroscopic observations of galaxies in the cluster region using IMACS on the Magellan telescope. We measured redshifts for seven galaxies in the range z = 1.62-1.63 within 2.8 arcmin ($\lt$1.4 Mpc) of the astrometric center of the cluster. A posteriori analysis of the XMM data in this field reveal a weak (4{$\sigma$}) detection in the [0.5-2 keV] band compatible with the expected thermal emission from such a cluster. The color-magnitude diagram of the galaxies in this cluster shows a prominent red sequence, dominated by a population of red galaxies with (z - J)$\gt$1.7 mag. The photometric-redshift probability distributions for the red galaxies are strongly peaked at z = 1.62, coincident with the spectroscopically confirmed galaxies. The rest-frame (U - B) color and scatter of galaxies on the red sequence are consistent with a mean luminosity-weighted age of 1.2 {\plusmn} 0.1 Gyr, yielding a formation redshift $\backslash$overline$\{$z\_f$\}$=2.35 {\plusmn} 0.10, and corresponding to the last significant star formation period in these galaxies.  This work is based in part on observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under NASA contract 1407. This paper also includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.

We refer to them as ``Bright, Compact Bulges'' (BCBs) - they resemble neither classical nor pseudo-bulges and constitute $\sim12$\% of the total bulge population at these redshifts. Examining free-bulge $+$ disc decomposition sample and elliptical galaxy sample from Simard et al. (2011), we find that only $\sim0.2$\% of the bulges can be classified as BCBs in the local Universe. Bulge to total ratio $(B/T)$ of disc galaxies with BCBs is (at $\sim0.4$) a factor of $\sim2$ and $\sim4$ larger than for those with classical and pseudo bulges. BCBs are $\sim2.5$ and $\sim6$ times more massive than classical and pseudo bulges. Although disc galaxies with BCBs host the most massive and dominant bulge type, their specific star formation rate is $1.5-2$ times higher than other disc galaxies. This is contrary to the expectations that a massive compact bulge would lead to lower star formation rates. We speculate that our BCB host disc galaxies are descendant of massive, compact and passive elliptical galaxies observed at higher redshifts. Those high redshift ellipticals lack local counterparts and possibly evolved by acquiring a compact disc around them. The overall properties of BCBs supports a picture of galaxy assembly in which younger discs are being accreted around massive pre-existing spheroids.},

  abstract = {Massive galaxy clusters have been found that date to times as early as three billion years after the Big Bang, containing stars that formed at even earlier epochs1-3. The high-redshift progenitors of these galaxy clusters--termed ‘protoclusters’--can be identified in cosmological simulations that have the highest overdensities (greater-than-average densities) of dark matter4-6. Protoclusters are expected to contain extremely massive galaxies that can be observed as luminous starbursts                  7                . However, recent detections of possible protoclusters hosting such starbursts8-11 do not support the kind of rapid cluster-core formation expected from simulations                  12                : the structures observed contain only a handful of starbursting galaxies spread throughout a broad region, with poor evidence for eventual collapse into a protocluster. Here we report observations of carbon monoxide and ionized carbon emission from the source SPT2349-56. We find that this source consists of at least 14 gas-rich galaxies, all lying at redshifts of 4.31. We demonstrate that each of these galaxies is forming stars between 50 and 1,000 times more quickly than our own Milky Way, and that all are located within a projected region that is only around 130 kiloparsecs in diameter. This galaxy surface density is more than ten times the average blank-field value (integrated over all redshifts), and more than 1,000 times the average field volume density. The velocity dispersion (approximately 410 kilometres per second) of these galaxies and the enormous gas and star-formation densities suggest that this system represents the core of a cluster of galaxies that was already at an advanced stage of formation when the Universe was only 1.4 billion years old. A comparison with other known protoclusters at high redshifts shows that SPT2349-56 could be building one of the most massive structures in the Universe today.},

Based on our nearly continuous, line-free spectra from 200-670 $\mu$m, the calculated bolometric luminosities ($L\_{\rm bol}$) increase by 50\% on average, and the bolometric temperatures ($T\_{\rm bol}$) decrease by 10\% on average, in comparison with the measurements without Herschel. Fifteen protostars have the same Class using $T\_{\rm bol}$ and $L\_{\rm bol}$/$L\_{\rm submm}$. We identify rotational transitions of CO lines from J=4-3 to J=13-12, along with emission lines of $^{13}$CO, HCO$^+$, H$\_{2}$O, and [CI]. The ratios of $^{12}$CO to $^{13}$CO indicate that $^{12}$CO emission remains optically thick for $J\_{\rm up}$ $\lt$ 13. We fit up to four components of temperature from the rotational diagram with flexible break points to separate the components. The distribution of rotational temperatures shows a primary population around 100 K with a secondary population at $\sim$350 K. We quantify the correlations of each line pair found in our dataset, and find the strength of correlation of CO lines decreases as the difference between $J$-level between two CO lines increases. The multiple origins of CO emission previously revealed by velocity-resolved profiles are consistent with this smooth distribution if each physical component contributes to a wide range of CO lines with significant overlap in the CO ladder. We investigate the spatial extent of CO emission and find that the morphology is more centrally peaked and less bipolar at high-$J$ lines. We find the CO emission observed with SPIRE related to outflows, which consists two components, the entrained gas and shocked gas, as revealed by our rotational diagram analysis as well as the studies with velocity-resolved CO emission.},

  abstract    = {We construct a model for cosmic ray acceleration from protostellar accretion shocks and calculate the resulting cosmic ray ionization rate within star-forming molecular clouds. We couple a protostar cluster model with an analytic accretion shock model to calculate the cosmic ray acceleration from protostellar surfaces. We present the cosmic ray flux spectrum from keV to GeV energies for a typical low-mass protostar. We find that at the shock surface the spectrum follows a power-law trend across 6 orders of magnitude in energy. After attenuation, the spectrum at high energies steepens, while at low energies it is relatively flat. We calculate the cosmic ray pressure and cosmic ray ionization rate from relativistic protons at the protostellar surface and at the edge of the core. We present the cosmic ray ionization rate for individual protostars as a function of their instantaneous mass and final mass. The protostellar cosmic ray ionization rate is $\zeta \approx 0.01 - 1$ s$^{-1}$ at the accretion shock surface. However, at the edge of the core, the cosmic ray ionization rate drops substantially to between $\zeta \approx 10^{-20}$ to $10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$. There is a large spatial gradient in the cosmic ray ionization rate, such that inner regions may experience cosmic ray ionization rates larger than the often assumed fiducial rate, $\zeta = 3\times10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$. Finally, we calculate the cosmic ray ionization rate for protostellar clusters over 5 orders of magnitude of cluster size. We find that clusters with more than approximately 200 protostars produce a higher cosmic ray ionization rate within their natal cloud than the fiducial galactic value.},

The new Cepheids are unique in probing the kinematics and metallicity of young stars at the transition between the inner Disk and the minor axis of the central Bar, where they are expected to be less affected by its dynamical influence.This is also the first time that metallicity of Cepheids is estimated on the basis of medium-resolution ($R\sim3,000$) NIR spectra, and we validated our results with data in the literature, finding a minimal dependence on the adopted spectroscopic diagnostics. This result is very promising for using Cepheids as stellar proxy of the present-time chemical content of the obscured regions in the Disk. We found that the three Cepheids within 8--10 kpc from us have metallicities consistent with the mean radial metallicity gradient, and kinematics consistent with the Galactic rotation curve. Instead, the closest ($\sim$4 kpc)/farthest ($\sim$12 kpc) Cepheids have significant negative/positive residuals, both in velocity and in iron content. We discuss the possibility that such residuals are related to large-scale dynamical instabilities, induced by the bar/spiral-arm pattern, but the current sample is too limited to reach firm conclusions.},

  abstract    = {We study the scaling relations between the baryonic content and total mass of groups of galaxies, as these systems provide a unique way to examine the role of non-gravitational processes in structure formation. Using Planck and ROSAT data, we conduct detailed comparisons of the stacked thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect and X-ray scaling relations of galaxy groups found in the the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey and the BAHAMAS hydrodynamical simulation. We use weak gravitational lensing data from the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) to determine the average halo mass of the studied systems. We analyse the simulation in the same way, using realistic weak lensing, X-ray, and tSZ synthetic observations. Furthermore, to keep selection biases under control, we employ exactly the same galaxy selection and group identification procedures to the observations and simulation. Applying this careful comparison, we find that the simulations are in agreement with the observations, particularly with regards to the scaling relations of the lensing and tSZ results. This finding demonstrates that hydrodynamical simulation have reached the level of realism that is required to interpret observational survey data and study the baryon physics within dark matter haloes, where analytical modelling is challenging. Finally, using simulated data, we demonstrate that our observational processing of the X-ray and tSZ signals is free of significant biases. We find that our optical group selection procedure has, however, some room for improvement.},

  __markedentry = {[ling:3]},
  abstract      = {The incidence of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with local environment is a potentially valuable probe of the mechanisms that trigger and provide fuel for accretion onto supermassive black holes. While the correlation between AGN fraction and environment has been well-studied in the local universe, AGN fractions have been measured for relatively few dense environments at high redshift. In this paper we present a measurement of the X-ray AGN fraction in the USS 1558-003 protocluster associated with the z=2.53 radio galaxy 4C-00.62. Our measurement is based on a 100ks Chandra observation, follow-up spectroscopy from the Multi-Object Double Spectrograph on the Large Binocular Telescope, and broad and narrow band photometry. These data are sensitive to AGN more luminous than $L_{X}>2\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the rest-frame hard X-ray band (2-10 keV). We have identified two X-ray AGN at the redshift of USS 1558-003, one of which is the radio galaxy. We have determined that $2.0^{+2.6}_{-1.3}$% of the H$\alpha$ emitters in the protocluster are X-ray AGN. Unlike most other high-redshift cluster progenitors studied with similar techniques, USS 1558-003 does not have a significantly higher fraction of AGN than field galaxies at similar redshifts. This lower AGN fraction is inconsistent with the expectation that the higher gas fractions at high redshift, combined with the high galaxy densities and modest relative velocities in protoclusters, should produce higher AGN fractions.},

  abstract    = {The Coma supercluster (100 Mpc) offers an unprecedented contiguous range of environments in the nearby Universe. In this paper we present a catalogue of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies in the Coma supercluster detected in the ultraviolet (UV) wavebands. We use the arsenal of UV and optical data for galaxies in the Coma supercluster covering ~ 500 square degrees on the sky to study their photometric and spectroscopic properties as a function of environment at various scales. We identify the different components of the cosmic-web: large-scale filaments and voids using Discrete Persistent Structures Extractor, and groups and clusters using Hierarchical Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, respectively. We find that in the Coma supercluster the median emission in Halpha inclines, while the g-r and FUV-NUV colours of galaxies become bluer moving further away from the spine of the filaments out to a radius of around 1 Mpc. On the other hand, an opposite trend is observed as the distance between the galaxy and centre of the nearest cluster or group decreases. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that properties of galaxies are not just defined by its stellar mass and large-scale density, but also by the environmental processes resulting due to the intrafilament medium whose role in accelerating galaxy transformations needs to be investigated thoroughly using multi-wavelength data.},

  abstract    = {We used optical imaging and spectroscopic data to derive substructure estimates for local Universe ($z < 0.11$) galaxy clusters from two different samples. The first was selected through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect by the Planck satellite and the second is an X-ray selected sample. In agreement to X-ray substructure estimates we found that the SZ systems have a larger fraction of substructure than the X-ray clusters. We have also found evidence that the higher mass regime of the SZ clusters, compared to the X-ray sample, explains the larger fraction of disturbed objects in the Planck data. Although we detect a redshift evolution in the substructure fraction, it is not sufficient to explain the different results between the higher-z SZ sample and the X-ray one. We have also verified a good agreement ($\sim$60$\%$) between the optical and X-ray substructure estimates. However, the best level of agreement is given by the substructure classification given by measures based on the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), either the BCG$-$X-ray centroid offset, or the magnitude gap between the first and second BCGs. We advocate the use of those two parameters as the most reliable and cheap way to assess cluster dynamical state. We recommend an offset cut of $\sim$0.01$\times$R$_{500}$ to separate relaxed and disturbed clusters. Regarding the magnitude gap the separation can be done at $\Delta m_{12} = 1.0$. The central galaxy paradigm (CGP) may not be valid for $\sim$20$\%$ of relaxed massive clusters. This fraction increases to $\sim$60$\%$ for disturbed systems.},

  abstract      = {We develop the Blooming Tree Algorithm, a new technique that uses spectroscopic redshift data alone to identify the substructures and the surrounding groups of galaxy clusters, along with their member galaxies. Based on the estimated binding energy of galaxy pairs, the algorithm builds a binary tree that hierarchically arranges all the galaxies in the field of view. The algorithm searches for buds, corresponding to gravitational potential minima on the binary tree branches; for each bud, the algorithm combines the number of galaxies, their velocity dispersion and their average pairwise distance into a parameter that discriminates between the buds that do not correspond to any substructure or group, and thus eventually die, and the buds that correspond to substructures and groups, and thus bloom into the identified structures. We test our new algorithm with a sample of 300 mock redshift surveys of clusters in different dynamical states; the clusters are extracted from a large cosmological $N$-body simulation of a $\Lambda$CDM model. We limit our analysis to substructures and surrounding groups identified in the simulation with mass larger than $10^{13} h^{-1} M\_{\odot}$. With mock redshift surveys with 200 galaxies within 6 $h^{-1}$\~{}Mpc from the cluster center, the technique recovers $ 80$$\backslash$\% of the real substructures and $ 60$$\backslash$\% of the surrounding groups; in $57$$\backslash$\% of the identified structures, at least 60$\backslash$\% of the member galaxies of the substructures and groups belong to the same real structure. These results improve by roughly a factor of two the performance of the best substructure identification algorithm currently available, the $\sigma$ plateau algorithm, and suggest that our Blooming Tree Algorithm can be an invaluable tool for detecting substructures of galaxy clusters and investigating their complex dynamics.},

These kinematic alignment angles are further associated with the directions of the two distinct axes of the Virgo cluster extending east-west and north-south, strongly suggesting that the two distinct axes are the filamentary structures within the cluster as a trace of infall patterns of galaxies. Given that the spin axis of a massive early-type galaxy does not change easily even in clusters from the hydrodynamic simulations, Virgo early-type galaxies are likely to fall into the cluster along the filamentary structures while maintaining their angular momentum. This implies that many early-type galaxies in clusters are formed in filaments via major mergers before subsequently falling into the cluster. Investigating the kinematic alignment in other clusters will allow us to understand the formation of galaxy clusters and early-type galaxies.},

This work describes the first CO detection from $1\ltz\lt1.4$ star forming cluster galaxies with no reported clear evidence of AGN. We exploit observations taken with the NOEMA interferometer at $\sim3$ mm to detect CO(2-1) line emission from the two selected galaxies, unresolved by our observations. Based on the CO(2-1) spectrum we estimate a total molecular gas mass $M({\rm H\_2})=(2.2^{+0.5}\_{-0.4})\times10^{10}$ $M\_\odot$ and dust mass $M\_{\rm dust}\lt4.2\times10^8~M\_\odot$ for the two blended sources. The two galaxies have similar stellar masses and a large relative velocity of $\sim$400 km/s estimated from the CO(2-1) line width. These findings tend to privilege a scenario where both sources contribute to the observed CO(2-1). By using the archival Spitzer MIPS flux at 24$\mu$m we estimate an ${\rm SFR(24\mu m)}=(28^{+12}\_{-8})~M\_\odot$/yr for each of the two galaxies. Assuming that the two sources equally contribute to the observe CO(2-1) our analysis yields a depletion time scale $\tau\_{\rm dep}=(3.9^{+1.4}\_{-1.8})\times10^8$ yr, and a molecular gas to stellar mass ratio $0.17\pm0.13$ for each of two sources, separately. Our results are in overall agreement with those of other distant cluster galaxies. The two target galaxies have molecular gas mass and depletion time that are marginally compatible with, but smaller than those of main sequence field galaxies, suggesting that the molecular gas has not been refueled enough. Higher resolution and higher frequency observations will enable us to spatially resolve the two sources and possibly distinguish between different gas processing mechanisms.},

These clusters, taken from a mass-limited sample with a nearly redshift independent selection function, have multi-wavelength follow-up imaging data from the X-ray to near-infrared, and currently form the most homogeneous massive high-redshift cluster sample known. We identify 44 member galaxies, along with 25 field galaxies, among the five clusters, and describe the full set of observations and data products from Magellan/LDSS3 multi-object spectroscopy of these cluster fields. We briefly describe the analysis pipeline, and present ensemble analyses of cluster member galaxies that demonstrate the reliability of the measured redshifts. We report z=1.259,1.288,1.316,1.401 and 1.474 for the five clusters from a combination of absorption-line (Ca II H&K doublet - 3968,3934 {\AA}) and emission-line ([OII] 3727,3729 {\AA}) spectral features. Moreover, the calculated velocity dispersions yield dynamical cluster masses in good agreement with SZ masses for these clusters. We discuss the velocity and spatial distributions of passive and [OII]-emitting galaxies in these clusters, showing that they are consistent with velocity segregation and biases observed in lower redshift SPT clusters. We identify modest [OII] emission and pronounced CN and Hδ absorption in a stacked spectrum of 28 passive galaxies with Ca II H&K-derived redshifts. This work increases the number of spectroscopically-confirmed SZ-selected galaxy clusters at z>1.25 from three to eight, further demonstrating the efficacy of SZ selection for the highest redshift massive clusters, and enabling detailed study of these systems.},

Also, we find a strong dependence of the lensing signal on the group concentration parameter, with the most concentrated quintile showing a significant lensing signal, consistent with an isothermal sphere with $\sigma\_V =336 \pm 28$ km/s and a NFW profile with $R\_{200}=0.60\pm0.05$ $h\_{70}^{-1}$Mpc. We also compare lensing results with dynamical estimates finding a good agreement with lensing determinations for CGs with higher surface brightness and higher concentration indexes. On the other hand, CGs that are more contaminated by interlopers show larger dynamical dispersions, since interlopers bias dynamical estimates to larger values, although the lensing signal is weakened.},

We present a Chandra X-ray observation of our first newly discovered low-redshift (z = 0.223) galaxy cluster with a central X-ray bright point source, PKS1353-341. After removing the point source contribution to the cluster core, we determine various properties of the cluster. The presence of a relaxed X-ray morphology, a central temperature drop, and a central cooling time around 400 Myr points to it being a strong cool-core cluster. The central galaxy appears to be forming stars at the rate of 6.2+/-3.6 Msun/yr, corresponding to \~{}1\% of the classical cooling prediction. The supermassive black hole in the central galaxy appear to be accreting at \~{}0.1\% of the Eddington rate with the total power output of \~{}5x10\^{}45 erg/s, split nearly equally between radiative and mechanical power. Comparing the cluster's bulk properties with those of other known clusters (e.g., M\_500 = 6.9(+4.3)(-2.6)x10\^{}14 Msun, and L\_X = 7x10\^{}44 erg/s), we show that this cluster is sufficiently luminous that it would have been identified as a cluster in the ROSAT All Sky-Survey data, if it did not have such a bright central point source. This discovery demonstrates the potential of the CHiPS survey to find massive nearby clusters with extreme central properties that may have been missed or misidentified by previous surveys.},

  abstract    = {To investigate the dynamics of the galaxy cluster A2142, we compile an extended catalog of 2239 spectroscopic redshifts of sources, including newly measured 237 redshifts, within 30 arcmin from the cluster center. With the $\sigma$-plateau algorithm from the caustic method, we identify 868 members and a number of substructures in the galaxy distribution both in the outskirts, out to $\sim$3.5 Mpc from the cluster center, and in the central region. In the outskirts, one substructure overlaps a falling clump of gas previously identified in the X-ray band. These substructures suggests the presence of multiple minor mergers, which are responsible for the complex dynamics of A2142, and the absence of recent or ongoing major mergers. We show that the distribution of the galaxies in the cluster core and in several substructures are consistent with the mass distribution inferred from the weak lensing signal. Moreover, we use spatially-resolved X-ray spectroscopy to measure the redshift of different regions of the intracluster medium within $\sim$3 arcmin from the cluster center. We find a ring of gas near the two X-ray cold fronts identified in previous analyses and measure a velocity of this ring of $810 \pm 330 {\rm km s^{-1}}$ larger than the cluster mean velocity. Our analysis suggests the presence of another ring surrounding the core, whose velocity is $660 \pm 300 {\rm km s^{-1}}$ larger than the cluster velocity. These X-ray features are not associated to any optical substructures, and support the core-sloshing scenario suggested in previous work.},

Only half of this AGN overdensity is due to the overdensity of massive galaxies in the protocluster (a factor of 11 {\plusmn} 2), as we find that 17\^{}$\{$+6$\}$\_$\{$-5$\}$ per cent of massive galaxies (M$_{*}$ $\gt$ 10$^{10}$ M$_{⊙}$) in the protocluster host an X-ray luminous AGN, compared to 8 {\plusmn} 1 per cent in the field. This corresponds to an enhancement of AGN activity in massive protocluster galaxies by a factor of 2.1 {\plusmn} 0.7 at 1.6{$\sigma$} significance. We also find that the AGN overdensity is centrally concentrated, located within 3 arcmin and most pronounced within 1 arcmin of the centre of the protocluster. Our results confirm that there is a reversal in the local anticorrelation between galaxy density and AGN activity, so there is an enhancement of AGN in high-redshift protoclusters. We compare the properties of AGN in the protocluster to the field and find no significant differences in the distributions of their stellar mass, X-ray luminosity or hardness ratio. We therefore suggest that triggering mechanisms are similar in both environments, and that the mechanisms simply occur more frequently in denser environments.},

  abstract      = {Intra-cluster (IC) populations are expected to be a natural result of the hierarchical assembly of clusters, yet their low space densities make them difficult to detect and study. We present the first definitive kinematic detection of an IC population of globular clusters (GCs) in the Virgo cluster, around the central galaxy, M87. This study focuses on the Virgo core for which the combination of NGVS photometry and follow-up spectroscopy allows us to reject foreground star contamination and explore GC kinematics over the full Virgo dynamical range. The GC kinematics changes gradually with galactocentric distance, decreasing in mean velocity and increasing in velocity dispersion, eventually becoming indistinguishable from the kinematics of Virgo dwarf galaxies at $\mathrm{R\gt320\, kpc}$. By kinematically tagging M87 halo and intra-cluster GCs we find that 1) the M87 halo has a smaller fraction ($52\pm3\\%$) of blue clusters with respect to the IC counterpart ($77\pm10\\%$), 2) the $(g'-r')\_{0}$ vs $(i'-z')\_{0}$ color-color diagrams reveal a galaxy population that is redder than the IC population that may be due to a different composition in chemical abundance and progenitor mass, and 3) the ICGC distribution is shallower and more extended than the M87 GCs, yet still centrally concentrated. The ICGC specific frequency, $S\_{N,\mathrm{ICL}}=10.2\pm4.8$, is consistent with what is observed for the population of quenched, low-mass galaxies within 1\~{}Mpc from the cluster's center. The IC population at Virgo's center is thus consistent with being an accreted component from low-mass galaxies tidally stripped or disrupted through interactions, with a total mass of $\mathrm{M\_{ICL,tot}=10.8\pm0.1\times10^{11}M\_{\odot}}$.},

Using the X-ray surface brightness of the clusters from deep Chandra data to model their hot gas, we are able to disentangle this mass term from the diffuse dark matter in our new strong-lensing analysis, with approximately $50$-$100$ secure multiple images per cluster, effectively separating the collisional and collisionless mass components of the clusters. At a radial distance of $10\\%$ of $R\_{200\textrm{c}}$ (approximately $200$ kpc), we measure a projected total mass of $(0.129 \pm 0.001)$, $(0.131 \pm 0.001)$ and $(0.137 \pm 0.001)\times M\_{200\textrm{c}}$, for RXC J2248, MACS J0416 and MACS J1206, respectively. These values are surprisingly similar, considering the large differences in the merging configurations, and, as a consequence, in the mass models of the clusters. Interestingly, at the same radii, the hot gas over total mass fractions differ substantially, ranging from $0.082 \pm 0.001$ to $0.133 \pm 0.001$, reflecting the various dynamical states of the clusters. Moreover, we do not find a statistically significant offset between the positions of the peak of the diffuse dark matter component and of the BCG in the more complex clusters of the sample. We extend to this sample of clusters previous findings of a number of massive sub-halos higher than in numerical simulations. These results highlight the importance of a proper separation of the different mass components to study in detail the properties of dark matter in galaxy clusters.},

  abstract    = {We derive NUV luminosity functions for 6471 NUV detected galaxies in 28 $0.02 < z < 0.08$ clusters and consider their dependence on cluster properties. We consider optically red and blue galaxies and explore how their NUV LFs vary in several cluster subsamples, selected to best show the influence of environment. Our composite LF is well fit by the Schechter form with $M^*_{NUV}=-18.98 \pm 0.07$ and $\alpha=-1.87 \pm 0.03$ in good agreement with values for the Coma centre and the Shapley supercluster, but with a steeper slope and brighter $L^*$ than in Virgo. The steep slope is due to the contribution of massive quiescent galaxies that are faint in the NUV. There are significant differences in the NUV LFs for clusters having low and high X-ray luminosities and for sparse and dense clusters, though none are particularly well fitted by the Schechter form, making a physical interpretation of the parameters difficult. When splitting clusters into two subsamples by X-ray luminosity, the ratio of low to high NUV luminosity galaxies is higher in the high X-ray luminosity subsample (i.e the luminosity function is steeper across the sampled luminosity range). In subsamples split by surface density, when characterised by Schechter functions the dense clusters have an $M^*$ about a magnitude fainter than that of the sparse clusters and $\alpha$ is steeper ($-1.9$ vs. $-1.6$ respectively). The differences in the data appear to be driven by changes in the LF of blue (star-forming) galaxies. This appears to be related to interactions with the cluster gas [abridged]},

Two subsystems, A2033 and a Southern Infalling Group (SIG) appear in the infall region based on the spectroscopy as well as on the weak lensing and X-ray maps. The complete redshift survey of A2029 also identifies at least 12 foreground and background systems (10 are extended X-ray sources) in the A2029 field; we include a census of their properties. The X-ray luminosities $L\_{X}$ - velocity dispersions ($\sigma\_{cl}$) scaling relations for A2029, A2033, SIG, and the foreground/background systems are consistent with the known cluster scaling relations. The combined spectroscopy, weak lensing, and X-ray observations provide a robust measure of the masses of A2029, A2033, and SIG. The total mass of the infalling groups (A2033 and SIG) is $\sim 60\\%$ of the M200 of the primary cluster, A2029. Simple dynamical consid- erations suggest that A2029 will accrete these subsystems in next few Gyr. In agreement with simulations and with other clusters observed in a similar redshift range, the total mass in the A2029 infall region is comparable with the A2029 M200 and will mostly be accreted in the long-term future.},

In this paper we present deep 1--4 GHz VLA observations of CIZA$\backslash$,J2242.8+5301 ($z=0.1921$), a double radio relic cluster characterized by small projection on the plane of the sky. Our VLA observations reveal, for the first time, the complex morphology of the diffuse sources and the filamentary structure of the northern relic. We discover new faint diffuse radio emission extending north of the main northern relic. Our Mach number estimates for the northern and southern relics, based on the radio spectral index map obtained using the VLA observations and existing LOFAR and GMRT data, are consistent with previous radio and X-ray studies ($\mathcal{M}\_{\rm RN}=2.58\pm0.17$ and $\mathcal{M}\_{\rm RS}=2.10\pm0.08$). However, color-color diagrams and modelings suggest a flatter injection spectral index than the one obtained from the spectral index map, indicating that projection effects might be not entirely negligible. The southern relic consists of five ``arms''. Embedded in it, we find a tailed radio galaxy which seems to be connected to the relic. A spectral index flattening, where the radio tail connects to the relic, is also measured. We propose that the southern relic may trace AGN fossil electrons that are re-accelerated at a shock, with an estimated strength of $\mathcal{M}=2.4$. High-resolution mapping of other tailed radio galaxies also supports a scenario where AGN fossil electrons are revived by the merger event and could be related to the formation of some diffuse cluster radio emission.},

None of the tests employed to study the cluster galaxies kinematics in the 1D (velocity information), 2D (spatial information), and 3D (combined velocity and spatial information) domains is able to detect significant substructures. While this picture is in agreement with previous results based on X-ray data and on the existence of the central cool core, we do not find any evidence of a merging process responsible for the radio halo discovered in this cluster. Thus, this radio halo remains an open problem that raises doubts about our understanding of diffuse radio sources in clusters.},

Magnetic fields and relativistic particles are mixed with the gas as revealed by giant `radio haloes', which arise from diffuse, megaparsec-scale synchrotron radiation at cluster centre. Radio haloes require that the emitting electrons are accelerated in situ (by turbulence), or are injected (as secondary particles) by proton collisions into the intergalactic medium. They are found only in a fraction of massive clusters that have complex dynamics, which suggests a connection between these mechanisms and cluster mergers. Here we report a radio halo at low frequencies associated with the merging cluster Abell521. This halo has an extremely steep radio spectrum, which implies a high frequency cut-off; this makes the halo difficult to detect with observations at 1.4GHz (the frequency at which all other known radio haloes have been best studied). The spectrum of the halo is inconsistent with a secondary origin of the relativistic electrons, but instead supports turbulent acceleration, which suggests that many radio haloes in the Universe should emit mainly at low frequencies.},

Their occurrence and spectral properties are poorly studied. In this work we present a broadband study of the radio relic in the galaxy cluster Abell 4038 using the Upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). We present the uGMRT images in the bands 300 - 500 MHz and 1050 - 1450 MHz having rms noise $70\,\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ and $30\,\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$, respectively, that are the deepest images of this field so far. A spectral analysis of the relic over 300 - 1450 MHz using images in sub-bands scaled to have constant fractional bandwidths to achieve a closely matched uv-coverage was carried out. The 100 kpc extent of the relic is divided into Loop, Arc, Bridge and North-end. The Loop has a steep spectral index of $\alpha=2.3\pm0.2$ ($S\_{\nu}\propto\nu^{-\alpha}$). The North-end has ultra-steep spectra in the range $2.4 - 3.7$. The Arc is found to skirt a curved region seen in the $\backslash$emph$\{$Chandra$\}$ X-ray surface brightness image and the highest spectral curvature in it reaches $1.6\pm0.3$. We interpret the morphology and spectral properties of the relic in the scenario of an adiabatically compressed cocoon from the past activity of the Brightest Cluster Galaxy in the cluster. A comparison of the properties of the A4038 relic with a sample of 10 such relics is discussed.},

Also known as radio relics, these regions of diffuse radio emission are thought to trace relativistic electrons in the intracluster plasma accelerated by low-Mach-number shocks generated by cluster-cluster merger events$^{ 3 }$. A long-standing problem is how low-Mach-number shocks can accelerate electrons so efficiently to explain the observed radio relics. Here, we report the discovery of a direct connection between a radio relic and a radio galaxy in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 3411-3412 by combining radio, X-ray and optical observations. This discovery indicates that fossil relativistic electrons from active galactic nuclei are re-accelerated at cluster shocks. It also implies that radio galaxies play an important role in governing the non-thermal component of the intracluster medium in merging clusters.},

Unfortunately, the cluster is very irregular, making it difficult to model the distribution of mass within it, and therefore impossible to determine its content of dark matter. X-ray observations offer a way around this problem, by revealing the hot, diffuse gas that is thought to fill the cluster's gravitational potential well in a way that closely matches the total distribution of mass$^{12}$. Here we report X-ray images of Virgo, obtained with the Rosat observatory, which show hot luminous gas extending over most of the optically visible cluster. The data show that a large part of the mass of the cluster is centred on the galaxy M87, with smaller concentrations around M86 and M49. Our results for M86 support the recent suggestion$^{3}$ that it is part of a small group of galaxies that is merging with the main cluster.},

Thus, the investigation of galaxies orientation constitute a standard test of galaxies formation scenarios since observed variations in angular momentum represent fundamental constraints for any model of galaxy formation. We have improved the method of analysis of the alignment of galaxies in clusters. Now, the method allowed analysis both position angles of galaxy major axes and two angles describing the spatial orientation of galaxies. The distributions of analyzed angles were tested for isotropy by applying different statistical tests. For sample of analyzed clusters we have computed the mean values of analyzed statistics, checking whether they are the same as expected ones in the case of random distribution of analyzed angles. The detailed discussion of this method has been performed. We have shown how to proceed in many particular cases in order to improve the statistical reasoning when analyzing the distribution of the angles in the observational data. Separately, we have compared these new results with those obtained from numerical simulations. We show the powerful of our method on the example of galaxy orientation analysis in 247 Abell rich galaxy clusters. We have found that the orientations of galaxies in analyzed clusters are not random. It means that we genuinely confirmed an existence of the alignment of galaxies in rich Abells' galaxy clusters. This result is independent from the clusters of Bautz-Morgan types.},

  abstract      = {As a young massive cluster in the Central Molecular Zone, the Arches cluster is a valuable probe of the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) in the extreme Galactic Center environment. We use multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope observations to obtain high-precision proper motion and photometric measurements of the cluster, calculating cluster membership probabilities for stars down to 1.8 M$\_{\odot}$ between cluster radii of 0.25 pc -- 3.0 pc. We achieve a cluster sample with just \~{}8\% field contamination, a significant improvement over photometrically-selected samples which are severely compromised by the differential extinction across the field. Combining this sample with K-band spectroscopy of 5 cluster members, we forward model the Arches cluster to simultaneously constrain its IMF and other properties (such as age and total mass) while accounting for observational uncertainties, completeness, mass segregation, and stellar multiplicity. We find that the Arches IMF is best described by a 1-segment power law that is significantly top-heavy: $\alpha$ = 1.76 $\pm$ 0.03 (stat) $\pm$ 0.05 (sys), where dN/dm $\propto$ m$^{-\alpha}$, though we cannot discount a 2-segment power law model with a high-mass slope only slightly shallower than local star forming regions ($\alpha$ = 2.10 $\pm$ 0.11 $\pm$ 0.02) but with a break at 5.16$^{+1.25}\_{-0.65}$ $\pm$ 0.08 M$\_{\odot}$. In either case, the Arches IMF is significantly different than the standard IMF. Comparing the Arches to other young massive clusters in the Milky Way, we find tentative evidence for a systematically top-heavy IMF at the Galactic Center.},

  abstract      = {Virgo is a dynamically young galaxy cluster with substructure in its spatial and kinematic distribution. Here, we simultaneously study the phase-space distribution and the main characteristics of Virgo's galaxies, particularly its most abundant galaxy population - the early-type dwarfs - to understand their environmental transformation histories. Aside from known correlations with morphological types - like the larger average clustercentric distance of late-type galaxies - we find an intriguing behavior of early types with magnitudes -17 $\gt$= M\_r $\gt$= -18. They show a large velocity spread and an asymmetric phase-space distribution, similar to the late-type galaxies and different from the early types just one magnitude brighter/fainter. Furthermore, we find a close phase-space aggregation of early-type dwarfs at large clustercentric distance and high relative velocity. Nearly all of them show signatures of disk components and their colors imply stellar ages that are younger than the population average. They are not located closely together but spread azimuthally around the cluster center. We show that this is expected from simulations of an infalling galaxy group that slowly gets dispersed after its first pericentric passage. We thus conclude that these galaxies are recent arrivals, and that the peculiar phase-space distribution of early-type dwarfs is evidence for the ongoing growth of this galaxy population. Studying galaxies based on their phase space correlations is a unique way to compare the properties of recent and older cluster members, and to understand which environment most influenced their present-day characteristics.},

  abstract      = {Shock waves provide a way to understand the merger configuration of galaxy clusters from X-ray data, e.g. constraining velocities of merging subclusters, even if the energy resolution of an instrument is not sufficient to measure the gas velocities directly via the Doppler effect. One of the pure geometrical proxies to the shock Mach number is the standoff distance, i.e. the distance between the leading edge of the shock and the contact discontinuity. In this work, we systematically investigate various effects that influence the estimates of the shock Mach number for a minor merger. These effects include (1) the gravitational potential well of the main cluster (causing acceleration/deceleration of the infalling subcluster), (2) the density and pressure gradients of the atmosphere in the main cluster, (3) the non-spherical shape of the subcluster, and (4) projection effects. The bias in the derived Mach number caused by the first two effects has opposite signs for the pre- and post-merger stages. Particularly, in the post-merger stage, the shock could be much farther away from the subcluster than predicted by a model of a rigid sphere moving at a constant speed in a uniform medium. This implies that a combination of the standoff distance with measurements of the Mach number from density/temperature jumps can differentiate between the pre- and post-merger stages, at least when the merger axis is close to the plane of sky or if the merger axis angle to the line of sight can be inferred.},
