We present our public code hyperz, which is presently available on the web. We introduce the method and we discuss the expected influence of the different observational conditions and theoretical assumptions. In particular, the set of templates used in the minimization procedure (age, metallicity, reddening, absorption in the Lyman forest,...) is studied in detail, through both real and simulated data. The expected accuracy of photometric redshifts, as well as the fraction of catastrophic identifications and wrong detections, is given as a function of the redshift range, the set of filters considered, and the photometric accuracy. Special attention is paid to the results expected from real data.},

  abstract = {We describe a new program for determining photometric redshifts, dubbed EAZY. The program is optimized for cases where spectroscopic redshifts are not available, or are only available for a biased subset of the galaxies. The code combines features from various existing codes: it can fit linear combinations of templates, it includes optional flux- and redshift-based priors, and its user interface is modeled on the popular HYPERZ code. A novel feature is that the default template set, as well as the default functional forms of the priors, are not based on (usually highly biased) spectroscopic samples, but on semianalytical models. Furthermore, template mismatch is addressed by a novel rest-frame template error function. This function gives different wavelength regions different weights, and ensures that the formal redshift uncertainties are realistic. We introduce a redshift quality parameter, Q z , which provides a robust estimate of the reliability of the photometric redshift estimate. Despite the fact that EAZY is not "trained" on spectroscopic samples, the code (with default parameters) performs very well on existing public data sets. For K -selected samples in CDF-South and other deep fields, we find a 1 σ scatter in Δ z/(1 + z) of 0.034, and we provide updated photometric redshift catalogs for the FIRES, MUSYC, and FIREWORKS surveys.},

  abstract = {The ALESS survey has followed up on a sample of 122 sub-millimeter sources in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South at 870 μ m with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), allowing us to pinpoint the positions of sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs) to ∼0.3 arcsec and to find their precise counterparts at different wavelengths. This enabled the first compilation of the multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of a statistically reliable survey of SMGs. In this paper, we present a new calibration of the magphys SED modeling code that is optimized to fit these ultraviolet-to-radio SEDs of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn1.gif] {$z\gt 1$} star-forming galaxies using an energy balance technique to connect the emission from stellar populations, dust attenuation, and dust emission in a physically consistent way. We derive statistically and physically robust estimates of the photometric redshifts and physical parameters (such as stellar masses, dust attenuation, star formation rates (SFRs), and dust masses) for the ALESS SMGs. We find that the ALESS SMGs have median stellar mass ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn2.gif] {${M}_{*}=8.9\pm 0.1\times {10}^{10}\;{M}_{\odot }$} , median SFR ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn3.gif] {$=\;280\pm 70\;{M}_{\odot }\;{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$} , median overall V -band dust attenuation ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn4.gif] {${A}_{V}=1.9\pm 0.2$} mag, median dust mass ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn5.gif] {${M}_{\mathrm{dust}}=(5.6\pm 1.0)\times {10}^{8}\;{M}_{\odot }$} , and median average dust temperature ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn6.gif] {${T}_{\mathrm{dust}}\simeq 40$} K. We find that the average intrinsic SED of the ALESS SMGs resembles that of local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies in the infrared range, but the stellar emission of our average SMG is brighter and bluer, indicating lower dust attenuation, possibly because they are more extended. We explore how the average SEDs vary with different parameters (redshift, sub-millimeter flux, dust attenuation, and total infrared luminosity), and we provide a new set of SMG templates that can be used to interpret other SMG observations. To put the ALESS SMGs into context, we compare their stellar masses and SFRs with those of less actively star-forming galaxies at the same redshifts. We find that at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn7.gif] {$z\simeq 2$} , about half of the SMGs lie above the star-forming main sequence (with SFRs three times larger than normal galaxies of the same stellar mass), while half are consistent with being at the high-mass end of the main sequence. At higher redshifts ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn8.gif] {$z\simeq 3.5$} ), the SMGs tend to have higher SFRs and stellar masses, but the fraction of SMGs that lie significantly above the main sequence decreases to less than a third.},

  abstract = {Several recent studies have shown that about half of the massive galaxies at z ~ 2 are in a quiescent phase. Moreover, these galaxies are commonly found to be ultra-compact with half-light radii of ~1 kpc. We have obtained a ~29 hr spectrum of a typical quiescent, ultra-dense galaxy at z = 2.1865 with the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph. The spectrum exhibits a strong optical break and several absorption features, which have not previously been detected in z > 2 quiescent galaxies. Comparison of the spectral energy distribution with stellar population synthesis models implies a low star formation rate (SFR) of 1-3 M ☉ yr –1 , an age of 1.3-2.2 Gyr, and a stellar mass of ~2 × 10 11 M ☉ . We detect several faint emission lines, with emission-line ratios of[N II ]/Hα, [S II ]/Hα, and[O II]/[O III ] typical of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions. Thus, neither the stellar continuum nor the nebular emission implies active star formation. The current SFR is <1% of the past average SFR. If this galaxy is representative of compact quiescent galaxies beyond z = 2, it implies that quenching of star formation is extremely efficient and also indicates that low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) could be common in these objects. Nuclear emission is a potential concern for the size measurement. However, we show that the AGN contributes ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 8% to the rest-frame optical emission. A possible post-starburst population may affect size measurements more strongly; although a 0.5 Gyr old stellar population can make up ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 10% of the total stellar mass, it could account for up to ~40% of the optical light. Nevertheless, this spectrum shows that this compact galaxy is dominated by an evolved stellar population.},

  abstract = {We present a two-dimensional fitting algorithm (GALFIT) designed to extract structural components from galaxy images, with emphasis on closely modeling light profiles of spatially well-resolved, nearby galaxies observed with the Hubble Space Telescope . Our algorithm improves on previous techniques in two areas: by being able to simultaneously fit a galaxy with an arbitrary number of components and with optimization in computation speed, suited for working on large galaxy images. We use two-dimensional models such as the "Nuker" law, the Sérsic (de Vaucouleurs) profile, an exponential disk, and Gaussian or Moffat functions. The azimuthal shapes are generalized ellipses that can fit disky and boxy components. Some potential applications of our program include: standard modeling of global galaxy profiles; extracting bars, stellar disks, double nuclei, and compact nuclear sources; and measuring absolute dust extinction or surface brightness fluctuations after removing the galaxy model. When examined in detail, we find that even simple looking galaxies generally require at least three components to be modeled accurately, rather than the one or two components more often employed. Many galaxies with complex isophotes, ellipticity changes, and position angle twists can be modeled accurately in two dimensions. We illustrate this by way of 11 case studies, which include regular and barred spiral galaxies, highly disky lenticular galaxies, and elliptical galaxies displaying various levels of complexities. A useful extension of this algorithm is to accurately extract nuclear point sources in galaxies. We compare two-dimensional and one-dimensional extraction techniques on simulated images of galaxies having nuclear slopes with different degrees of cuspiness, and we then illustrate the application of the program to several examples of nearby galaxies with weak nuclei.},

Our technique improves on previous 2D fitting algorithms by allowing for irregular, curved, logarithmic and power-law spirals, ring, and truncated shapes in otherwise traditional parametric functions like the Sérsic, Moffat, King, Ferrer, etc., profiles. One can mix and match these new shape features freely, with or without constraints, and apply them to an arbitrary number of model components of numerous profile types, so as to produce realistic-looking galaxy model images. Yet, despite the potential for extreme complexity, the meaning of the key parameters like the Sérsic index, effective radius, or luminosity remains intuitive and essentially unchanged. The new features have an interesting potential for use to quantify the degree of asymmetry of galaxies, to quantify low surface brightness tidal features beneath and beyond luminous galaxies, to allow more realistic decompositions of galaxy subcomponents in the presence of strong rings and spiral arms, and to enable ways to gauge the uncertainties when decomposing galaxy subcomponents.

To get as much information as possible from dust emissions, we have developed a tool, named as $COREGA$, which is capable of identifying positions of dense cores, optimizing a three-dimensional model for the dense cores with well characterized uncertainties. $COREGA$ can also estimate the physical properties of dense cores, such as density, temperature, and dust emissivity, through analyzing multi-wavelength dust continuum data sets. In the numerical tests on $COREGA$, the results of fitting simulated data are consistent with initial built-in parameters. We also demonstrate $COREGA$ by adding random gaussian noises with Monte Carlo methods and show that the results are stable against varying observational noise intensities within certain levels. A beam size $<$ 3 arcsec and rms $<$ 0.2mJy/pixel (1 pixel = 0.1") is needed for ALMA to distinguish different collapse models, such as power law and Bonner-Ebert sphere, during continuum observations of massive dense cores in Orion molecular cloud.

The galaxies are drawn from the SINGS sample and cover a range of morphologies and a factor \~{}10 in oxygen abundance. Published data on local low-metallicity starburst galaxies and LIRGs are also included in the analysis. Both the stellar continuum-subtracted 8 {$\mu$}m emission and the 24 {$\mu$}m emission correlate with the extinction-corrected Pa{$\alpha$} line emission, although neither relationship is linear. Simple models of stellar populations and dust extinction and emission are able to reproduce the observed nonlinear trend of the 24 {$\mu$}m emission versus number of ionizing photons, including the modest deficiency of 24 {$\mu$}m emission in the low-metallicity regions, which results from a combination of decreasing dust opacity and dust temperature at low luminosities. Conversely, the trend of the 8 {$\mu$}m emission as a function of the number of ionizing photons is not well reproduced by the same models. The 8 {$\mu$}m emission is contributed, in larger measure than the 24 {$\mu$}m emission, by dust heated by nonionizing stellar populations, in addition to the ionizing ones, in agreement with previous findings. Two SFR calibrations, one using the 24 {$\mu$}m emission and the other using a combination of the 24 {$\mu$}m and H{$\alpha$} luminosities (Kennicutt and coworkers), are presented. No calibration is presented for the 8 {$\mu$}m emission because of its significant dependence on both metallicity and environment. The calibrations presented here should be directly applicable to systems dominated by ongoing star formation.

  abstract = {Petrosian magnitudes were designed to help with the difficult task of determining a galaxy's total light. Although these magnitudes [taken here as the flux within 2 R P , with the inverted Petrosian index 1/η( R P ) = 0.2] can represent most of an object's flux, they do of course miss the light outside the Petrosian aperture (2 R P ). The size of this flux deficit varies monotonically with the shape of a galaxy's light profile, i.e., its concentration. In the case of a de Vaucouleurs R 1/4 profile, the deficit is 0.20 mag; for an R 1/8 profile this figure rises to 0.50 mag. Here we provide a simple method for recovering total (Sérsic) magnitudes from Petrosian magnitudes using only the galaxy concentration ( R 90 / R 50 or R 80 / R 20 ) within the Petrosian aperture. The corrections hold to the extent that Sérsic's model provides a good description of a galaxy's luminosity profile. We show how the concentration can also be used to convert Petrosian radii into effective half-light radii, enabling a robust measure of the mean effective surface brightness. Our technique is applied to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 2 (SDSS DR2) Petrosian parameters, yielding good agreement with the total magnitudes, effective radii, and mean effective surface brightnesses obtained from the New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog Sérsic R 1/ n fits by Blanton and coworkers. Although the corrective procedure described here is specifically applicable to the SDSS DR2 and DR3, it is generally applicable to all imaging data where any Petrosian index and concentration can be constructed.},

We also revisit multi-wavelength counterparts for published X-ray sources from the 4 Ms CDFS and 250 ks ECDFS surveys, finding reliable counterparts for 1207 out of 1259 sources (\~{}96\%). Data used for photometric redshifts include intermediate-band photometry deblended using the TFIT method, which is used for the first time in this work. Photometric redshifts for X-ray source counterparts are based on a new library of active galactic nuclei/galaxy hybrid templates appropriate for the faint X-ray population in the CDFS. Photometric redshift accuracy for normal galaxies is 0.010 and for X-ray sources is 0.014 and outlier fractions are 4\% and 5.2\%, respectively. The results within the CANDELS coverage area are even better, as demonstrated both by spectroscopic comparison and by galaxy-pair statistics. Intermediate-band photometry, even if shallow, is valuable when combined with deep broadband photometry. For best accuracy, templates must include emission lines.},

Using extinction-corrected H{$\alpha$} luminosities and total infrared luminosities as reference SFR estimates, we calibrate WISE mid-infrared- (MIR-) related SFR indicators. Both the 12 and 22 {$\mu$}m monochromatic luminosities correlate well with the reference the SFR estimates, but tend to underestimate the SFRs of metal-poor galaxies (at lower than solar metallicity), consistent with previous studies. We mitigate this metallicity dependence by using a linear combination of observed H{$\alpha$} and WISE MIR luminosities for our SFR estimates. This combination provides SFR measurements as robust as those applied to Spitzer data by Kennicutt et al. However, we find that the coefficient a in L $_{Hα(obs)}$ + aL $_{MIR}$ increases with the SFR, and show that a nonlinear combination of observed H{$\alpha$} and MIR luminosities gives the best SFR estimates with small scatters and with little dependence on physical parameters. Such a combination of H{$\alpha$} and MIR luminosities for SFR estimates is first applied to the WISE data. Using WISE data, we provide several SFR recipes that are applicable to galaxies with 0.1 lsim SFR (M $_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$) lsim 100.},

J-PLUS is a multi narrow-band filter survey carried out with the 2 deg2 field of view T80Cam camera, mounted on the JAST/T80 telescope in the OAJ, Teruel, Spain. The information of the twelve J-PLUS bands, including the J0660 narrow-band filter located at rest-frame Halpha, is used over 42 deg2 to extract de-reddened and [NII] decontaminated Halpha emission line fluxes of 46 star-forming regions with previous SDSS and/or CALIFA spectroscopic information. The agreement of the inferred J-PLUS photometric Halpha fluxes and those obtained with spectroscopic data is remarkable, with a median comparison ratio R = 1.05 +- 0.25. This demonstrates that it is possible to retrieve reliable Halpha emission line fluxes from J-PLUS photometric data. With an expected area of thousands of square degrees upon completion, the J-PLUS dataset will allow the study of several star formation science cases in the nearby universe, as the spatially resolved star formation rate of nearby galaxies at z < 0.015, and how it is influenced by the environment, morphology or nuclear activity. As an illustrative example, the close pair of interacting galaxies NGC3994 and NGC3995 is analyzed, finding an enhancement of the star formation rate not only in the center, but also in outer parts of the disk of NGC3994.},

  abstract = {This is the second paper in a series aimed at investigating the main sources of uncertainty in measuring the observable parameters in galaxies from their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). In the first paper we presented a detailed account of the photometric redshift measurements and an error analysis of this process. In this paper we perform a comprehensive study of the main sources of random and systematic error in stellar mass estimates for galaxies, and their relative contributions to the associated error budget. Since there is no prior knowledge of the stellar mass of galaxies (unlike their photometric redshifts), we use mock galaxy catalogs with simulated multi-waveband photometry and known redshift, stellar mass, age and extinction for individual galaxies. The multi-waveband photometry for the simulated galaxies were generated in 13 filters spanning from U -band to mid-infrared wavelengths. Given different parameters affecting stellar mass measurement (photometric signal-to-noise ratios (S/N), SED fitting errors and systematic effects), the inherent degeneracies and correlated errors, we formulated different simulated galaxy catalogs to quantify these effects individually. For comparison, we also generated catalogs based on observed photometric data of real galaxies in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-South field, spanning the same passbands. The simulated and observed catalogs were provided to a number of teams within the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey collaboration to estimate the stellar masses for individual galaxies. A total of 11 teams participated, with different combinations of stellar mass measurement codes/methods, population synthesis models, star formation histories, extinction and age. For each simulated galaxy, the differences between the input stellar masses, M input , and those estimated by each team, M est , is defined as ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/808/1/101/apj515559ieqn1.gif] {${\rm{\Delta }}\mathrm{log}(M)\equiv \mathrm{log}({M}_{\mathrm{estimated}})-\mathrm{log}({M}_{\mathrm{input}})$} , and used to identify the most fundamental parameters affecting stellar mass estimate in galaxies, with the following results. (1) No significant bias in Δ log( M ) was found among different codes, with all having comparable scatter ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/808/1/101/apj515559ieqn2.gif] {$\sigma ({\rm{\Delta }}\mathrm{log}(M))=0.136$} dex). The estimated stellar mass values are seriously affected by low photometric S/N, with the rms scatter increasing for galaxies with ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/808/1/101/apj515559ieqn3.gif] {${H}_{\mathrm{AB}}\gt 26$} mag; (2) A source of error contributing to the scatter in Δ log( M ) is found to be due to photometric uncertainties (0.136 dex) and low resolution in age and extinction grids when generating the SED templates; (3) The median of stellar masses among different methods provides a stable measure of the mass associated with any given galaxy ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/808/1/101/apj515559ieqn4.gif] {$\sigma ({\rm{\Delta }}\mathrm{log}(M))=0.142$} dex); (4) The Δ log( M ) values are strongly correlated with deviations in age (defined as the difference between the estimated and expected values), with a weaker correlation with extinction; (5) The rms scatter in the estimated stellar masses due to free parameters (after fixing redshifts and initial mass function) are quantified and found to be ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/808/1/101/apj515559ieqn5.gif] {$\sigma ({\rm{\Delta }}\mathrm{log}(M))=0.110$} dex; (6) Using the observed data, we studied the sensitivity of stellar masses to both the population synthesis codes and inclusion of nebular emission lines and found them to affect the stellar mass by 0.2 and 0.3 dex respectively.},

Morphologies are estimated with Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). The median redshift of the sample is $\ltz\gt\sim1.25$. The algorithm is trained on GOODS-S for which visual classifications are publicly available and then applied to the other 4 fields. Following the CANDELS main morphology classification scheme, our model retrieves the probabilities for each galaxy of having a spheroid, a disk, presenting an irregularity, being compact or point source and being unclassifiable. ConvNets are able to predict the fractions of votes given a galaxy image with zero bias and $\sim10\\%$ scatter. The fraction of miss-classifications is less than $1\\%$. Our classification scheme represents a major improvement with respect to CAS (Concentration-Asymmetry-Smoothness)-based methods, which hit a $20-30\\%$ contamination limit at high z.

  title       = {Leaves on trees: identifying halo stars with extreme gradient boosted trees},
  abstract    = {Extended stellar haloes are a natural by-product of the hierarchical formation of massive galaxies. If merging is a non-negligible factor in the growth of our Galaxy, evidence of such events should be encoded in its stellar halo. Reliable identification of genuine halo stars is a challenging task however. The 1st Gaia data release contains the positions, parallaxes and proper motions for over 2 million stars, mostly in the Solar neighbourhood. Gaia DR2 will enlarge this sample to over 1.5 billion stars, the brightest ~5 million of which will have a full phase-space information. Our aim is to develop a machine learning model to reliably identify halo stars, even when their full phase-space information is not available. We use the Gradient Boosted Trees algorithm to build a supervised halo star classifier. The classifier is trained on a sample extracted from the Gaia Universe Model Snapshot, convolved with the errors of TGAS, as well as with the expected uncertainties of the upcoming Gaia DR2. We also trained our classifier on the cross-match between the TGAS and RAVE catalogues, where the halo stars are labelled in an entirely model independent way. We then use this model to identify halo stars in TGAS. When full phase- space information is available and for Gaia DR2-like uncertainties, our classifier is able to recover 90% of the halo stars with at most 30% distance errors, in a completely unseen test set, and with negligible levels of contamination. When line-of-sight velocity is not available, we recover ~60% of such halo stars, with less than 10% contamination. When applied to the TGAS data, our classifier detects 337 high confidence RGB halo stars. Although small, this number is consistent with the expectation from models given the data uncertainties. The large parallax errors are the biggest limitation to identify a larger number of halo stars in all the cases studied.},

  abstract = {We present a new model for computing the effects of dust on the integrated spectral properties of galaxies, based on an idealized description of the main features of the interstellar medium (ISM). The model includes the ionization of H II regions in the interiors of the dense clouds in which stars form and the influence of the finite lifetime of these clouds on the absorption of radiation. We compute the production of emission lines and the absorption of continuum radiation in the H II regions and the subsequent transfer of line and continuum radiation in the surrounding H I regions and the ambient ISM. This enables us to interpret simultaneously all the observations of an ultraviolet-selected sample of nearby starburst galaxies, including the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities, the ratio of Hα to Hβ luminosities, the Hα equivalent width, and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We show that the finite lifetime of stellar birth clouds is a key ingredient for resolving an apparent discrepancy between the attenuation of line and continuum photons in starburst galaxies. In addition, we find that an effective absorption curve proportional to λ -0.7 reproduces the observed relation between the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We interpret this relation most simply as a sequence in the overall dust content of the galaxies. The shallow wavelength dependence of the effective absorption curve is compatible with the steepness of known extinction curves if the dust has a patchy distribution. In particular, we find that a random distribution of discrete clouds with optical depths similar to those in the Milky Way provides a consistent interpretation of all the observations. A noteworthy outcome of our detailed analysis is that the observed mean relations for starburst galaxies can be closely approximated by the following simple recipe: use an effective absorption curve proportional to λ -0.7 to attenuate the line and continuum radiation from each stellar generation, and lower the normalization of the curve, typically by a factor of 3 after 10 7 yr, to account for the dispersal of the birth clouds. This recipe or our full model for absorption can be incorporated easily into any population synthesis model.},

  abstract    = {We use machine learning to identify in color images of high-redshift galaxies an astrophysical phenomenon predicted by cosmological simulations. This phenomenon, called the blue nugget (BN) phase, is the compact star-forming phase in the central regions of many growing galaxies that follows an earlier phase of gas compaction and is followed by a central quenching phase. We train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with mock "observed" images of simulated galaxies at three phases of evolution: pre-BN, BN and post-BN, and demonstrate that the CNN successfully retrieves the three phases in other simulated galaxies. We show that BNs are identified by the CNN within a time window of $\sim0.15$ Hubble times. When the trained CNN is applied to observed galaxies from the CANDELS survey at $z=1-3$, it successfully identifies galaxies at the three phases. We find that the observed BNs are preferentially found in galaxies at a characteristic stellar mass range, $10^{9.2-10.3} M_\odot$ at all redshifts. This is consistent with the characteristic galaxy mass for BNs as detected in the simulations, and is meaningful because it is revealed in the observations when the direct information concerning the total galaxy luminosity has been eliminated from the training set. This technique can be applied to the classification of other astrophysical phenomena for improved comparison of theory and observations in the era of large imaging surveys and cosmological simulations.},

  abstract = {We present a catalog of visual-like H-band morphologies of ∼50.000 galaxies ( H f 160 w < 24.5) in the 5 CANDELS fields (GOODS-N, GOODS-S, UDS, EGS, and COSMOS). Morphologies are estimated using Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). The median redshift of the sample is ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0067-0049/221/1/8/apjs520039ieqn1.gif] {$\langle z\rangle \sim 1.25.$} The algorithm is trained on GOODS-S, for which visual classifications are publicly available, and then applied to the other 4 fields. Following the CANDELS main morphology classification scheme, our model retrieves for each galaxy the probabilities of having a spheroid or a disk, presenting an irregularity, being compact or a point source, and being unclassifiable. ConvNets are able to predict the fractions of votes given to a galaxy image with zero bias and ∼10% scatter. The fraction of mis-classifications is less than 1%. Our classification scheme represents a major improvement with respect to Concentration-Asymmetry-Smoothness-based methods, which hit a 20%–30% contamination limit at high z . The catalog is released with the present paper via the Rainbow database ( http://rainbowx.fis.ucm.es/Rainbow_navigator_public/ [http://rainbowx.fis.ucm.es/Rainbow_navigator_public/] ).},

  abstract      = {Understanding how bulges grow in galaxies is critical step towards unveiling the link between galaxy morphology and star-formation. To do so, it is necessary to decompose large sample of galaxies at different epochs into their main components (bulges and disks). This is particularly challenging, especially at high redshifts, where galaxies are poorly resolved. This work presents a catalog of bulge-disk decompositions of the surface brightness profiles of \~{}17.600 H-band selected galaxies in the CANDELS fields (F160W$\lt$23, 0$\lt$z$\lt$2) in 4 to 7 filters covering a spectral range of 430-1600nm. This is the largest available catalog of this kind up to z = 2. By using a novel approach based on deep-learning to select the best model to fit, we manage to control systematics arising from wrong model selection and obtain less contaminated samples than previous works. We show that the derived structural properties are within $\sim10-20\\%$ of random uncertainties. We then fit stellar population models to the decomposed SEDs (Spectral Energy Distribution) of bulges and disks and derive stellar masses (and stellar mass bulge-to-total ratios) as well as rest-frame colors (U,V,J) for bulges and disks separately. All data products are publicly released with this paper and through the web page https://lerma.obspm.fr/huertas/form\_CANDELS and will be used for scientific analysis in forthcoming works.},

  month         = feb,
  abstract      = {Large scale imaging surveys will increase the number of galaxy-scale strong lensing candidates by maybe three orders of magnitudes beyond the number known today. Finding these rare objects will require picking them out of at least tens of millions of images and deriving scientific results from them will require quantifying the efficiency and bias of any search method. To achieve these objectives automated methods must be developed. Because gravitational lenses are rare objects reducing false positives will be particularly important. We present a description and results of an open gravitational lens finding challenge. Participants were asked to classify 100,000 candidate objects as to whether they were gravitational lenses or not with the goal of developing better automated methods for finding lenses in large data sets. A variety of methods were used including visual inspection, arc and ring finders, support vector machines (SVM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). We find that many of the methods will be easily fast enough to analyse the anticipated data flow. In test data, several methods are able to identify upwards of half the lenses after applying some thresholds on the lens characteristics such as lensed image brightness, size or contrast with the lens galaxy without making a single false-positive identification. This is significantly better than direct inspection by humans was able to do. (abridged)},

We also provide an additional probability enabling a separation between pure elliptical (E) from S0, where the T-Type model is not so efficient. For the T-Type, our results show smaller offset and scatter than previous models trained with support vector machines. For the GZ2 type questions, our models have large accuracy ($\gt$ 97$\backslash$\%), precision and recall values ($\gt$ 90$\backslash$\%) when applied to a test sample with the same characteristics as the one used for training.

We use the axioms to guide the design of a new attribution method called Integrated Gradients. Our method requires no modification to the original network and is extremely simple to implement; it just needs a few calls to the standard gradient operator. We apply this method to a couple of image models, a couple of text models and a chemistry model, demonstrating its ability to debug networks, to extract rules from a network, and to enable users to engage with models better.},

  abstract      = {The windows of low extinction in the Milky Way (MW) plane are rare but important because they enable us to place structural constraints on the opposite side of the Galaxy, which has hitherto been done rarely. We use the near-infrared (near-IR) images of the VISTA Variables in the V$\backslash$'ia L$\backslash$'actea (VVV) Survey to build extinction maps and to identify low extinction windows towards the Southern Galactic plane. Here we report the discovery of VVV WIN 1713$-$3939, a very interesting window with relatively uniform and low extinction conveniently placed very close to the Galactic plane. The new window of roughly 30 arcmin diameter is located at Galactic coordinates (l,b)= (347.4,-0.4) deg. We analyse the VVV near-IR colour-magnitude diagrams in this window. The mean total near-IR extinction and reddening values measured for this window are A\_Ks=0.46 and E(J-Ks)=0.95. The red clump giants within the window show a bimodal magnitude distribution in the Ks band, with peaks at Ks=14.1 and 14.8 mag, corresponding to mean distances of D=11.0+/-2.4 and 14.8+/-3.6 kpc, respectively. We discuss the origin of these red clump overdensities within the context of the MW disk structure.},

  title        = {Two-dimensional multi-component photometric decomposition of CALIFA galaxies},
  abstract     = {We present a two-dimensional multi-component photometric decomposition of 404 galaxies from the CALIFA Data Release 3. They represent all possible galaxies with no clear signs of interaction and not strongly inclined in the final CALIFA data release. Galaxies are modelled in the g, r, and i SDSS images including, when appropriate, a nuclear point source, bulge, bar, and an exponential or broken disc component. We use a human-supervised approach to determine the optimal number of structures to be included in the fit. The dataset, including the photometric parameters of the CALIFA sample, is released together with statistical errors and a visual analysis of the quality of each fit. The analysis of the photometric components reveals a clear segregation of the structural composition of galaxies with stellar mass. At high masses (log(Mstar/Msun)>11), the galaxy population is dominated by galaxies modelled with a single Sersic or a bulge+disc with a bulge-to-total (B/T) luminosity ratio B/T>0.2. At intermediate masses (9.5<log(Mstar/Msun)<11), galaxies described with bulge+disc but B/T < 0.2 are preponderant, whereas, at the low mass end (log(Mstar/Msun)<9.5), the prevailing population is constituted by galaxies modelled with either pure discs or nuclear point sources+discs (i.e., no discernible bulge). We obtain that 57% of the volume corrected sample of disc galaxies in the CALIFA sample host a bar. This bar fraction shows a significant drop with increasing galaxy mass in the range 9.5<log(Mstar/Msun)<11.5. The analyses of the extended multi-component radial profile result in a volume-corrected distribution of 62%, 28%, and 10% for the so-called Type I, Type II, and Type III disc profiles, respectively. These fractions are in discordance with previous findings. We argue that the different methodologies used to detect the breaks are the main cause for these differences.},

  abstract    = {We present a new framework (MADE) that produces distance and age estimates by applying a Bayesian isochrone pipeline to a combination of photometric, astrometric and spectroscopic data. For giant stars, the framework can supplement these observational constraints with posterior predictive distributions for mass from a new Bayesian spectroscopic mass estimator. The new mass estimator is a Bayesian artificial neural network (ANN) that learns the relationship between a specified set of inputs and outputs based on a training set. Posterior predictive distributions for the outputs given new inputs are computed, taking into account input uncertainties, and uncertainties in the parameters of the ANN. MADE trains the ANN on stars with spectroscopic and asteroseismology data to enable posterior predictive distributions for present masses of giant stars to be evaluated given spectroscopic data. We apply MADE to $\sim10\,000$ red giants in the overlap between APO Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) and the Tycho-Gaia astrometric solution (TGAS). The ANN is trained on a subsample of these stars with new asteroseismology determinations of mass, and is able to predict the masses to a similar degree of uncertainty as the measurement uncertainty. In particular, it is able to reduce the uncertainty on those with the highest measurement uncertainty. Using these masses in the Bayesian isochrone pipeline along with photometric and astrometric data, we are able to obtain distance estimates with uncertainties of order $\sim 10\%$ and age estimates with uncertainties of order $\sim 20\%$. Our resulting catalogue clearly demonstrates the expected thick and thin disc components in the [M/H]-[$\alpha$/M] plane when examined by age.},

These composite SEDs were previously constructed from the photometric catalogs of the NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey by stacking the observed photometry of galaxies that have similar rest-frame NUV-to-NIR SEDs. In this work, we include a stacked MIPS 24 {$\mu$}m measurement for each SED type to extend the SEDs to rest-frame MIR wavelengths. Consistent with previous studies, the observed MIR emission for most SED types is higher than expected from only the attenuated stellar emission. We fit the NUV-to-MIR composite SEDs with the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis (FSPS) models, which include both stellar and dust emission. We compare the best-fit star formation rates (SFRs) to the SFRs based on simple UV+IR estimators. Interestingly, the UV and IR luminosities overestimate SFRs{\mdash}compared to the model SFRs{\mdash}by more than \~{}1 dex for quiescent galaxies, while for the highest star-forming galaxies in our sample the two SFRs are broadly consistent. The difference in specific SFRs also shows a gradually increasing trend with declining specific SFR, implying that quiescent galaxies have even lower specific SFRs than previously found. Contributions from evolved stellar populations to both the UV and the MIR SEDs most likely explain the discrepancy. Based on this work, we conclude that SFRs should be determined from modeling the attenuated stellar and dust emission simultaneously, instead of employing simple UV+IR-based SFR estimators.},

  abstract      = {To automate source detection, two-dimensional light profile S{\'e}rsic modelling and catalogue compilation in large survey applications, we introduce a new code Galaxy Analysis over Large Areas: Parameter Assessment by GALFITting Objects from SEXTRACTOR (GALAPAGOS). Based on a single set-up, GALAPAGOS can process a complete set of survey images. It detects sources in the data, estimates a local sky background, cuts postage stamp images for all sources, prepares object masks, performs S{\'e}rsic fitting including neighbours and compiles all objects in a final output catalogue. For the initial source detection, GALAPAGOS applies SEXTRACTOR, while GALFIT is incorporated for modelling S{\'e}rsic profiles. It measures the background sky involved in the S{\'e}rsic fitting by means of a flux growth curve. GALAPAGOS determines postage stamp sizes based on SEXTRACTOR shape parameters. In order to obtain precise model parameters, GALAPAGOS incorporates a complex sorting mechanism and makes use of modern CPU's multiplexing capabilities. It combines SEXTRACTOR and GALFIT data in a single output table. When incorporating information from overlapping tiles, GALAPAGOS automatically removes multiple entries from identical sources. GALAPAGOS is programmed in the Interactive Data Language (IDL). We test the stability and the ability to properly recover structural parameters extensively with artificial image simulations. Moreover, we apply GALAPAGOS successfully to the STAGES data set. For one-orbit Hubble Space Telescope data, a single 2.2-GHz CPU processes about 1000 primary sources per 24 h. Note that GALAPAGOS results depend critically on the user-defined parameter set-up. This paper provides useful guidelines to help the user make sensible choices.},

The source was pre-selected photometrically in the EGS field as a robust z {\tilde} 8 candidate with H = 25.0 mag based on optical non-detections and a very red Spitzer/IRAC [3.6]-[4.5] broad-band color driven by high equivalent width [O iii]+H{$\beta$} line emission. The Ly{$\alpha$} line is reliably detected at 6.1{$\sigma$}  and shows an asymmetric profile as expected for a galaxy embedded in a relatively neutral intergalactic medium near the Planck peak of cosmic reionization. The line has a rest-frame equivalent width of E$\{$$\{$W$\}$$_{0}$$\}$=21+/- 4 {\AA} and is extended with $\{$$\{$V$\}$$_{FWHM}$$\}$=360$_{-70}$$^{+90}$ km s$^{-1}$. The source is perhaps the brightest and most massive z {\tilde} 8 Lyman break galaxy in the full CANDELS and BoRG/HIPPIES surveys, having already assembled $\{$$\{$10$\}$$^{9.9+/- 0.2}$$\}$ $\{$$\{$M$\}$$_{⊙ }$$\}$ of stars at only 650 Myr after the Big Bang. The spectroscopic redshift measurement sets a new redshift record for galaxies. This enables reliable constraints on the stellar mass, star formation rate, and formation epoch, as well as combined [O iii]+H{$\beta$} line equivalent widths. The redshift confirms that the IRAC [4.5] photometry is very likely dominated by line emission with EW$_{0}$([O iii]+H{$\beta$}) = 720$_{-150}$$^{+180}$ {\AA}. This detection thus adds to the evidence that extreme rest-frame optical emission lines are a ubiquitous feature of early galaxies promising very efficient spectroscopic follow-up in the future with infrared spectroscopy using the James Webb Space Telescope and, later, ELTs.},

Extensive simulations for a number of common situations realizable in small-to-large samples of cluster radial velocities allow the identification of minimum variance estimators. Also explored is the estimation of confidence intervals, using the jacknife and bootstrap resampling techniques. These methods are compared to simple formulas based on sample estimates of central location and scale. Estimators of confidence intervals on scale require resampling.},

  abstract    = {We present a new Galaxy population synthesis Model (GalMod). GalMod is a star-count model featuring an asymmetric bar/bulge as well as spiral arms and related extinction. The model, initially introduced in Pasetto et al. (2016b), has been here completed with a central bar, a new bulge description, new disk vertical profiles and several new bolometric corrections. The model can generate synthetic mock catalogs of visible portions of the Milky Way (MW), external galaxies like M31, or N-body simulation initial conditions. At any given time, e.g., a chosen age of the Galaxy, the model contains a sum of discrete stellar populations, namely bulge/bar, disk, halo. These populations are in turn the sum of different components: the disk is the sum of spiral arms, thin disks, a thick disk, and various gas components, while the halo is the sum of a stellar component, a hot coronal gas, and a dark matter component. The Galactic potential is computed from these population density profiles and used to generate detailed kinematics by considering up to the first four moments of the collisionless Boltzmann equation. The same density profiles are then used to define the observed color-magnitude diagrams in a user-defined field of view from an arbitrary solar location. Several photometric systems have been included and made available on-line and no limits on the size of the field of view are imposed thus allowing full sky simulations, too. Finally, we model the extinction adopting a dust model with advanced ray-tracing solutions. The model's web page (and tutorial) can be accessed at www.GalMod.org.},

  abstract      = {In large optical survey at high redshifts ($z\gt2$), the CIV broad emission line is the most practical alternative to estimate the mass ($M\_{\text{BH}}$) of active super-massive black holes (SMBHs). However, mass determinations obtained with this line are known to be highly uncertain. In this work we use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 and 12 quasar catalogues to statistically test three alternative methods put forward in the literature to improve CIV-based $M\_{\text{BH}}$ estimations. These methods are constructed from correlations between the ratio of the CIV line-width to the low ionization line-widths (H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and MgII) and several other properties of rest-frame UV emission lines. Our analysis suggests that these correction methods are of limited applicability, mostly because all of them depend on correlations that are driven by the linewidth of the CIV profile itself and not by an interconnection between the linewidth of the CIV line with the linewidth of the low ionization lines. Our results show that optical CIV-based mass estimates at high redshift cannot be a proper replacement for estimates based on IR spectroscopy of low ionization lines like H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and MgII},

  title       = {Predicting extragalactic distance errors using Bayesian inference in multi-measurement catalogs},
  abstract    = {We propose two methods for robustly estimating extragalactic distance errors in multi-measurement catalogs. We seek to improve upon more commonly used frequentist propagation-of-error methods, as they fail to explain both the scatter between different measurements and the effects of skewness in the metric distance probability distribution. For individual galaxies, the most transparent way to assess the variance of redshift independent distances is to directly sample the posterior probability distribution obtained from the mixture of reported measurements. However, sampling the posterior can be cumbersome for catalog-wide precision cosmology applications. We compare the performance of frequentist methods versus our proposed measures for estimating the true variance of the metric distance probability distribution. We provide pre-computed distance error data tables for galaxies in 3 catalogs: NED-D, HyperLEDA, and Cosmicflows-3. From a Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based analysis of systematic and random effects in the computed errors, we develop a predictive Bayesian model for the variance of distance errors for Tully-Fisher relation (TF) derived distances in NED-D. We validate this model with a Bayesian $p$-value computed using the Freeman-Tukey discrepancy measure as a posterior predictive check. We are then able to predict distance errors for 818 galaxies in the NED-D catalog which do not report TF distance modulus errors. Our goal is that our pre-computed errors are used in catalog-wide applications that require acknowledging the true variance of extragalactic distance measurements.},

We extensively validate the optimized code and compare its performance against empirical methods and other available emission line codes (PYQZ and HII-CHI-MISTRY) on a sample of 62 SDSS stacked galaxy spectra and 75 observed HII regions. Very good agreement is found for metallicity. However, ionization parameters derived by GAME tend to be higher. We show that this is due to the use of too limited libraries in the other codes. The main advantages of GAME are the simultaneous use of all the measured spectral lines, and the extremely short computational times. We finally discuss the code potential and limitations.},

  abstract    = {Using mock spectra based on Vazdekis/MILES library fitted within the wavelength region 3600-7350\AA, we analyze the bias and scatter on the resulting physical parameters induced by the choice of fitting algorithms and observational uncertainties, but avoid effects of those model uncertainties. We consider two full-spectrum fitting codes: pPXF and STARLIGHT, in fitting for stellar population age, metallicity, mass-to-light ratio, and dust extinction. With pPXF we find that both the bias in the population parameters and the scatter in the recovered logarithmic values follows the expected trend. The bias increases for younger ages and systematically makes recovered ages older, $M_*/L_r$ larger and metallicities lower than the true values. For reference, at S/N=30, and for the worst case ($t=10^8$yr), the bias is 0.06 dex in $M_*/L_r$, 0.03 dex in both age and [M/H]. There is no significant dependence on either E(B-V) or the shape of the error spectrum. Moreover, the results are consistent for both our 1-SSP and 2-SSP tests. With the STARLIGHT algorithm, we find trends similar to pPXF, when the input E(B-V)<0.2 mag. However, with larger input E(B-V), the biases of the output parameter do not converge to zero even at the highest S/N and are strongly affected by the shape of the error spectra. This effect is particularly dramatic for youngest age, for which all population parameters can be strongly different from the input values, with significantly underestimated dust extinction and [M/H], and larger ages and $M_*/L_r$. Results degrade when moving from our 1-SSP to the 2-SSP tests. The STARLIGHT convergence to the true values can be improved by increasing Markov Chains and annealing loops to the "slow mode". For the same input spectrum, pPXF is about two order of magnitudes faster than STARLIGHT's "default mode" and about three order of magnitude faster than STARLIGHT's "slow mode".},

We tuned the CNN model using a custom training set of DLAs injected into DLA-free quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), data release 5 (DR5). Testing on a held-back validation set demonstrates a high incidence of DLAs recovered by the algorithm (97.4 per cent as DLAs and 99 per cent as an H I absorber with N\_$\{$H I$\}$$\gt$ 10\^{}$\{$19.5$\}$ cm\^{}$\{$-2$\}$) and excellent estimates for z$_{abs}$ and N\_$\{$H I$\}$. Similar results are obtained against a human-generated survey of the SDSS DR5 data set. The algorithm yields a low incidence of false positives and negatives but is challenged by overlapping DLAs and/or very high N\_$\{$H I$\}$ systems. We have applied this CNN model to the quasar spectra of SDSS DR7 and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (data release 12) and provide catalogues of 4913 and 50 969 DLAs, respectively (including 1659 and 9230 high-confidence DLAs that were previously unpublished).

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.

  abstract = {The study of stellar populations in galaxies is entering a new era with the availability of large and high-quality data bases of both observed galactic spectra and state-of-the-art evolutionary synthesis models. In this paper we investigate the power of spectral synthesis as a means to estimate the physical properties of galaxies. Spectral synthesis is nothing more than the decomposition of an observed spectrum in terms of a superposition of a base of simple stellar populations of various ages and metallicities, producing as output the star formation and chemical histories of a galaxy, its extinction and velocity dispersion. Our implementation of this method uses the recent models of Bruzual {\amp} Charlot and observed spectra in the 3650-8000 {\AA} range. The reliability of this approach is studied by three different means: (1) simulations, (2) comparison with previous work based on a different technique, and (3) analysis of the consistency of results obtained for a sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).  We find that spectral synthesis provides reliable physical parameters as long as one does not attempt a very detailed description of the star formation and chemical histories. Robust and physically interesting parameters are obtained by combining the (individually uncertain) strengths of each simple stellar population in the base. In particular, we show that, besides providing excellent fits to observed galaxy spectra, this method is able to recover useful information on the distributions of stellar ages and, more importantly, stellar metallicities. Stellar masses, velocity dispersion and extinction are also found to be accurately retrieved for realistic signal-to-noise ratios.  We apply this synthesis method to a volume-limited sample of 50362 galaxies from the SDSS Data Release 2, producing a catalogue of stellar population properties. Emission lines are also studied, their measurement being performed after subtracting the computed starlight spectrum from the observed one. A comparison with recent estimates of both observed and physical properties of these galaxies obtained by other groups shows good qualitative and quantitative agreement, despite substantial differences in the methods of analysis. The confidence in the present method is further strengthened by several empirical and astrophysically reasonable correlations between synthesis results and independent quantities. For instance, we report the existence of strong correlations between stellar and nebular metallicities, stellar and nebular extinctions, mean stellar age and equivalent width of H{$\alpha$} and 4000-{\AA} break, and between stellar mass and velocity dispersion.},

The trained networks were used to classify the spectra of a sample of 142 galaxies with 0.5 < z < 1 and the results compared to classifications performed using K-means clustering, a supervised neural network, and chi-squared minimization. Spectra corresponding to quiescent galaxies were more likely to be classified similarly by all methods while starburst spectra showed more variability. Compared to classification using chi-squared minimization or the supervised neural network, the galaxies classed together by the self-organizing map had more similar spectra. The class ordering provided by the one-dimensional self-organizing maps corresponds to an ordering in physical properties, a potentially important feature for the exploration of large datasets.},

Our method is based on characterizing the SEDs of galaxies as a function of their L(TIR) surface density, which is motivated by the indications that the majority of IR luminous star-forming galaxies at 1 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3 have extended star-forming regions, in contrast to the strongly nuclear concentrated, merger-induced starbursts in local luminous and ultraluminous IR galaxies. We validate our procedure for estimating L(TIR) by comparing the resulting L(TIR) with those measured from far-IR observations, such as those from Herschel in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDFS) and Hubble Deep Field North (HDFN), as well as L(TIR) measured from stacked far-IR observations at redshift 0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2.8. Active galactic nuclei were excluded using X-ray and 3.6-8.0 {$\mu$}m observations, which are generally available in deep cosmological survey fields. The Gaussian fits to the distribution of the discrepancies between the L(TIR) measurements from single-band 24 {$\mu$}m and Herschel observations in the ECDFS and HDFN samples have {$\sigma$} $\lt$ 0.1 dex, with \~{}10\% of objects disagreeing by more than 0.2 dex. Since the 24 {$\mu$}m estimates are based on SEDs for extended galaxies, this agreement suggests that \~{}90\% of IR galaxies at high z are indeed much more physically extended than local counterparts of similar L(TIR), consistent with recent independent studies of the fractions of galaxies forming stars in the main-sequence and starburst modes, respectively. Because we have not introduced empirical corrections to enhance these estimates, in principle, our method should be applicable to lower luminosity galaxies. This will enable use of the 21 {$\mu$}m band of the Mid-Infrared Instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope to provide an extremely sensitive tracer of obscured SFR in individual star-forming galaxies across the peak of the cosmic star formation history.},

  abstract    = {The luminosity function is a fundamental observable for characterizing how galaxies form and evolve throughout the cosmic history. One key ingredient to derive this measurement from the number counts in a survey is the characterization of the completeness and redshift selection functions for the observations. In this paper we present GLACiAR, an open python tool available on GitHub to estimate the completeness and selection functions in galaxy surveys. The code is tailored for multiband imaging surveys aimed at searching for high-redshift galaxies through the Lyman Break technique, but it can be applied broadly. The code generates artificial galaxies that follow Sersic profiles with different indexes and with customizable size, redshift and spectral energy distribution properties, adds them to input images, and measures the recovery rate. To illustrate this new software tool, we apply it to quantify the completeness and redshift selection functions for J-dropouts sources (redshift z~10 galaxies) in the Hubble Space Telescope Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies Survey (BoRG). Our comparison with a previous completeness analysis on the same dataset shows overall agreement, but also highlights how different modelling assumptions for artificial sources can impact completeness estimates.},

  abstract      = {Various galaxy classification schemes have been developed so far to constrain the main physical processes regulating evolution of different galaxy types. In the era of a deluge of astrophysical information and recent progress in machine learning, a new approach to galaxy classification becomes imperative. We employ a Fisher Expectation-Maximization unsupervised algorithm working in a parameter space of 12 rest-frame magnitudes and spectroscopic redshift. The model (DBk) and the number of classes (12) were established based on the joint analysis of standard statistical criteria and confirmed by the analysis of the galaxy distribution with respect to a number of classes and their properties. This new approach allows us to classify galaxies based just on their redshifts and UV-NIR spectral energy distributions. The FEM unsupervised algorithm has automatically distinguished 12 classes: 11 classes of VIPERS galaxies and an additional class of broad-line AGNs. After a first broad division into blue, green and red categories we obtained a further sub-division into three red, three green, and five blue galaxy classes. The FEM classes follow the galaxy sequence from the earliest to the latest types that is reflected in their colours (which are constructed from rest-frame magnitudes used in classification procedure) but also their morphological, physical, and spectroscopic properties (not included in the classification scheme). We demonstrate that the members of each class share similar physical and spectral properties. In particular, we are able to find three different classes of red passive galaxy populations. Thus, we demonstrate the potential of an unsupervised approach to galaxy classification and we retrieve the complexity of galaxy populations at z\~{}0.7, a task that usual simpler colour-based approaches cannot fulfil.},

  abstract      = {Techniques to classify galaxies and estimate their properties based on the photometric observations solely will be necessary for future large cosmology missions, such as Euclid. However, the classification accuracy is always lower in photometric surveys and can be systematically biased with respect to classifications based upon spectroscopic data. Our aim is to test how precisely the detailed classification scheme introduced by Siudek et al. accepted for galaxies at z\~{}0.7 could be reproduced if only photometric data were available. We applied the FEM unsupervised clustering algorithm to 54,293 VIPERS galaxies. To construct the parameter space, we used reliable photometric redshifts and 12 rest frame magnitudes obtained by the SED-fitting with the photo-z scatter\~{}0.03, and the outlier rate\~{}2\%. Subsequently, we compared the results to the analogous classification based on spectroscopic redshifts and corresponding absolute magnitudes. The FEM algorithm divided the VIPERS data into four main groups: (1) red, (2) green, (3) blue, and (4) outliers. Each group was further divided into 3, 3, 4, and 2 subclasses, respectively. The accuracy of reproducing galaxy classes using spectroscopic data is high 92\%, 84\%, 96\% for red, green, and blue classes, respectively. Our method was able to efficiently separate outliers (stars and broad-line AGNs), but failed to distinguish a class of star-forming galaxies with redder r-K colours and higher SFR than remaining star-forming classes. The presented verification of the photometric classification demonstrates that large photometric samples can be used to distinguish different galaxy classes at z$\gt$0.5 with an accuracy provided so far only by spectroscopic data except for particular galaxy classes. Confirming the synergy between classifications based on spectroscopic and photometric data demonstrates the usefulness of our approach in future large surveys.},

From the fields of galaxy and AGN evolution to precision cosmology, the number of scientific projects relying on such distance measurements, called photometric redshifts, have exploded. The benefits of photometric redshifts is that all sources detected in photometric images can have some distance estimates relatively cheaply. The major drawback is that these cheap estimates have a low precision when compared with the resource-expensive spectroscopy. The methodology to estimate redshifts has been through several major revolutions throughout the last decades, triggered by increasingly more stringent requirements on the photometric redshift accuracy. Here, we review the various techniques to obtain photometric redshifts, from template-fitting to machine learning and hybrid systems. We also describe the state-of-the-art results on current extra-galactic samples and explain how survey strategy choices impact redshift accuracy. We close the review with a description of the photometric redshifts efforts planned for upcoming wide field surveys, which will collect data on billions of galaxies, aiming to solve the most exciting cosmological and astrophysical questions of today.},

  abstract      = {We present a novel and efficient method for fitting dynamical models of stellar kinematic data in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph). Our approach is based on Gaussian-process emulation (GPE), which is a sophisticated form of curve fitting that requires fewer training data than alternative methods. We use a set of validation tests and diagnostic criteria to assess the performance of the emulation procedure. We have implemented an algorithm in which both the GPE procedure and its validation are fully automated. Applying this method to synthetic data, with fewer than 100 model evaluations we are able to recover a robust confidence region for the three-dimensional parameter vector of a toy model of the phase-space distribution function of a dSph. Although the dynamical model presented in this paper is low-dimensional and static, we emphasize that the algorithm is applicable to any scheme that involves the evaluation of computationally expensive models. It therefore has the potential to render tractable previously intractable problems, for example, the modelling of individual dSphs using high-dimensional, time-dependent N-body simulations.},

With this, an increasing amount of time is being spent extracting one dimensional object spectra from large three dimensional datacubes. However, a great deal of information available within these datacubes is overlooked in favor of photometrically based spatial information. Here we present a novel, yet simple approach of optimal source identification, utilizing the wealth of information available within an IFU datacube, rather than relying on ancillary imaging. We show that we are able to obtain object spectra comparable or superior to manual extractions. Further, implementing our custom designed algorithms also improves the signal-to-noise of the extracted spectra and successfully deblends sources from nearby contaminants. This will be a critical tool for future IFU observations of blank and deep fields, especially over large areas where automation is necessary.

RadFil builds filament profiles by taking radial cuts across the spine of a filament, thereby preserving the radial structure of the filament across its entire length. Pre-existing spines can be inputted directly into RadFil, or can be computed using the FilFinder package as part of the RadFil workflow. We provide Gaussian and Plummer built-in fitting functions, in addition to a background subtraction estimator, which can be fit to the entire ensemble of radial cuts or an average radial profile for the filament. Users can tweak parameters like the radial cut sampling interval, the background subtraction estimation radii, and the Gaussian/Plummer fitting radii. As a result, RadFil can provide treatment of how the resulting filament properties rely on systematics in the building and fitting process. We walk through the typical RadFil workflow and compare our results to those from an independent radial density profile code obtained using the same data; we find that our results are entirely consistent. RadFil is open source and available on GitHub. We also provide a complete working tutorial of the code available as a Jupyter notebook which users can download and run themselves.},

In this framework, we use the concept of distribution function to define the CSP in terms of mass, metallicity, and phase-space in a suitable space of existence $\mathbb{E}$ of the CSP. We introduce the concept of foliation of $\mathbb{E}$ to describe formally any CSP as sum of disjointed Simple Stellar Populations (SSP), with the aim to offer a more general formal setting to cast the equations of stellar populations theory and stellar dynamics theory. In doing so, we allow the CSP to be object of dissipation processes thus developing its dynamics in a general non-Hamiltonian framework. Furthermore, we investigate the necessary and sufficient condition to realize a multiple CSP consistent with its mass-metallicity and phase-space distribution function over its temporal evolution, for a collisionless CSP.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are proven to perform fast classification and detection on natural images and have potential to infer astrophysical parameters on the exponentially increasing amount of sky survey imaging data. The inference pipeline can be trained either from real human-annotated data or simulated mock observations. Up to now star cluster analysis was based on integral or individual resolved stellar photometry. This limits the amount of information that can be extracted from cluster images. Aims. Develop a CNN based algorithm aimed to simultaneously derive ages, masses, and sizes of star clusters directly from multi-band images. Demonstrate CNN capabilities on low mass semi-resolved star clusters in a low signal-to-noise regime. Methods. A CNN was constructed based on the deep residual network (ResNet) architecture and trained on simulated images of star clusters with various ages, masses, and sizes. To provide realistic backgrounds, M31 star fields taken from the PHAT survey were added to the mock cluster images. Results. The proposed CNN was verified on mock images of artificial clusters and has demonstrated high precision and no significant bias for clusters of ages $\lesssim$3Gyr and masses between 250 and 4,000 ${\rm M_\odot}$. The pipeline is end-to-end starting from input images all the way to the inferred parameters, no hand-coded steps have to be performed - estimates of parameters are provided by the neural network in one inferential step from raw images.},

The sample comprises a mixed distribution of quiescent (19) and star-forming galaxies (33). Using the cumulative distribution of stellar ages by mass, we define a ``quenching timescale'' that is found to correlate with stellar mass. The other population parameters, aside from metallicity, do not show such a strong correlation, although all display the characteristic segregation between quiescent and star-forming populations. Radial colour gradients within each galaxy are also explored, finding a wider scatter in the star-forming subsample, but no conclusive trend with respect to the population parameters.

  abstract      = {We perform spatially resolved, pixel-by-pixel Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting on galaxies up to z {\tilde} 2.5 in the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (XDF). Comparing stellar mass estimates from spatially resolved and spatially unresolved photometry we find that unresolved masses can be systematically underestimated by factors of up to 5. The ratio of the unresolved to resolved mass measurement depends on the galaxy's specific star formation rate (sSFR): at low sSFRs the bias is small, but above sSFR {\tilde} 10$^{-9.5}$ yr$^{-1}$ the discrepancy increases rapidly such that galaxies with sSFRs {\tilde} 10$^{-8}$ yr$^{-1}$ have unresolved mass estimates of only one-half to one-fifth of the resolved value. This result indicates that stellar masses estimated from spatially unresolved data sets need to be systematically corrected, in some cases by large amounts, and we provide an analytic prescription for applying this correction. We show that correcting stellar mass measurements for this bias changes the normalization and slope of the star-forming main sequence and reduces its intrinsic width; most dramatically, correcting for the mass bias increases the stellar mass density of the Universe at high redshift and can resolve the long-standing discrepancy between the directly measured cosmic SFR density at z {\gsim} 1 and that inferred from stellar mass densities (`the missing mass problem').},

  abstract      = {The new generation of broad-band radio continuum surveys will provide large data sets with polarization information. New algorithms need to be developed to extract reliable catalogs of linearly polarized sources that can be used to characterize those sources and produce a dense rotation measure (RM) grid to probe magneto-ionized structures along the line of sight via Faraday rotation. The aim of the paper is to develop a computationally efficient and rigorously defined source-finding algorithm for linearly polarized sources. We used a calibrated data set from the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) at 150 MHz centered on the nearby galaxy M51 to search for polarized background sources. With a new imaging software, we re-imaged the field at a resolution of 18''x15'' and cataloged a total of about 3000 continuum sources within 2.5 degrees of the center of M51. We made small Stokes Q and U images centered on each source brighter than 100 mJy in total intensity (201 sources) and used RM synthesis to create corresponding Faraday cubes that were analyzed individually. For each source, the noise distribution function was determined from a subset of measurements at high Faraday depths where no polarization is expected; the peaks in polarized intensity in the Faraday spectrum were identified and the p-value of each source was calculated. Finally, the false discovery rate method was applied to the list of p-values to produce a list of polarized sources and quantify the reliability of the detections. We also analyzed sources fainter than 100 mJy but that were reported as polarized in the literature at at least another radio frequency. Of the 201 sources that were searched for polarization, 6 polarized sources were detected confidently (with a false discovery rate of 5 percent). This corresponds to a number density of 1 polarized source per 3.3 square degrees, or 0.3 source/square degree. [Abridged]},

  abstract      = {Upcoming surveys with new radio observatories such as the Square Kilometer Array will generate a wealth of imaging data containing large numbers of radio galaxies. Different classes of radio galaxies can be used as tracers of the cosmic environment, including the dark matter density field, to address key cosmological questions. Classifying these galaxies based on morphology is thus an important step toward achieving the science goals of next generation radio surveys. Radio galaxies have been traditionally been classified as Fanaroff-Riley (FR) I and II, although some exhibit more complex 'bent' morphologies arising from environmental factors or intrinsic properties. In this work we present the FIRST Classifier, an on-line system for automated classification of Compact and Extended radio sources. We developed the FIRST Classifier based on a trained Deep Convolutional Neural Network Model to automate the morphological classification of compact and extended radio sources observed in the FIRST radio survey. Our model achieved an overall accuracy of 97\% and a recall of 98\%, 100\%, 98\% and 93\% for Compact, BENT, FRI and FRII galaxies respectively. The current version of the FIRST classifier is able to predict the morphological class for a single source or for a list of sources as Compact or Extended (FRI, FRII and BENT).},

  abstract      = {A recent paper by Ge et al. performs a series of experiments with two full spectral fitting codes, pPXF and starlight, finding that the two yield consistent results when the input spectrum is not heavily reddened. For E(B-V) $\gt$ 0.2, however, they claim starlight leads to severe biases in the derived properties. Counterintuitively, and at odds with previous simulations, they find that this behaviour worsens significantly as the signal-to-noise ratio of the input spectrum increases. This communication shows that this is entirely due to an A\_V $\lt$ 1 mag condition imposed while initializing the Markov chains in the code. This choice is normally irrelevant in real-life galaxy work but can become critical in artificial experiments. Alleviating this usually harmless initialization constraint changes the Ge et al. results completely, as was explained to the authors before their publication. We replicate their spectral fitting experiments, finding much smaller biases. Furthermore both bias and scatter in the derived properties all converge as S/N increases, as one would expect. We also show how the very output of the code provides ways of diagnosing anomalies in the fits. The code behaviour has been documented in careful and extensive experiments in the literature, but the biased analysis of Ge et al. is just not representative of starlight at all.},

  abstract    = {We present a new, open source, free semi-analytic model (SAM), named Shark, which is designed to be highly flexible and modular, allowing an easy and systematic exploration of different physical processes and ways of modelling any one of them. We introduce the philosophy behind the building of Shark, and provide a detailed overview of the physical processes and their variants included in the model. Shark is written in C++11 and has been parallelized with OpenMP to allow for efficient exploration of models and parameters. In the version being released (v1.0), we implement several different models for gas cooling, active galactic nuclei, stellar and photo-ionisation feedback, and star formation. We demonstrate the basic performance of Shark using the SURFS simulations on the Planck15 cosmology, by comparing results against a large set of observations, including: the stellar mass function (SMF) and stellar-halo mass relation from z=0 to z=4; the cosmic evolution of the star formation rate density (SFRD), stellar mass, atomic and molecular hydrogen; local gas scaling relations; and structural galaxy properties, finding excellent agreement. Some of these are by construction, as parameters are, for example, tuned to the SMF at z=0, but most are true successes of Shark. We illustrate how Shark can be used to study the systematic effects of the modelling of different physical processes on the galaxy population, by quantifying the sensitivity of the scatter of the main sequence of star formation and the gas scaling relations on the adopted star formation law and of the SFRD and $\Omega_{\rm H_2}$ on the H$_2$ depletion timescale of starbursts. We compare Shark with other SAMs and the hydrodynamical simulation EAGLE, and find that SAMs have a much higher halo baryon fraction due to large amounts of intra-halo gas, which in the case of EAGLE is in the intergalactic medium.},

  abstract      = {We present a simple, efficient and robust approach to improve cosmological redshift measurements. The method is based on the presence of a reference sample for which a precise redshift number distribution (dN/dz) can be obtained for different pencil-beam-like sub-volumes within the original survey. For each sub-volume we then impose: (i) that the redshift number distribution of the uncertain redshift measurements matches the reference dN/dz corrected by their selection functions; and (ii) the rank order in redshift of the original ensemble of uncertain measurements is preserved. The latter step is motivated by the fact that random variables drawn from Gaussian probability density functions (PDFs) of different means and arbitrarily large standard deviations satisfy stochastic ordering. We then repeat this simple algorithm for multiple arbitrary pencil-beam-like overlapping sub-volumes; in this manner, each uncertain measurement has multiple (non-independent) ``recovered'' redshifts which can be used to estimate a new redshift PDF. We refer to this method as the Stochastic Order Redshift Technique (SORT). We have used a state-of-the-art N-body simulation to test the performance of SORT under simple assumptions and found that it can improve the quality of cosmological redshifts in an efficient and robust manner. Particularly, SORT redshifts are able to recover the distinctive features of the 'cosmic web' and can provide unbiased measurement of the two-point correlation function on scales $\gt$ 4 Mpc/h. Given its simplicity, we envision that a method like SORT can be incorporated into more sophisticated algorithms aimed to exploit the full potential of large extragalactic photometric surveys.},

After 25 epochs training, We obtain a near-perfect test accuracy of 0.9954 for our model, and the corresponding loss is 0.0028. We then apply our Resnet model to our predictive data contained with 174 known lens candidates. Finally we obtain 1232 hits including 161 (92.5\%) of the 174 known candidates. Apart form the hits found in other works, our Resnet model also find 536 new hits. We then perform several subsequent selections to these 536 hits and present 6 most believable lens candidates in this paper.},

Certain astronomical questions, such as the evolution of the luminosity function of galaxies, require transforming these inherently redshift-dependent magnitudes into redshift-independent quantities. To prepare to address these astronomical questions, investigated in detail in subsequent papers, we fit spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to broadband photometric observations in the context of the optical observations of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Linear combinations of four spectral templates can reproduce the five SDSS magnitudes of all galaxies to the precision of the photometry. Expressed in the appropriate coordinate system, the locus of the coefficients multiplying the templates is planar and, in fact, nearly linear. The resulting reconstructed SEDs can be used to recover fixed-frame magnitudes over a range of redshifts. This process yields consistent results in the sense that, within each sample, the intrinsic colors of similar type galaxies are nearly constant with redshift. We compare our results with simpler interpolation methods and galaxy spectrophotometry from the SDSS. The software that generates these results is publicly available and easily adapted to handle a wide range of galaxy observations.  Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.},

We have trained SPIT on 2004 human-classified images taken with the Kast spectrometer at Lick Observatory with types of Bias, Arc, Flat, Science, and Standard. We include several preprocessing steps (scaling, trimming) motivated by human practice and also expanded the training set to balance between image type and increase diversity. The algorithm achieved an accuracy of 98.7\% on the held-out validation set and an accuracy of 98.7\% on the test set of images. We then adopt a slightly modified classification scheme to improve robustness at a modestly reduced cost in accuracy (98.2\%). The majority of mis-classifications are Science frames with very faint sources confused with Arc images (e.g., faint emission line galaxies) or Science frames with very bright sources confused with Standard stars. These are errors that even a well-trained human is prone to make. Future work will increase the training set from Kast, will include additional optical and near-IR instruments, and may expand the CNN architecture complexity. We are now incorporating SPIT in the PYPIT data reduction pipeline (DRP) and are willing to facilitate its inclusion in other DRPs.},

This phenomenon, called the blue nugget (BN) phase, is the compact star-forming phase in the central regions of many growing galaxies that follows an earlier phase of gas compaction and is followed by a central quenching phase. We train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with mock ``observed'' images of simulated galaxies at three phases of evolution: pre-BN, BN and post-BN, and demonstrate that the CNN successfully retrieves the three phases in other simulated galaxies. We show that BNs are identified by the CNN within a time window of $\sim0.15$ Hubble times. When the trained CNN is applied to observed galaxies from the CANDELS survey at $z=1-3$, it successfully identifies galaxies at the three phases. We find that the observed BNs are preferentially found in galaxies at a characteristic stellar mass range, $10^{9.2-10.3} M\_\odot$ at all redshifts. This is consistent with the characteristic galaxy mass for BNs as detected in the simulations, and is meaningful because it is revealed in the observations when the direct information concerning the total galaxy luminosity has been eliminated from the training set. This technique can be applied to the classification of other astrophysical phenomena for improved comparison of theory and observations in the era of large imaging surveys and cosmological simulations.},

A one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESAstar, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very low mass to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESAstar solves the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data, and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined public interface to facilitate independent development. Several detailed examples indicate the extensive verification and testing that is continuously performed and demonstrate the wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets to very old ages; the complete evolutionary track of a 1 M $_{sun}$ star from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core burning phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning asymptotic giant branch phase; the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the onset of core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron star.

When the main sequence turn-off is detected, MORGOTH can fit the star formation history and the red giant branch mass loss at the same time, efficiently breaking this degeneracy. As part of testing MORGOTH, we also model the observed colour-magnitude diagram of the well studied Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We recover a new more detailed star formation history for this galaxy. Both the new star formation history and the red giant branch mass loss we determined for Sculptor with MORGOTH are in good agreement with previous analyses, thus demonstrating the power of this new approach.},

  abstract      = {Mira variables are useful distance indicators, due to their high luminosities and well-defined period-luminosity relation. We select 1863 Miras from SAAO and MACHO observations to examine their use as distance estimators in the Milky Way. We measure a distance to the Galactic centre of $R\_0 = 7.9 \pm 0.3$ kpc, which is in good agreement with other literature values. The uncertainty has two components of $\sim$0.2 kpc each: the first is from our analysis and predominantly due to interstellar extinction, the second is due to zero-point uncertainties extrinsic to our investigation, such as the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). In an attempt to improve existing period-luminosity calibrations, we use theoretical models of Miras to determine the dependence of the period-luminosity relation on age, metallicity, and helium abundance, under the assumption that Miras trace the bulk stellar population. We find that at a fixed period of $\log P = 2.4$, changes in the predicted $K\_s$ magnitudes can be approximated by $\Delta M\_{Ks} \approx -0.109(\Delta \rm{[Fe/H]}) + 0.033( {\Delta}t/\rm{Gyr}) + 0.021 ({\Delta}Y/0.01)$, and these coefficients are nearly independent of period. The expected overestimate in the Galactic centre distance from using an LMC-calibrated relation is $\sim$0.3 kpc. This prediction is not validated by our analysis; a few possible reasons are discussed. We separately show that while the predicted color-color diagrams of solar-neighbourhood Miras work well in the near-infrared, though there are offsets from the model predictions in the optical and mid-infrared.},

To achieve this we have carried out a major observational campaign using the OMR long-slit spectrograph mounted on the NAOC 2.16$\backslash$,m telescope and the YFOSC long-slit spectrograph mounted on the YNAO 2.4$\backslash$,m telescope. The original sample is based on the MILES library, supplemented by 918 stars selected from PASTEL database. In total, 822 OMR and 1,324 YFOSC spectra, covering respectively the wavelength ranges $\lambda\lambda$3800--5180 and $\lambda\lambda$5150--9000, have been collected and reduced. The spectra have a mean resolution FWHM (full-width at half-maximum) of $\sim 3.3$$\backslash$,$\{$$\backslash$AA$\}$ and are wavelength- and flux-calibrated to an accuracy of $\sim 20$$\backslash$,km$\backslash$,s$^{-1}$ and $\sim 5$$\backslash$,per$\backslash$,cent, respectively. The spectra are further corrected for systematic errors in the wavelength calibration to an accuracy of $\sim 4$$\backslash$,km$\backslash$,s$^{-1}$ by cross-correlating with the theoretical spectra. Almost all the spectra have an average signal to noise ratio (SNR) better than 100 per pixel. Combined with the MILES spectra, there are now 1,731, 1,542, 1,324 and 1,273 stars with spectra covering respectively $\lambda\lambda$3800--5180, $\lambda\lambda$3800--7500, $\lambda\lambda$5150--9000 and $\lambda\lambda$3800--9000.

  abstract      = {Luminous and Ultra-Luminous InfraRed Galaxies ((U)LIRGs) are rare today but are increasingly abundant at high redshifts. They are believed to be dusty starbursts, and hence should have high rates of supernovae (multiple events per year). Due to their extremely dusty environment, however, such supernovae could only be detected in restframe infrared and longer wavelengths, where our current facilities lack the capability to find them individually beyond the local universe. We propose a new technique for higher redshifts, which is to search for the presence of supernovae through the variability of the integrated restframe infrared light of the entire hosts. We present a pilot study to assess the feasibility of this technique. We exploit a unique region, the ``IRAC Dark Field'' (IDF), that the Spitzer Space Telescope has observed for more than 14 years in 3--5 micron. The IDF also has deep far-infrared data (200--550 micron) from the Herschel Space Observatory, which allow us to select high-redshift (U)LIRGs. We obtain a sample of (U)LIRGs that have secure optical counterparts, and examine their light curves in 3--5 micron. While the variabilities could also be caused by AGNs, we show that such contaminations can be identified. We present two cases where the distinct features in their light curves are consistent with multiple supernovae overlapping in time. Searching for supernovae this way will be relevant to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to probe high-redshift (U)LIRGs into their nuclear regions where JWST will be limited by its resolution.},

The stacked emission is unresolved, with a rest-frame 1.4 GHz luminosity of $\rm L\_{1.4 \; GHz} = (4.13 \pm 0.24) \times 10^{22}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. We used the local relation between total star formation rate (SFR) and 1.4 GHz luminosity to infer a median total SFR of $\rm (24.4 \pm 1.4)\; M\_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for blue star-forming galaxies with $\rm M\_B \leq -21$ at $0.7 \lesssim z \lesssim 1.45$. This is is $\approx 4.7$, $\approx 2.5$ and $\approx 2.0$ times larger than the median SFRs inferred from the rest-frame near-ultraviolet luminosity, the rest-frame U-band luminosity, and the O$\{$$\backslash$sc ii$\}$$\lambda$3727$\backslash$AA$\backslash$ line luminosity. We detect the main-sequence relation between SFR and stellar mass, $\rm M\_\star$, obtaining $\rm SFR = (13.4 \pm 1.8) \times [(M\_{\star}/(10^{10} \;M\_\odot)]^{0.73 \pm 0.09} \; M\_\odot \; yr^{-1}$; the power-law index shows no change over $z \approx 0.7 - 1.45$.

  abstract      = {There is significant scientific value to be gained from combining AKARI fluxes with data at other far-IR wavelengths from the IRAS and Herschel missions. To be able to do this we must ensure that there are no systematic differences between the datasets that need to be corrected before the fluxes are compatible with each other. One such systematic effect identified in the BSCv1 data is the issue of beam corrections. We determine these for the BSCv2 data by correlating ratios of appropriate IRAS and AKARI bands with the difference in 2MASS J band extended and point source magnitudes for sources cross matched between the IRAS FSC, AKARI BSCv2 and 2MASS catalogs. We find significant correlations (p$\lt$$\lt$ 10\^{}-13) indicating that beam corrections are necessary in the 65 and 90 micron bands. We then use these corrected fluxes to supplement existing data in spectral energy distribution (SED) fits for ultraluminous infrared galaxies in the HERUS survey. The addition of AKARI fluxes makes little difference to the results of simple (T,beta) fits to the SEDs of these sources, though there is a general decrease in reduced chi\^{}2 values. The utility of the extra AKARI data, however, is in allowing physically more realistic SED models with more parameters to be fit to the data. We also extend our analysis of beam correction issues in the AKARI data by examining the Herschel Reference Sample, which have Herschel photometry from 100 to 500 microns and which are more spatially extended than the HERUS ULIRGs. Thirty-four of the HRS sources have good Herschel SEDs and matching data from AKARI. This investigation finds that our simple 2MASS-based beam correction scheme is inadequate for these larger and more complex sources. There are also indications that additional beam corrections at 140 and 160 microns are needed for these sources, extended on scales $\gt$1 arcminute.},

  abstract      = {We introduce SimBAL, a novel spectral-synthesis procedure that uses large grids of ionic column densities generated by the photoionization code Cloudy and a Bayesian model calibration to forward-model broad absorption line quasar spectra. We used SimBAL to analyze the HST COS spectrum of the low-redshift BALQ SDSS J085053.12+445122.5. SimBAL analysis yielded velocity-resolved information about the physical conditions of the absorbing gas. We found that the ionization parameter and column density increase, and the covering fraction decreases as a function of velocity. The total log column density is 22.9 (22.4) [cm\^{}-2] for solar (Z=3Z\_$\backslash$odot) metallicity. The outflow lies 1--3 parsecs from the central engine, consistent with the estimated location of the torus. The mass outflow rate is 17--28 M\_$\backslash$odot yr\^{}-1, the momentum flux is consistent with L\_Bol/c, and the ratio of the kinematic to bolometric luminosity is 0.8--0.9\%. The outflow velocity is similar to the escape velocity at the absorber's location, and force multiplier analysis indicates that part of the outflow could originate in resonance-line driving. The location near the torus suggests that dust scattering may play a role in the acceleration, although the lack of reddening in this UV-selected object indictes a relatively dust-free line of sight. The low accretion rate (0.06 L\_Edd) and compact outflow suggests that SDSS\~{}J0850+4451 might be a quasar past its era of feedback, although since its mass outflow is about 8 times the accretion rate, the wind is likely integral to the accretion physics of the central engine.},

  abstract      = {Deep learning with artificial neural networks is increasingly gaining attention, because of its potential for data-driven astronomy. However, this methodology usually does not provide uncertainties and does not deal with incompleteness and noise in the training data. In this work, we design a neural network for high-resolution spectroscopic analysis using APOGEE data that mimics the methodology of standard spectroscopic analyses: stellar parameters are determined using the full wavelength range, but individual element abundances use censored portions of the spectrum. We train this network with a customized objective function that deals with incomplete and noisy training data and apply dropout variational inference to derive uncertainties on our predictions. We determine parameters and abundances for 18 individual elements at the $\approx 0.03$ dex level, even at low signal-to-noise ratio. We demonstrate that the uncertainties returned by our method are a realistic estimate of the precision and they automatically blow up when inputs or outputs outside of the training set are encountered, thus shielding users from unwanted extrapolation. By using standard deep-learning tools for GPU acceleration, our method is extremely fast, allowing analysis of the entire APOGEE data set of $\approx250,000$ spectra in ten minutes on a singe, low-cost GPU. We release the stellar parameters and 18 individual-element abundances with associated uncertainty for the entire APOGEE DR14 dataset. Simultaneously, we release astroNN, a well-tested, open-source python package developed for this work, but that is also designed to be a general package for deep learning in astronomy. astroNN is available at https://github.com/henrysky/astroNN with extensive documentation at http://astroNN.readthedocs.io.},

Both these measurements are in good agreement with values presented in previous works with Sculptor RR Lyrae stars in optical bands, and are also consistent with recent near-infrared RR Lyrae results. Best agreement with the literature is found for the latter modulus which is equivalent to a distance of d = 82 $\pm$ 1 (statistical) $\pm$ 2 (photometric) kpc (with $\sigma\_{sys}=$ = 4 kpc).

At present, its uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty in the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), which, being our second-closest galaxy, serves as the best anchor point for the cosmic distance scale. Observations of eclipsing binaries offer a unique opportunity to measure stellar parameters and distances precisely and accurately. The eclipsing-binary method was previously applied to the LMC, but the accuracy of the distance results was lessened by the need to model the bright, early-type systems used in those studies. Here we report determinations of the distances to eight long-period, late-type eclipsing systems in the LMC, composed of cool, giant stars. For these systems, we can accurately measure both the linear and the angular sizes of their components and avoid the most important problems related to the hot, early-type systems. The LMC distance that we derive from these systems (49.97 +/- 0.19 (statistical) +/- 1.11 (systematic) kiloparsecs) is accurate to 2.2 per cent and provides a firm base for a 3-per-cent determination of the Hubble constant, with prospects for improvement to 2 per cent in the future.},

  abstract      = {Broadband photometry offers a time and cost effective method to reconstruct the continuum emission of celestial objects. Thus, photometric redshift estimation has supported the scientific exploitation of extragalactic multiwavelength surveys for more than twenty years. In the era of precision cosmology, with the upcoming Euclid and LSST surveys, very tight constraints are put on the expected performance of photometric redshift estimation using broadband photometry, thus new methods have to be developed in order to reach the required performance. We present a novel automatic method of optimizing photometric redshift performance, the classification-aided photometric redshift estimation (CPz). The main feature of CPz is the unified treatment of all classes of objects detected in extragalactic surveys: galaxies of any type (passive, starforming and starbursts), active galactic nuclei (AGN), quasi-stellar objects (QSO), stars and also includes the identification of potential photometric redshift catastrophic outliers. The method operates in three stages. First, the photometric catalog is confronted with star, galaxy and QSO model templates by means of spectral energy distribution fitting. Second, three machine-learning classifiers are used to identify 1) the probability of each source to be a star, 2) the optimal photometric redshift model library set-up for each source and 3) the probability to be a photometric redshift catastrophic outlier. Lastly, the final sample is assembled by identifying the probability thresholds to be applied on the outcome of each of the three classifiers. We apply our method to the near-infrared VISTA public surveys, matched with optical photometry from CFHTLS, KIDS and SDSS, mid-infrared WISE photometry. We show that CPz offers improved photometric redshift performance for both normal galaxies and AGN without the need for extra X-ray information. [abridged]},

  abstract      = {Whether aimed for the study of the planetary systems, the distribution of the stars in the galaxies or the formation of the large-scale structures in the Universe, the sizes of numerical simulations are becoming increasingly important in terms of their virtual volumes and computer memories. The visualization of the data becomes more complicated with the requirement of the exposition of the large number of data points. In order to lighten such burden, Virtual Observatories (VO) have been developed and are now essential tools in astronomy to share existing data, for visualization and for data analysis. Using a software, currently being developed at the Centre de Donn$\backslash$'ees de Strasbourg (CDS) jointly with the Astronomical Observatory of Strasbourg, we show how three-dimensional radiative transfer simulations of active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be visualized in order to extract new information. The ability to zoom over ten orders of magnitude and to journey inside/between the multiple scattering regions allows to identify where emission, scattering, and absorption truly take place. Among all the new possibilities offered by the software, it is possible to test the single-scattering hypothesis or evaluate the impact of fragmentation onto the propagation of light echoes within the broad line region (BLR) or the circumnuclear region (torus).},

  abstract      = {Fitting the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies is an almost universally used technique that has matured significantly in the last decade. Model predictions and fitting procedures have improved significantly over this time, attempting to keep up with the vastly increased volume and quality of available data. We review here the field of SED fitting, describing the modelling of ultraviolet to infrared galaxy SEDs, the creation of multiwavelength data sets, and the methods used to fit model SEDs to observed galaxy data sets. We touch upon the achievements and challenges in the major ingredients of SED fitting, with a special emphasis on describing the interplay between the quality of the available data, the quality of the available models, and the best fitting technique to use in order to obtain a realistic measurement as well as realistic uncertainties. We conclude that SED fitting can be used effectively to derive a range of physical properties of galaxies, such as redshift, stellar masses, star formation rates, dust masses, and metallicities, with care taken not to over-interpret the available data. Yet there still exist many issues such as estimating the age of the oldest stars in a galaxy, finer details of dust properties and dust-star geometry, and the influences of poorly understood, luminous stellar types and phases. The challenge for the coming years will be to improve both the models and the observational data sets to resolve these uncertainties. The present review will be made available on an interactive, moderated web page (http://sedfitting.org), where the community can access and change the text. The intention is to expand the text and keep it up to date over the coming years.},

We apply the machine learning classification to 85,613,922 objects in the $Gaia$ data release 2, based on the combination of the Pan-STARRS 1 and AllWISE data. The classification results are cross-matched with Simbad database, and the total accuracy is 91.9\%. Our sample is dominated by stars, $\sim$ 98\%, and galaxies makes up 2\%. For the objects with negative parallaxes, about 2.5$\backslash$\% are galaxies and QSOs, while about 99.9\% are stars if the relative parallax uncertainties are smaller than 0.2. Our result implies that using the threshold of 0 $\lt \sigma\_\pi/\pi \lt$ 0.2 could yield a very clean stellar sample.},

  abstract      = {We have fit the far-ultraviolet (FUV) to sub-millimeter (850 micron) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the 61 galaxies from the ``Key Insights on Nearby Galaxies: A Far-Infrared Survey with Herschel'' (KINGFISH). The fitting has been performed using three models: the Code for Investigating GALaxy Evolution (CIGALE), the GRAphite-SILicate approach (GRASIL), and the Multi-wavelength Analysis of Galaxy PHYSical properties (MAGPHYS). We have analyzed the results of the three codes in terms of the SED shapes, and by comparing the derived quantities with simple ``recipes'' for stellar mass (Mstar), star-formation rate (SFR), dust mass (Mdust), and monochromatic luminosities. Although the algorithms rely on different assumptions for star-formation history, dust attenuation and dust reprocessing, they all well approximate the observed SEDs and are in generally good agreement for the associated quantities. However, the three codes show very different behavior in the mid-infrared regime, in particular between 25 and 70 micron where there are no observational constraints for the KINGFISH sample. We find that different algorithms give discordant SFR estimates for galaxies with low specific SFR, and that the standard ``recipes'' for calculating FUV absorption overestimate the extinction compared to the SED-fitting results. Results also suggest that assuming a ``standard'' constant stellar mass-to-light ratio overestimates Mstar relative to the SED fitting, and we provide new SED-based formulations for estimating Mstar from WISE W1 (3.4 micron) luminosities and colors. From a Principal Component Analysis of Mstar, SFR, Mdust, and O/H, we reproduce previous scaling relations among Mstar, SFR, and O/H, and find that Mdust can be predicted to within roughly 0.3 dex using only Mstar and SFR.},

  abstract      = {We present a principled Bayesian framework for signal reconstruction, in which the signal is modelled by basis functions whose number (and form, if required) is determined by the data themselves. This approach is based on a Bayesian interpretation of conventional sparse reconstruction and regularisation techniques, in which sparsity is imposed through priors via Bayesian model selection. We demonstrate our method for noisy 1- and 2-dimensional signals, including astronomical images. Furthermore, by using a product-space approach, the number and type of basis functions can be treated as integer parameters and their posterior distributions sampled directly. We show that order-of-magnitude increases in computational efficiency are possible from this technique compared to calculating the Bayesian evidences separately, and that further computational gains are possible using it in combination with dynamic nested sampling. Our approach can be readily applied to neural networks, where it allows the network architecture to be determined by the data in a principled Bayesian manner by treating the number of nodes and hidden layers as parameters.},
