  abstract = {We present a new high-resolution N -body algorithm for cosmological simulations. The algorithm employs a traditional particle-mesh technique on a cubic grid and successive multilevel relaxations on the finer meshes, introduced recursively in a fully adaptive manner in the regions where the density exceeds a predefined threshold. The mesh is generated to effectively match an arbitrary geometry of the underlying density field—a property particularly important for cosmological simulations. In a simulation the mesh structure is not created at every time step but is properly adjusted to the evolving particle distribution. The algorithm is fast and effectively parallel: the gravitational relaxation solver is approximately half as fast as the fast Fourier transform solver on the same number of mesh cells. The required CPU time scales with the number of cells, N c , as ~ O ( N c ). The code allows us to improve considerably the spatial resolution of the particle-mesh code without loss in mass resolution. We present a detailed description of the methodology, implementation, and tests of the code. We further use the code to study the structure of dark matter halos in high-resolution (~2 h -1 kpc) simulations of standard CDM (Ω = 1, h = 0.5, σ 8 = 0.63) and ΛCDM (Ω Λ = 1 - Ω 0 = 0.7, h = 0.7, σ 8 = 1.0) models. We find that halo density profiles in both CDM and ΛCDM models are well fitted by the analytical model presented recently by Navarro et al., which predicts a singular [ρ( r ) ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} r -1 ] behavior of the halo density profiles at small radii. We therefore conclude that halos formed in the ΛCDM model have structure similar to that of CDM halos and thus cannot explain the dynamics of the central parts of dwarf spiral galaxies, as inferred from the galaxies' rotation curves.},

  title       = {Calibrated, cosmological hydrodynamical simulations with variable IMFs I: Method and effect on global galaxy scaling relations},
  abstract    = {The recently inferred variations in the stellar initial mass function (IMF) among local high-mass early-type galaxies may require a reinterpretation of observations of galaxy populations and may have important consequences for the predictions of models of galaxy formation and evolution. We present a new pair of cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations based on the EAGLE model that self-consistently adopt an IMF that respectively becomes bottom- or top-heavy in high-pressure environments for individual star-forming gas particles. In such models, the excess stellar mass-to-light ($M/L$) ratio with respect to a reference IMF is increased due to an overabundance of low-mass dwarf stars or stellar remnants, respectively. Crucially, both pressure-dependent IMFs have been calibrated to reproduce the observed trends of increasing excess $M/L$ with central stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_e$) in early-type galaxies, while maintaining agreement with the observables used to calibrate the EAGLE model, namely the galaxy luminosity function, half-light radii of late-type galaxies, and black hole masses. We find that while the $M/L$ excess is a good measure of the IMF for low-mass slope variations, it depends strongly on the age of the stellar population for high-mass slope variations. The normalization of the [Mg/Fe]$-\sigma_e$ relation is decreased (increased) for bottom- (top-)heavy IMF variations, while the slope is not strongly affected. Bottom-heavy variations have little impact on galaxy metallicities, half-light radii of early-type galaxies, or star formation rates, while top-heavy variations significantly increase these quantities for high-mass galaxies, leading to tension with observations.},

Astrophysicists use the simulations to study the emergence of galaxy populations from the Big Bang, as well as the formation of stars and supermassive black holes. For cosmologists, galaxy formation simulations are needed to understand how baryonic processes affect measurements of dark matter and dark energy. Owing to the extreme dynamic range of galaxy formation, advances are driven by novel approaches using simulations with different tradeoffs between volume and resolution. Large-volume but low-resolution simulations provide the best statistics, while higher-resolution simulations of smaller cosmic volumes can be evolved with self-consistent physics and reveal important emergent phenomena. I summarize recent progress in galaxy formation simulations, including major developments in the past five years, and highlight some key areas likely to drive further advances over the next decade.},

  abstract      = {We present age distribution matching, a theoretical formalism for predicting how galaxies of luminosity L and colour C occupy dark matter haloes. Our model supposes that there are just two fundamental properties of a halo that determine the colour and brightness of the galaxy it hosts: the maximum circular velocity V$_{max}$ and the redshift z$_{starve}$ that correlates with the epoch at which the star formation in the galaxy ceases. The halo property z$_{starve}$ is intended to encompass physical characteristics of halo mass assembly that may deprive the galaxy of its cold gas supply and, ultimately, quench its star formation. The new, defining feature of the model is that, at fixed luminosity, galaxy colour is in monotonic correspondence with z$_{starve}$, with the larger values of z$_{starve}$ being assigned redder colours. We populate an N-body simulation with a mock galaxy catalogue based on age distribution matching and show that the resulting mock galaxy distribution accurately describes a variety of galaxy statistics. Our model suggests that halo and galaxy assembly are indeed correlated. We make publicly available our low-redshift, Sloan Digital Sky Survey M$_{r}$ $\lt$ -19 mock galaxy catalogue, and main progenitor histories of all z = 0 haloes, at http://logrus.uchicago.edu/\~{}aphearin},

  abstract      = {We use cosmological simulations to study a characteristic evolution pattern of high-redshift galaxies. Early, stream-fed, highly perturbed, gas-rich discs undergo phases of dissipative contraction into compact, star-forming systems (`blue' nuggets) at z {\tilde} 4-2. The peak of gas compaction marks the onset of central gas depletion and inside-out quenching into compact ellipticals (red nuggets) by z {\tilde} 2. These are sometimes surrounded by gas rings or grow extended dry stellar envelopes. The compaction occurs at a roughly constant specific star formation rate (SFR), and the quenching occurs at a constant stellar surface density within the inner kpc ({$\Sigma$}$_{1}$). Massive galaxies quench earlier, faster, and at a higher {$\Sigma$}$_{1}$ than lower mass galaxies, which compactify and attempt to quench more than once. This evolution pattern is consistent with the way galaxies populate the SFR-size-mass space, and with gradients and scatter across the main sequence. The compaction is triggered by an intense inflow episode, involving (mostly minor) mergers, counter-rotating streams or recycled gas, and is commonly associated with violent disc instability. The contraction is dissipative, with the inflow rate $\gt$SFR, and the maximum {$\Sigma$}$_{1}$ anticorrelated with the initial spin parameter. The central quenching is triggered by the high SFR and stellar/supernova feedback (maybe also active galactic nucleus feedback) due to the high central gas density, while the central inflow weakens as the disc vanishes. Suppression of fresh gas supply by a hot halo allows the long-term maintenance of quenching once above a threshold halo mass, inducing the quenching downsizing.},

  abstract      = {We present a new statistical method to determine the relationship between the stellar masses of galaxies and the masses of their host dark matter haloes over the entire cosmic history from z {\tilde} 4 to the present. This multi-epoch abundance matching (MEAM) model self-consistently takes into account that satellite galaxies first become satellites at times earlier than they are observed. We employ a redshift-dependent parametrization of the stellar-to-halo-mass relation to populate haloes and subhaloes in the Millennium simulations with galaxies, requiring that the observed stellar mass functions at several redshifts are reproduced simultaneously. We show that physically meaningful growth of massive galaxies is consistent with these data only if observational mass errors are taken into account. Using merger trees extracted from the dark matter simulations in combination with MEAM, we predict the average assembly histories of galaxies, separating into star formation within the galaxies (in situ) and accretion of stars (ex situ). Our main results are the peak star formation efficiency decreases with redshift from 23 per cent at z = 0 to 9 per cent at z =4 while the corresponding halo mass increases from 10$^{11.8}$ to 10$^{12.5}$ M$_{⊙}$. The star formation rate of central galaxies peaks at a redshift which depends on halo mass; for massive haloes this peak is at early cosmic times while for low-mass galaxies the peak has not been reached yet. In haloes similar to that of the Milky Way about half of the central stellar mass is assembled after z = 0.7. In low-mass haloes, the accretion of satellites contributes little to the assembly of their central galaxies, while in massive haloes more than half of the central stellar mass is formed ex situ with significant accretion of satellites at z $\lt$ 2. We find that our method implies a cosmic star formation history and an evolution of specific star formation rates which are consistent with those inferred directly. We present convenient fitting functions for stellar masses, star formation rates and accretion rates as functions of halo mass and redshift.},

Here, we present first results on the galaxy colour bimodality at low redshift. Accounting for the attenuation of stellar light by dust, we compare the simulated (g - r) colours of 10$^{9}$ $\lt$ M$_{⋆}$/M$_{⊙}$ $\lt$ 10$^{12.5}$ galaxies to the observed distribution from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find a striking improvement with respect to the original Illustris simulation, as well as excellent quantitative agreement with the observations, with a sharp transition in median colour from blue to red at a characteristic M$_{⋆}$ {\tilde} 10$^{10.5}$ M$_{⊙}$. Investigating the build-up of the colour-mass plane and the formation of the red sequence, we demonstrate that the primary driver of galaxy colour transition is supermassive black hole feedback in its low accretion state. Across the entire population the median colour transition time-scale {$\Delta$}t$_{green}$ is {\tilde}1.6 Gyr, a value which drops for increasingly massive galaxies. We find signatures of the physical process of quenching: at fixed stellar mass, redder galaxies have lower star formation rates, gas fractions, and gas metallicities; their stellar populations are also older and their large-scale interstellar magnetic fields weaker than in bluer galaxies. Finally, we measure the amount of stellar mass growth on the red sequence. Galaxies with M$_{⋆}$ $\gt$ 10$^{11}$ M$_{⊙}$ which redden at z $\lt$ 1 accumulate on average {\tilde}25 per cent of their final z = 0 mass post-reddening; at the same time, {\tilde}18 per cent of such massive galaxies acquire half or more of their final stellar mass while on the red sequence.},

Nevertheless, galaxies of the same size were actively forming stars when the universe was only a few billion years old. Tacchella et al. used integral-field spectroscopy and high-resolution imaging to map the distributions of star formation rates and stellar mass densities within ancient galaxies. Star formation apparently quenched first in the center, while remaining lively in the galactic outskirts, with quenching taking a few billion years to proceed outward.Science, this issue p. 314 Most present-day galaxies with stellar masses >=1011 solar masses show no ongoing star formation and are dense spheroids. Ten billion years ago, similarly massive galaxies were typically forming stars at rates of hundreds solar masses per year. It is debated how star formation ceased, on which time scales, and how this {\textquotedblleft}quenching{\textquotedblright} relates to the emergence of dense spheroids. We measured stellar mass and star-formation rate surface density distributions in star-forming galaxies at redshift 2.2 with ~1-kiloparsec resolution. We find that, in the most massive galaxies, star formation is quenched from the inside out, on time scales less than 1 billion years in the inner regions, up to a few billion years in the outer disks. These galaxies sustain high star-formation activity at large radii, while hosting fully grown and already quenched bulges in their cores.},

The highest resolution simulation, Illustris-1, covers a volume of (106.5 Mpc)$^{3}$, has a dark mass resolution of 6.26 {\times} 10$^{6}$ M$_{⊙}$, and an initial baryonic matter mass resolution of 1.26 {\times} 10$^{6}$ M$_{⊙}$. At z = 0 gravitational forces are softened on scales of 710 pc, and the smallest hydrodynamical gas cells have an extent of 48 pc. We follow the dynamical evolution of 2 {\times} 1820$^{3}$ resolution elements and in addition passively evolve 1820$^{3}$ Monte Carlo tracer particles reaching a total particle count of more than 18 billion. The galaxy formation model includes: primordial and metal-line cooling with self-shielding corrections, stellar evolution, stellar feedback, gas recycling, chemical enrichment, supermassive black hole growth, and feedback from active galactic nuclei. Here we describe the simulation suite, and contrast basic predictions of our model for the present-day galaxy population with observations of the local universe. At z = 0 our simulation volume contains about 40 000 well-resolved galaxies covering a diverse range of morphologies and colours including early-type, late-type and irregular galaxies. The simulation reproduces reasonably well the cosmic star formation rate density, the galaxy luminosity function, and baryon conversion efficiency at z = 0. It also qualitatively captures the impact of galaxy environment on the red fractions of galaxies. The internal velocity structure of selected well-resolved disc galaxies obeys the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation together with flat circular velocity curves. In the well-resolved regime, the simulation reproduces the observed mix of early-type and late-type galaxies. Our model predicts a halo mass dependent impact of baryonic effects on the halo mass function and the masses of haloes caused by feedback from supernova and active galactic nuclei.},

  abstract = {We present self-consistent 3D simulations of the formation of virialized systems containing both gas and dark matter. Using a fully Lagrangian code based on the smooth particle hydrodynamics technique and a tree data structure, we follow the evolution of regions of comoving radius 2-3 Mpc with proper inclusion of the tidal effects of surrounding material. Initial conditions at high redshifts assume an Einstein-de Sitter universe, a biased cold dark matter perturbation spectrum (b = 2.5), and a baryonic mass fraction of 10 per cent. The gas is initially cold and radiates in the manner expected for a plasma of primordial composition. We neglect star formation and associated processes. We find that most of the gas settles rapidly into centrifugally supported discs at the centers of small dark matter clumps. These are not disrupted during later evolution, and survive the merging of their dark haloes. They either remain distinct, or merge without reheating at a later time. These results confirm that significant energy input from non-gravitational sources is required to produce a cold baryonic fraction consistent with the observed abundance of gas and stars in galaxies. In our simulations, much of the final disc of gas accumulates through mergers of dense clumps rather than through the smooth infall envisaged in earlier models. This process involves substantial angular momentum loss and large collapse factors. It produces discs that are more concentrated than real spiral discs and have circular velocities up to 70 per cent greater than that of the surrounding halo. Nevertheless, the surface density profile of these discs can be reasonably well fitted by an exponential, and their rotation curves are flat out to approximately 5 disc scalelengths. The high efficiency of cooling also results in very low predicted X-ray luminosities for the residual haloes of hot gas.},

The energy supplied per supernova is typically reduced about an order of magnitude by radiative cooling of supernova remnants, but the remaining energy is still sufficient to cause significant gas loss, particularly for small galaxies. in galaxies of smaller mass, gas loss begins earlier and carries away a larger fraction of the initial mass, owing to the lower escape velocity. Model collapse calculations show that the effect of early gas loss is to cause galaxies of smaller mass to have less condensed nuclei, smaller average metal abundances, and smaller metal abundance gradients, in qualitative agreement with the observations.},

  abstract = {We present a smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulation that reproduces a galaxy that is a moderate facsimile of those observed. The primary failing point of previous simulations of disk formation, namely, excessive transport of angular momentum from gas to dark matter, is ameliorated by the inclusion of a supernova feedback algorithm that allows energy to persist in the model interstellar medium for a period corresponding to the lifetime of stellar associations. The inclusion of feedback leads to a disk at a redshift z=0.52, with a specific angular momentum content within 10\% of the value required to fit observations. An exponential fit to the disk baryon surface density gives a scale length within 17\% of the theoretical value. Runs without feedback, with or without star formation, exhibit the drastic angular momentum transport observed elsewhere.},

  abstract = {Employing hydrodynamic simulations of structure formation in a {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter cosmology, we study the history of cosmic star formation from the `dark ages' at redshift z\~{} 20 to the present. In addition to gravity and ordinary hydrodynamics, our model includes radiative heating and cooling of gas, star formation, supernova feedback and galactic winds. By making use of a comprehensive set of simulations on interlocking scales and epochs, we demonstrate numerical convergence of our results on all relevant halo mass scales, ranging from 10$^{8}$ to 10$^{15}$ h$^{-1}$ M$_{solar}$.  The predicted density of cosmic star formation, , is broadly consistent with measurements, given the observational uncertainty. From the present epoch, gradually rises by approximately a factor of 10 to a peak at z\~{} 5-6, which is beyond the redshift range where it has been estimated observationally. In our model, fully 50 per cent of the stars are predicted to have formed by redshift z\~{}= 2.14, and are thus older than 10.4 Gyr, while only 25 per cent form at redshifts lower than z\~{}= 1. The mean age of all stars at the present is approximately 9 Gyr. Our model predicts a total stellar density at z= 0 of {$\Omega$}$_{*}$= 0.004, corresponding to approximately 10 per cent of all baryons being locked up in long-lived stars, in agreement with recent determinations of the luminosity density of the Universe.  We determine the `multiplicity function of cosmic star formation' as a function of redshift; i.e. the distribution of star formation with respect to halo mass. At redshifts around z\~{}= 10, star formation occurs preferentially in haloes of mass 10$^{8}$-10$^{10}$ h$^{-1}$ M$_{solar}$, while at lower redshifts, the dominant contribution to comes from progressively more massive haloes. Integrating over time, we find that approximately 50 per cent of all stars formed in haloes less massive than 10$^{11.5}$ h$^{-1}$ M$_{solar}$, with nearly equal contributions per logarithmic mass interval in the range 10$^{10}$-10$^{13.5}$ h$^{-1}$ M$_{solar}$, making up \~{}70 per cent of the total.  We also briefly examine possible implications of our predicted star formation history for reionization of hydrogen in the Universe. According to our model, the stellar contribution to the ionizing background is expected to rise for redshifts z $\gt$ 3, at least up to redshift z\~{} 5, in accord with estimates from simultaneous measurements of the H and He opacities of the Lyman-{$\alpha$} forest. This suggests that the ultraviolet background will be dominated by stars for z $\gt$ 4, provided that there are not significantly more quasars at high z than are presently known. We measure the clumping factor of the gas from the simulations and estimate the growth of cosmic HII regions, assuming a range of escape fractions for ionizing photons. We find that the star formation rate predicted by the simulations is sufficient to account for hydrogen reionization by z\~{} 6, but only if a high escape fraction close to unity is assumed.},

  abstract      = {We investigate the physics driving the cosmic star formation (SF) history using the more than 50 large, cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations that together comprise the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations project. We systematically vary the parameters of the model to determine which physical processes are dominant and which aspects of the model are robust. Generically, we find that SF is limited by the build-up of dark matter haloes at high redshift, reaches a broad maximum at intermediate redshift and then decreases as it is quenched by lower cooling rates in hotter and lower density gas, gas exhaustion and self-regulated feedback from stars and black holes. The higher redshift SF is therefore mostly determined by the cosmological parameters and to a lesser extent by photoheating from reionization. The location and height of the peak in the SF history, and the steepness of the decline towards the present, depend on the physics and implementation of stellar and black hole feedback. Mass loss from intermediate-mass stars and metal-line cooling both boost the SF rate at late times. Galaxies form stars in a self-regulated fashion at a rate controlled by the balance between, on the one hand, feedback from massive stars and black holes and, on the other hand, gas cooling and accretion. Paradoxically, the SF rate is highly insensitive to the assumed SF law. This can be understood in terms of self-regulation: if the SF efficiency is changed, then galaxies adjust their gas fractions so as to achieve the same rate of production of massive stars. Self-regulated feedback from accreting black holes is required to match the steep decline in the observed SF rate below redshift 2, although more extreme feedback from SF, for example in the form of a top-heavy initial stellar mass function at high gas pressures, can help.},

We discuss the limitations of such simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in which thermal energy is injected into the gas without the need to turn off cooling or decouple hydrodynamical forces, allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, we calibrate them to the present-day galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy stellar mass function is reproduced to {\lsim} 0.2 dex over the full resolved mass range, 10$^{8}$ $\lt$ M$_{*}$/M$_{⊙}$ {\lsim} 10$^{11}$, a level of agreement close to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations. We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive fractions, Tully-Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic C IV and O VI. While the mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent with observations for M$_{*}$ {\gsim} 10$^{9}$ M$_{⊙}$ (M$_{*}$ {\gsim} 10$^{10}$ M$_{⊙}$ at intermediate resolution), they are insufficiently steep at lower masses. For the reference model, the gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for galaxy groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. The EAGLE simulation suite, which also includes physics variations and higher resolution zoomed-in volumes described elsewhere, constitutes a valuable new resource for studies of galaxy formation.},

  abstract = {We simulate the growth of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes by implementing a suite of semi-analytic models on the output of the Millennium Run, a very large simulation of the concordance {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter cosmogony. Our procedures follow the detailed assembly history of each object and are able to track the evolution of all galaxies more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud throughout a volume comparable to that of large modern redshift surveys. In this first paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity of central black holes with a new model for `radio' feedback from those active galactic nuclei that lie at the centre of a quasi-static X-ray-emitting atmosphere in a galaxy group or cluster. We show that for energetically and observationally plausible parameters such a model can simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures, and radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst feedback) can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself requiring star formation. We discuss possible physical models that might explain the accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological `radio mode' model to be successful.},

  abstract      = {We study how optical galaxy morphology depends on mass and star formation rate (SFR) in the Illustris Simulation. To do so, we measure automated galaxy structures in 10 808 simulated galaxies at z = 0 with stellar masses 10$^{9.7}$ $\lt$ M$_{*}$/M$_{⊙}$ $\lt$ 10$^{12.3}$. We add observational realism to idealized synthetic images and measure non-parametric statistics in rest-frame optical and near-IR images from four directions. We find that Illustris creates a morphologically diverse galaxy population, occupying the observed bulge strength locus and reproducing median morphology trends versus stellar mass, SFR, and compactness. Morphology correlates realistically with rotation, following classification schemes put forth by kinematic surveys. Type fractions as a function of environment agree roughly with data. These results imply that connections among mass, star formation, and galaxy structure arise naturally from models matching global star formation and halo occupation functions when simulated with accurate methods. This raises a question of how to construct experiments on galaxy surveys to better distinguish between models. We predict that at fixed halo mass near 10$^{12}$ M$_{⊙}$, disc-dominated galaxies have higher stellar mass than bulge-dominated ones, a possible consequence of the Illustris feedback model. While Illustris galaxies at M$_{*}$ {\tilde} 10$^{11}$ M$_{⊙}$ have a reasonable size distribution, those at M$_{*}$ {\tilde} 10$^{10}$ M$_{⊙}$ have half-light radii larger than observed by a factor of 2. Furthermore, at M$_{*}$ {\tilde} 10$^{10.5}$-10$^{11}$ M$_{⊙}$, a relevant fraction of Illustris galaxies have distinct `ring-like' features, such that the bright pixels have an unusually wide spatial extent.},

Using a very large set of deep adaptive-mesh-refinement simulations, we quantify the dependence of the SFR per free-fall time, epsilon$_{ff}$, on the above parameters. Our main results are (1) that epsilon$_{ff}$ decreases exponentially with increasing t $_{ff}$/t $_{dyn}$, but is insensitive to changes in $\{$$\backslash$cal M$\}$\_s, for constant values of t $_{ff}$/t $_{dyn}$ and $\{$$\backslash$cal M$\}$\_a. (2) Decreasing values of $\{$$\backslash$cal M$\}$\_a (stronger magnetic fields) reduce epsilon$_{ff}$, but only to a point, beyond which epsilon$_{ff}$ increases with a further decrease of $\{$$\backslash$cal M$\}$\_a. (3) For values of $\{$$\backslash$cal M$\}$\_a characteristic of star-forming regions, epsilon$_{ff}$ varies with $\{$$\backslash$cal M$\}$\_a by less than a factor of two. We propose a simple star formation law, based on the empirical fit to the minimum epsilon$_{ff}$, and depending only on t $_{ff}$/t $_{dyn}$: epsilon$_{ff}$ {\ap} epsilon$_{wind}$exp (- 1.6 t $_{ff}$/t $_{dyn}$). Because it only depends on the mean gas density and rms velocity, this law is straightforward to implement in simulations and analytical models of galaxy formation and evolution.},

  abstract      = {Star formation laws are rules that relate the rate of star formation in a particular region, either an entire galaxy or some portion of it, to the properties of the gas, or other galactic properties, in that region. While observations of Local Group galaxies show a very simple, local star formation law in which the star formation rate per unit area in each patch of a galaxy scales linearly with the molecular gas surface density in that patch, recent observations of both Milky Way molecular clouds and high-redshift galaxies apparently show a more complicated relationship in which regions of equal molecular gas surface density can form stars at quite different rates. These data have been interpreted as implying either that different star formation laws may apply in different circumstances, that the star formation law is sensitive to large-scale galaxy properties rather than local properties, or that there are high-density thresholds for star formation. Here we collate observations of the relationship between gas and star formation rate from resolved observations of Milky Way molecular clouds, from kpc-scale observations of Local Group galaxies, and from unresolved observations of both disk and starburst galaxies in the local universe and at high redshift. We show that all of these data are in fact consistent with a simple, local, volumetric star formation law. The apparent variations stem from the fact that the observed objects have a wide variety of three-dimensional size scales and degrees of internal clumping, so even at fixed gas column density the regions being observed can have wildly varying volume densities. We provide a simple theoretical framework to remove this projection effect, and we use it to show that all the data, from small solar neighborhood clouds with masses \~{}10$^{3}$ M $_{⊙}$ to submillimeter galaxies with masses \~{}10$^{11}$ M $_{⊙}$, fall on a single star formation law in which the star formation rate is simply \~{}1\% of the molecular gas mass per local free-fall time. In contrast, proposed star formation laws in which the star formation timescale is set by the galactic rotation period are inconsistent with the data from the Milky Way and the Local Group, while those in which the star formation rate is linearly proportional to the gas mass above some density threshold fail both in the Local Group and for starburst galaxies.},

  abstract      = {We investigate the star formation-feedback cycle in cosmological galaxy formation simulations, focusing on the progenitors of Milky Way (MW)-sized galaxies. We find that in order to reproduce key properties of the MW progenitors, such as semi-empirically derived star formation histories (SFHs) and the shape of rotation curves, our implementation of star formation and stellar feedback requires (1) a combination of local early momentum feedback via radiation pressure and stellar winds, and subsequent efficient supernovae feedback, and (2) an efficacy of feedback that results in the self-regulation of the global star formation rate on kiloparsec scales. We show that such feedback-driven self-regulation is achieved globally for a local star formation efficiency per free fall time of $\{$$\{${$\epsilon$} $\}$$_{ff}$$\}${\ap} 10\%. Although this value is larger that the $\{$$\{${$\epsilon$} $\}$$_{ff}$$\}${\tilde} 1\% value usually inferred from the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, we show that it is consistent with direct observational estimates of $\{$$\{${$\epsilon$} $\}$$_{ff}$$\}$ in molecular clouds. Moreover, we show that simulations with local efficiency of $\{$$\{${$\epsilon$} $\}$$_{ff}$$\}${\ap} 10\% reproduce the global observed KS relation. Such simulations also reproduce the cosmic SFH of the MW-sized galaxies and satisfy a number of other observational constraints. Conversely, we find that simulations that a priori assume an inefficient mode of star formation, instead of achieving it via stellar feedback regulation, fail to produce sufficiently vigorous outflows and do not reproduce observations. This illustrates the importance of understanding the complex interplay between star formation and feedback, and the detailed processes that contribute to the feedback-regulated formation of galaxies.},

  abstract      = {Low-mass “dwarf” galaxies represent the most significant challenges to the cold dark matter (CDM) model of cosmological structure formation. Because these faint galaxies are (best) observed within the Local Group (LG) of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31), understanding their formation in such an environment is critical. We present first results from the Latte Project: the Milky Way on Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE). This simulation models the formation of an MW-mass galaxy to z=0 within ΛCDM cosmology, including dark matter, gas, and stars at unprecedented resolution: baryon particle mass of 7070 {M}⊙ with gas kernel/softening that adapts down to 1 {pc} (with a median of 25{--}60 {pc} at z=0). Latte was simulated using the GIZMO code with a mesh-free method for accurate hydrodynamics and the FIRE-2 model for star formation and explicit feedback within a multi-phase interstellar medium. For the first time, Latte self-consistently resolves the spatial scales corresponding to half-light radii of dwarf galaxies that form around an MW-mass host down to {M}{star}≳ {10}5 {M}⊙ . Latte’s population of dwarf galaxies agrees with the LG across a broad range of properties: (1) distributions of stellar masses and stellar velocity dispersions (dynamical masses), including their joint relation; (2) the mass-metallicity relation; and (3) diverse range of star formation histories, including their mass dependence. Thus, Latte produces a realistic population of dwarf galaxies at {M}{star}≳ {10}5 {M}⊙ that does not suffer from the “missing satellites” or “too big to fail” problems of small-scale structure formation. We conclude that baryonic physics can reconcile observed dwarf galaxies with standard ΛCDM cosmology. },

These simulations are part of the Feedback in Realistic Environments (fire) project and are performed at extremely high resolution (m$_{baryon}$ = 500 M$_{⊙}$, m$_{dm}$ = 2500 M$_{⊙}$). The resultant galaxies have stellar masses that are consistent with rough abundance matching estimates, coinciding with the faintest galaxies that can be seen beyond the virial radius of the Milky Way (M$_{*}$/M$_{⊙}$ {\ap} 10$^{5}$ - 10$^{7}$). This non-negligible spread in stellar mass at z = 0 in haloes within a narrow range of virial masses is strongly correlated with central halo density or maximum circular velocity V$_{max}$, both of which are tightly linked to halo formation time. Much of this dependence of M$_{*}$ on a second parameter (beyond M$_{halo}$) is a direct consequence of the M$_{halo}$ {\tilde} 10$^{10}$ M$_{⊙}$ mass scale coinciding with the threshold for strong reionization suppression: the densest, earliest-forming haloes remain above the UV-suppression scale throughout their histories while late-forming systems fall below the UV-suppression scale over longer periods and form fewer stars as a result. In fact, the latest-forming, lowest-concentration halo in our suite fails to form any stars. Haloes that form galaxies with M$_{⋆}$ {\gsim} 2 {\times} 10$^{6}$ M$_{⊙}$ have reduced central densities relative to dark-matter-only simulations, and the radial extent of the density modifications is well-approximated by the galaxy half-mass radius r$_{1/2}$. Lower-mass galaxies do not modify their host dark matter haloes at the mass scale studied here. This apparent stellar mass threshold of M$_{⋆}$ {\ap} 2 {\times} 10$^{6}$ - 2 {\times} 10$^{- 4}$ M$_{halo}$ is broadly consistent with previous work and provides a testable prediction of fire feedback models in {$\Lambda$}cold dark matter.},

  abstract      = {The star formation histories (SFHs) of dwarf galaxies are thought to be bursty, with large - order of magnitude - changes in the star formation rate on time-scales similar to O-star lifetimes. As a result, the standard interpretations of many galaxy observables (which assume a slowly varying SFH) are often incorrect. Here, we use the SFHs from hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the effects of bursty SFHs on sample selection and interpretation of observables and make predictions to confirm such SFHs in future surveys. First, because dwarf galaxies' star formation rates change rapidly, the mass-to-light ratio is also changing rapidly in both the ionizing continuum and, to a lesser extent, the non-ionizing ultraviolet continuum. Therefore, flux limited surveys are highly biased towards selecting galaxies in the burst phase and very deep observations are required to detect all dwarf galaxies at a given stellar mass. Second, we show that a log$_{10}$[{$\nu$}L$_{ν}$(1500 {\AA})/L$_{Hα}$] $\gt$ 2.5 implies a very recent quenching of star formation and can be used as evidence of stellar feedback regulating star formation. Third, we show that the ionizing continuum can be significantly higher than when assuming a constant SFH, which can affect the interpretation of nebular emission line equivalent widths and direct ionizing continuum detections. Finally, we show that a star formation rate estimate based on continuum measurements only (and not on nebular tracers such as the hydrogen Balmer lines) will not trace the rapid changes in star formation and will give the false impression of a star-forming main sequence with low dispersion.},

  abstract      = {The presence of a dark matter core in the central kiloparsec of many dwarf galaxies has been a long-standing problem in galaxy formation theories based on the standard cold dark matter paradigm. Recent simulations, based on smooth particle hydrodynamics and rather strong feedback recipes, have shown that it was indeed possible to form extended dark matter cores using baryonic processes related to a more realistic treatment of the interstellar medium. Using adaptive mesh refinement, together with a new, stronger supernova feedback scheme that we have recently implemented in the RAMSES code, we show that it is also possible to form a prominent dark matter core within the well-controlled framework of an isolated, initially cuspy, 10$^{10}$ M$_{⊙}$ dark matter halo. Although our numerical experiment is idealized, it allows a clean and unambiguous identification of the dark matter core formation process. Our dark matter inner profile is well fitted by a pseudo-isothermal profile with a core radius of 800 pc. The core formation mechanism is consistent with the one proposed by Pontzen {\amp} Governato. We highlight two key observational predictions of all simulations that find cusp-core transformations: (i) a bursty star formation history with a peak-to-trough ratio of 5 to 10 and a duty cycle comparable to the local dynamical time and (ii) a stellar distribution that is hot with v/{$\sigma$} {\tilde} 1. We compare the observational properties of our model galaxy with recent measurements of the isolated dwarf Wolf-Lundmark-Mellote (WLM). We show that the spatial and kinematical distribution of stars and H I gas are in striking agreement with observations, supporting the fundamental role played by stellar feedback in shaping both the stellar and dark matter distribution.},

  abstract      = {We use a suite of 31 simulated galaxies drawn from the MaGICC project to investigate the effects of baryonic feedback on the density profiles of dark matter haloes. The sample covers a wide mass range: 9.4 {\times} 10$^{9}$ $\lt$ M$_{halo}$/ M$_{⊙}$ $\lt$ 7.8 {\times} 10$^{11}$, hosting galaxies with stellar masses in the range 5.0 {\times} 10$^{5}$ $\lt$ M$_{*}$/ M$_{⊙}$ $\lt$ 8.3 {\times} 10$^{10}$, i.e. from dwarf to L*. The galaxies are simulated with blastwave supernova feedback and, for some of them, an additional source of energy from massive stars is included. Within this feedback scheme we vary several parameters, such as the initial mass function, the density threshold for star formation, and energy from supernovae and massive stars. The main result is a clear dependence of the inner slope of the dark matter density profile, {$\alpha$} in {$\rho$} {\prop} r$^{α}$, on the stellar-to-halo mass ratio, M$_{*}$/M$_{halo}$. This relation is independent of the particular choice of parameters within our stellar feedback scheme, allowing a prediction for cusp versus core formation. When M$_{*}$/M$_{halo}$ is low, {\lsim}0.01 per cent, energy from stellar feedback is insufficient to significantly alter the inner dark matter density, and the galaxy retains a cuspy profile. At higher stellar-to-halo mass ratios, feedback drives the expansion of the dark matter and generates cored profiles. The flattest profiles form where M$_{*}$/M$_{halo}$ {\tilde} 0.5 per cent. Above this ratio, stars formed in the central regions deepen the gravitational potential enough to oppose the supernova-driven expansion process, resulting in cuspier profiles. Combining the dependence of {$\alpha$} on M$_{*}$/M$_{halo}$ with the empirical abundance matching relation between M$_{*}$ and M$_{halo}$ provides a prediction for how {$\alpha$} varies as a function of stellar mass. Further, using the Tully-Fisher relation allows a prediction for the dependence of the dark matter inner slope on the observed rotation velocity of galaxies. The most cored galaxies are expected to have V$_{rot}$ {\tilde} 50 km s$^{-1}$, with {$\alpha$} decreasing for more massive disc galaxies: spirals with V$_{rot}$ {\tilde} 150 km s$^{-1}$ have central slopes {$\alpha$} {\le} -0.8, approaching again the Navarro-Frenk-White profile. This novel prediction for the dependence of {$\alpha$} on disc galaxy mass can be tested using observational data sets and can be applied to theoretical modelling of mass profiles and populations of disc galaxies.},

  abstract      = {The Local Group galaxies offer some of the most discriminating tests of models of cosmic structure formation. For example, observations of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda satellite populations appear to be in disagreement with N-body simulations of the `lambda cold dark matter' ({$\Lambda$}CDM) model: there are far fewer satellite galaxies than substructures in CDM haloes (the `missing satellites' problem); dwarf galaxies seem to avoid the most massive substructures (the `too-big-to-fail' problem); and the brightest satellites appear to orbit their host galaxies on a thin plane (the `planes of satellites' problem). Here we present results from APOSTLE (A Project Of Simulating The Local Environment), a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of 12 volumes selected to match the kinematics of the Local Group (LG) members. Applying the EAGLE code to the LG environment, we find that our simulations match the observed abundance of LG galaxies, including the satellite galaxies of the MW and Andromeda. Due to changes to the structure of haloes and the evolution in the LG environment, the simulations reproduce the observed relation between stellar mass and velocity dispersion of individual dwarf spheroidal galaxies without necessitating the formation of cores in their dark matter profiles. Satellite systems form with a range of spatial anisotropies, including one similar to the MWs, confirming that such a configuration is not unexpected in {$\Lambda$}CDM. Finally, based on the observed velocity dispersion, size, and stellar mass, we provide estimates of the maximum circular velocity for the haloes of nine MW dwarf spheroidals.},

  abstract      = {Massive black holes (BHs) inhabit local galaxies, including the Milky Way and some dwarf galaxies. BH formation, occurring at early cosmic times, must account for the properties of BHs in today's galaxies, notably why some galaxies host a BH, and others do not. We investigate the formation, distribution and growth of BH 'seeds' by using the adaptive mesh refinement code ramses. We develop an implementation of BH formation in dense, low-metallicity environments, as advocated by models invoking the collapse of the first generation of stars, or of dense nuclear star clusters. The seed masses are computed one-by-one on-the-fly, based on the star formation rate and the stellar initial mass function. This self-consistent method to seed BHs allows us to study the distribution of BHs in a cosmological context and their evolution over cosmic time. We find that all high-mass galaxies tend to host a BH, whereas low-mass counterparts have a lower probability of hosting a BH. After the end of the epoch of BH formation, this probability is modulated by the growth of the galaxy. The simulated BHs connect to low-redshift observational samples, and span a similar range in accretion properties as Lyman-break analogs. The growth of BHs in low-mass galaxies is stunted by strong supernova (SN) feedback. The properties of BHs in dwarf galaxies thus remain a testbed for BH formation. Simulations with strong SN feedback, which is able to quench BH accretion in shallow potential wells, produce galaxies and BHs in better agreement with observational constraints.},

  abstract      = {The gas is the dominant component of baryonic matter in most galaxy groups and clusters. The spatial offsets of gas centre from the halo centre could be an indicator of the dynamical state of cluster. Knowledge of such offsets is important for estimate the uncertainties when using clusters as cosmological probes. In this paper, we study the centre offsets $r\_{\rm off}$ between the gas and that of all the matter within halo systems in $\Lambda$CDM cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We focus on two kinds of centre offsets: one is the three-dimensional PB offsets between the gravitational potential minimum of the entire halo and the barycentre of the ICM, and the other is the two-dimensional PX offsets between the potential minimum of the halo and the iterative centroid of the projected synthetic X-ray emission of the halo. Halos at higher redshifts tend to have larger values of rescaled offsets $r\_{\rm off}/r\_{200}$ and larger gas velocity dispersion $\sigma\_{v}^{\rm gas}/\sigma\_{200}$. For both types of offsets, we find that the correlation between the rescaled centre offsets $r\_{\rm off}/r\_{200}$ and the rescaled 3D gas velocity dispersion, $\sigma\_v^{\rm gas}/\sigma\_{200}$ can be approximately described by a quadratic function as $r\_{{\rm off}}/r\_{200} \propto (\sigma\_{v}^{\rm gas}/\sigma\_{200} - k\_2)^{2}$. A Bayesian analysis with MCMC method is employed to estimate the model parameters. Dependence of the correlation relation on redshifts and the gas mass fraction are also investigated.},

  abstract    = {Most detected neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) at low redshift is associated with optically bright galaxies. However, a handful of HI clouds are known which appear to be optically dark and have no nearby potential progenitor galaxies, making tidal debris an unlikely explanation. In particular, 6 clouds identified by the Arecibo Galaxy Environment Survey are interesting due to the combination of their small size, isolation, and especially their broad line widths atypical of other such clouds. A recent suggestion is that these clouds exist in pressure equilibrium with the intracluster medium, with the line width arising from turbulent internal motions. Here we explore that possibility by using the FLASH code to perform a series of 3D hydro simulations. Our clouds are modelled using spherical Gaussian density profiles, embedded in a hot, low-density gas representing the intracluster medium. The simulations account for heating and cooling of the gas, and we vary the structure and strength of their internal motions. We create synthetic HI spectra, and find that none of our simulations reproduce the observed cloud parameters for longer than about 100 Myr : the clouds either collapse, disperse, or experience rapid heating which would cause ionisation and render them undetectable to HI surveys. While the turbulent motions required to explain the high line widths generate structures which appear to be inherently unstable, making this an unlikely explanation for the observed clouds, these simulations demonstrate the importance of including the intracluster medium in any model seeking to explain the existence of these objects.},

  abstract    = {The Hubble sequence provides a useful classification of galaxy morphology at low redshift. However, morphologies are not static, but rather evolve as the growth of structure proceeds through mergers, accretion and secular processes. We investigate how kinematically defined disc and spheroidal structures form and evolve in the EAGLE hydrodynamic simulation of galaxy formation. At high redshift most galaxies of all masses are asymmetric. By redshift $z\simeq 1.5$ the Hubble sequence is established and after this time most of the stellar mass is in spheroids whose contribution to the stellar mass budget continues to rise to the present day. The stellar mass fraction in discs peaks at $z\simeq 0.5$ but overall remains subdominant at all times although discs contribute most of the stellar mass in systems of mass $M^*\sim 10^{10.5}{\rm M_\odot}$ at $z \leq 1.5$. Star formation occurs predominantly in disc structures throughout most of cosmic time but morphological transformations rearrange stars, thus establishing the low-redshift morphological mix. Morphological transformations are common and we quantify the rates at which they occur. The rate of growth of spheroids decreases at $z < 2$ while the rate of decay of discs remains roughly constant at $z < 1$. Finally, we find that the prograde component of galaxies becomes increasingly dynamically cold with time.},

  abstract    = {The EAGLE simulation suite has previously been used to investigate the relationship between the stellar mass of galaxies, $M_{*}$, and the properties of dark matter halos, using the hydrodynamical reference simulation combined with a dark matter only (DMO) simulation having identical initial conditions. The stellar masses of central galaxies in halos with $M_{\mathrm{200c}} > 10^{11} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ were shown to correlate with the DMO halo maximum circular velocity, with $\approx 0.2$ dex of scatter that is uncorrelated with other DMO halo properties. Here we revisit the origin of the scatter in the $M_{*}-V_{\mathrm{max, DMO}}$ relation in EAGLE at $z = 0.1$. We find that the scatter in $M_{*}$ correlates with the mean age of the galaxy stellar population such that more massive galaxies at fixed $V_{\mathrm{max, DMO}}$ are younger. The scatter in the stellar mass and mean stellar population age results from variation in the baryonic mass, $M_{\mathrm{bary}} = M_{\mathrm{gas}} + M_{*}$, of the galaxies' progenitors at fixed halo mass and concentration. At the redshift of peak correlation ($z \approx 1$), the progenitor baryonic mass accounts for $76\%$ of the variance in the $z=0.1$ $M_{*}-V_{\mathrm{max, DMO}}$ relation. The scatter in the baryonic mass, in turn, is primarily set by differences in feedback strength and gas accretion over the course of the evolution of each halo.},

RomulusC, a zoom-in simulation of a halo with $z=0$ mass $10^{14}$ M$\_{\odot}$, is run with the same sub-grid physics and resolution as Romulus25 (Tremmel et al. 2017). With unprecedented mass and spatial resolution, RomulusC represents a unique opportunity to study the evolution of galaxies in dense environments down to dwarf masses. We demonstrate that RomulusC results in an intracluster medium (ICM) consistent with observations. The star formation history and stellar mass of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) is consistent with observations and abundance matching results, demonstrating that our sub-grid models, optimized only to reproduce observations of field dwarf and Milky Way mass galaxies, are able to correctly predict galaxy masses and star formation histories at much higher masses. Feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) regulates star formation by driving large-scale, collimated outflows that coexist with a low entropy core. We find that non-BCG cluster member galaxies are substantially quenched compared to the field down to dwarf galaxy masses and, at low masses, quenching is seen to have no dependence on mass or distance from cluster center. This enhanced quenched population extends beyond $R\_{200}$ and is in place at high redshift. Similarly, we predict that SMBH activity is significantly suppressed within clusters outside of the BCG, but show how the effect could be lost when only focusing on the brightest AGN in the most massive galaxies.},

  abstract      = {We study the effects of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) on the cold streams that feed high-redshift galaxies through their hot haloes, generalizing our earlier analyses of a 2D slab to a 3D cylinder. Our analysis combines analytic modeling and numerical simulations in the linear and non-linear regimes. For streams that are subsonic or transonic with respect to the halo sound speed, the instability in 3D is qualitatively similar to that in 2D, except that it progresses at a faster pace. For supersonic streams, the instability grows much faster in 3D and it can be qualitatively different due to 3D azimuthal modes, which introduce a strong dependence on the initial width of the transition region between the stream and the background. Overall, the upper limit for the radius of a stream that disintegrates prior to reaching the central galaxy is larger by 70\% than the 2D estimate; it is in the range 0.5-5\% of the halo virial radius, decreasing with increasing stream density and velocity. Stream disruption generates a turbulent mixing zone around the stream with velocities at the level of 40\% of the initial stream velocity. Contrary to the 2D estimates, we find that in 3D the KHI can lead to significant stream deceleration and energy dissipation. For typical streams, 30-70\% of the gravitational energy gained by the inflow down the dark-matter halo potential well can be dissipated, capable of powering Lyman-alpha blobs.},

  abstract      = {We use the sky-average spectrum measured by EDGES High-Band ($90-190$ MHz) to constrain parameters of early galaxies independent of the absorption feature at $78$\~{}MHz reported by Bowman et al. (2018). These parameters represent traditional models of cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionization produced with the 21cmFAST simulation code (Mesinger {\amp} Furlanetto 2007, Mesinger et al. 2011). The parameters considered are: (1) the UV ionizing efficiency ($\zeta$), (2) minimum halo virial temperature hosting efficient star-forming galaxies ($T^{\rm min}\_{\rm vir}$), (3) integrated soft-band X-ray luminosity ($L\_{\rm X\,\lt\,2\,keV}/{\rm SFR}$), and (4) minimum X-ray energy escaping the first galaxies ($E\_{0}$), corresponding to a typical H${\rm \scriptstyle I}$ column density for attenuation through the interstellar medium. The High-Band spectrum disfavors high values of $T^{\rm min}\_{\rm vir}$ and $\zeta$, which correspond to signals with late absorption troughs and sharp reionization transitions. It also disfavors intermediate values of $L\_{\rm X\,\lt\,2\,keV}/{\rm SFR}$, which produce relatively deep and narrow troughs within the band. Specifically, we rule out $39.4\lt\log\_{10}\left(L\_{\rm X\,\lt\,2\,keV}/{\rm SFR}\right)\lt39.8$ ($95\\%$ C.L.). We then combine the EDGES High-Band data with constraints on the electron scattering optical depth from Planck and the hydrogen neutral fraction from high-$z$ quasars. This produces a lower degeneracy between $\zeta$ and $T^{\rm min}\_{\rm vir}$ than that reported in Greig {\amp} Mesinger (2017a) using the Planck and quasar constraints alone. Our main result in this combined analysis is the estimate $4.5$\~{}$\leq \log\_{10}\left(T^{\rm min}\_{\rm vir}/\rm K\right)\leq$\~{}$5.7$ ($95\\%$ C.L.). We leave for future work the evaluation of $21$\~{}cm models using simultaneously data from EDGES Low- and High-Band.},

  abstract      = {Through a suite of direct N-body simulations, we explore how the structural and kinematic evolution of a star cluster located at the center of a dwarf galaxy is affected by the shape of its host's dark matter density profile. The stronger central tidal fields of cuspier halos minimize the cluster's ability to expand in response to mass loss due to stellar evolution during its early evolutionary stages and during its subsequent long-term evolution driven by two-body relaxation. Hence clusters evolving in cuspier dark matter halos are characterized by more compact sizes, higher velocity dispersions and remain approximately isotropic at all clustercentric distances. Conversely, clusters in cored halos can expand more and develop a velocity distribution profile that becomes increasingly radially anisotropic at larger clustercentric distances. Finally, the larger velocity dispersion of clusters evolving in cuspier dark matter profiles results in them having longer relaxation times. Hence clusters in cuspy galaxies relax at a slower rate and, consequently, they are both less mass segregated and farther from complete energy equipartition than cluster's in cored galaxies. Application of this work to observations allows for star clusters to be used as tools to measure the distribution of dark matter in dwarf galaxies and to distinguish isolated star clusters from ultra-faint dwarf galaxies.},

  abstract      = {Building upon results of cosmological simulations of ultra-light scalar field dark matter (SFDM), we present a comprehensive model for the density profiles of SFDM haloes as a function of halo virial mass $M\_{\rm h}$ and scalar field mass $m$. The central regions of SFDM haloes are dominated by solitons with characteristic densities that increase with increasing halo mass and asymptote to CDM-like profiles at large radii. For scalar field masses $m \sim 10^{-22}$ eV, consistent with large-scale structure observations, $M\_{\rm h} \sim 10^{10} \,M\_\odot$ haloes have lower core densities than their Cold Dark Matter (CDM) counterparts and this alleviates the Too Big to Fail problem (TBTF) in a regime where feedback is less effective. However, higher-mass SFDM haloes with $M\_{\rm h} \sim 10^{11} \,M\_\odot$ are denser than their CDM counterparts at small, observationally relevant radii. We use rotation curves of $V \sim 100$ km s$^{-1}$ galaxies from the SPARC database to show that SFDM exacerbates the cusp/core and central density problems seen in CDM at this scale. We conclude that if the conventional cosmological SFDM scaling relations are correct, then baryonic feedback is required to lower densities in SFDM haloes even more so than in CDM. This motivates cosmological and self-consistent hydrodynamic simulations of SFDM to determine whether central soliton structure can be altered by realistic feedback implementations.},

  abstract      = {We study the chaotic-like behavior of cosmological simulations by quantifying how minute perturbations grow over time and manifest as macroscopic differences in galaxy properties. When we run the same setup multiple times, the results produced by our code, Arepo, are binary identical. However, when we run pairs of 'shadow' simulations that are identical except for random minute initial displacements to particle positions (e.g. of order 10\^{}-7pc), the results diverge from each other at the individual galaxy level (while the statistical properties of the ensemble of galaxies are unchanged). After cosmological times, the global properties of pairs of 'shadow' galaxies that are matched between the simulations differ from each other generally at a level of \~{}2-25\%, depending on the considered physical quantity. We perform these experiments using cosmological volumes of (25-50Mpc/h)\^{}3 evolved either purely with dark matter, or with baryons and star-formation but no feedback, or using the full feedback model of the IllustrisTNG project. The runs cover four resolution levels spanning a factor of 512 in mass. We find that without feedback the differences between shadow galaxies generally become smaller as the resolution increases, but with the IllustrisTNG model the results are mostly converging towards a 'floor'. This hints at the role of feedback in setting the chaotic properties of galaxy formation. Importantly, we compare the macroscopic differences between shadow galaxies to the overall scatter in various galaxy scaling relations, and conclude that for the star formation-mass and the Tully-Fisher relations the chaotic behavior of our simulations contributes significantly to the overall scatter. We discuss the implications for galaxy formation theory in general and for cosmological simulations in particular.},

For the first time in galaxy scale simulations, we simulate detailed stellar feedback from individual stars including asymptotic giant branch winds, photoelectric heating, Lyman-Werner radiation, ionizing radiation tracked through an adaptive ray-tracing radiative transfer method, and core collapse and Type Ia supernovae. We furthermore follow the star-by-star chemical yields using tracer fields for 15 metal species: C, N, O, Na, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Mn, Fe, Ni, As, Sr, Y, and Ba. We include the yields ejected in massive stellar winds, but greatly reduce the winds' velocities due to computational constraints. We describe these methods in detail in this work and present the first results from 500 Myr of evolution of an isolated dwarf galaxy with properties similar to a Local Group, low-mass dwarf galaxy. We demonstrate that our physics and feedback model is capable of producing a dwarf galaxy whose evolution is consistent with observations in both the Kennicutt-Schmidt relationship and extended Schmidt relationship. Effective feedback drives outflows with a greater metallicity than the ISM, leading to low metal retention fractions consistent with observations. Finally, we demonstrate that these simulations yield valuable information on the variation in mixing behavior of individual metal species within the multi-phase interstellar medium.},

We compare these findings with our new cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations based on the EAGLE model that self-consistently vary the IMF on a per-particle basis such that it becomes either bottom-heavy (LoM-50) or top-heavy (HiM-50) in high-pressure environments. These simulations were calibrated to reproduce inferred IMF variations such that the IMF becomes "heavier" due to either excess dwarf stars or stellar remnants, respectively, in galaxies with increasing stellar velocity dispersion. In agreement with observations, both simulations produce negative radial IMF gradients, transitioning from high to low excess mass-to-light ratio (MLE) at around $r_e$. We find negative metallicity radial gradients for both simulations, but positive and flat [Mg/Fe] gradients in LoM-50 and HiM-50, respectively. Measured in radial bins, the MLE increases strongly with local metallicity for both simulations, in agreement with observations. However, the local MLE increases and decreases with local [Mg/Fe] in LoM-50 and HiM-50, respectively. These qualitative differences can be used to break degeneracies in the manner with which the IMF varies in these high-mass ETGs. At $z=2$, we find that the MLE has a higher and lower normalization for bottom- and top-heavy IMF variations, respectively. We speculate that a hybrid of our LoM and HiM models may be able to reconcile observed IMF diagnostics in star-forming galaxies and ETGs.},

Even within the star-forming `main sequence', the measured sSFR decreases with stellar mass, in both an integrated and spatially resolved sense. Flat sSFR radial profiles are observed for log(M$_{⋆}$/M$_{⊙}$) $\lt$ 10.5, while star-forming galaxies of higher mass show a significant decrease in sSFR in the central regions, a likely consequence of both larger bulges and an inside-out growth history. Our primary focus is the green valley, constituted by galaxies lying below the star formation main sequence, but not fully passive. In the green valley we find sSFR profiles that are suppressed with respect to star-forming galaxies of the same mass at all galactocentric distances out to 2 effective radii. The responsible quenching mechanism therefore appears to affect the entire galaxy, not simply an expanding central region. The majority of green valley galaxies of log(M$_{⋆}$/M$_{⊙}$) $\gt$ 10.0 are classified spectroscopically as central low-ionization emission-line regions (cLIERs). Despite displaying a higher central stellar mass concentration, the sSFR suppression observed in cLIER galaxies is not simply due to the larger mass of the bulge. Drawing a comparison sample of star-forming galaxies with the same M$_{⋆}$ and {$\Sigma$} \_$\{$1 kpc$\}$ (the mass surface density within 1 kpc), we show that a high {$\Sigma$} \_$\{$1 kpc$\}$ is not a sufficient condition for determining central quiescence.},

  abstract      = {The Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project explores feedback in cosmological galaxy formation simulations. Previous FIRE simulations used an identical source code (`FIRE-1') for consistency. Motivated by the development of more accurate numerics - including hydrodynamic solvers, gravitational softening, and supernova coupling algorithms - and exploration of new physics (e.g. magnetic fields), we introduce `FIRE-2', an updated numerical implementation of FIRE physics for the GIZMO code. We run a suite of simulations and compare against FIRE-1: overall, FIRE-2 improvements do not qualitatively change galaxy-scale properties. We pursue an extensive study of numerics versus physics. Details of the star formation algorithm, cooling physics, and chemistry have weak effects provided that we include metal-line cooling and star formation occurs at higher-than-mean densities. We present new resolution criteria for high-resolution galaxy simulations. Most galaxy-scale properties are robust to numerics we test, provided: (1) Toomre masses are resolved; (2) feedback coupling ensures conservation, and (3) individual supernovae are time-resolved. Stellar masses and profiles are most robust to resolution, followed by metal abundances and morphologies, followed by properties of winds and circum-galactic media. Central ({\tilde}kpc) mass concentrations in massive ($\gt$L$_{*}$) galaxies are sensitive to numerics (via trapping/recycling of winds in hot haloes). Multiple feedback mechanisms play key roles: supernovae regulate stellar masses/winds; stellar mass-loss fuels late star formation; radiative feedback suppresses accretion on to dwarfs and instantaneous star formation in discs. We provide all initial conditions and numerical algorithms used.},

We demonstrate that comparisons of the short-time-scale variability in galaxy SFRs with observational data provide an additional useful constraint on the physics of galaxy formation feedback. We apply SFR indicators with different sensitivity time-scales to galaxies from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations. We find that the SFR-M$_{*}$ relation has a significantly greater scatter when the H{$\alpha$}-derived SFR is considered compared with when the far-ultraviolet (FUV)-based SFR is used. This difference is a direct consequence of bursty star formation because the FIRE galaxies exhibit order-of-magnitude SFR variations over time-scales of a few Myr. We show that the difference in the scatter between the simulated H{$\alpha$}- and FUV-derived SFR-M$_{*}$ relations at z = 2 is consistent with observational constraints. We also find that the H{$\alpha$}/FUV ratios predicted by the simulations at z = 0 are similar to those observed for local galaxies except for a population of low-mass (M$_{*}$ {\lsim} 10$^{9.5}$ M$_{⊙}$) simulated galaxies with lower H{$\alpha$}/FUV ratios than observed. We suggest that future cosmological simulations should compare the H{$\alpha$}/FUV ratios of their galaxies with observations to constrain the feedback models employed.},

We show that the KS relation emerges and is robustly maintained due to the effects of feedback on local scales regulating star-forming gas, independent of the particular small-scale star formation prescriptions employed. We demonstrate that the time-averaged KS relation is relatively independent of redshift and spatial averaging scale, and that the star formation rate surface density is weakly dependent on metallicity and inversely dependent on orbital dynamical time. At constant star formation rate surface density, the `cold and dense' gas surface density (gas with T $\lt$ 300 K and n $\gt$ 10 cm$^{-3}$, used as a proxy for the molecular gas surface density) of the simulated galaxies is {\tilde}0.5 dex less than observed at {\tilde}kpc scales. This discrepancy may arise from underestimates of the local column density at the particle-scale for the purposes of shielding in the simulations. Finally, we show that on scales larger than individual giant molecular clouds, the primary condition that determines whether star formation occurs is whether a patch of the galactic disc is thermally Toomre-unstable (not whether it is self-shielding): once a patch can no longer be thermally stabilized against fragmentation, it collapses, becomes self-shielding, cools, and forms stars, regardless of epoch or environment.},

We focus on galaxies with halo masses of 1e9$\lt$Mvir/Msol$\lt$1e11 at high redshift ($z\ge5$). We find that, with the modifications previously proposed in Qin et al. (2018), including to suppress the halo mass and baryon fraction, as well as to modulate gas cooling and star formation efficiencies, the SAM can reproduce the cosmic evolution of galaxy properties predicted by the hydrodynamic simulation. These include the galaxy stellar mass function, total baryonic mass, star-forming gas mass and star formation rate at $z\sim5-11$. However, this agreement is only possible by reducing the star formation threshold relative to that suggested by local observations. Otherwise, too much star-forming gas is trapped in quenched dwarf galaxies. We further find that dwarf galaxies rapidly build up their star-forming reservoirs in the early universe ($z\gt10$), with the relevant time-scale becoming significantly longer towards lower redshifts. This indicates efficient accretion in cold mode in these low-mass objects at high redshift. Note that the improved SAM, which has been calibrated against hydrodynamic simulations, can provide more accurate predictions of high-redshift dwarf galaxy properties that are essential for reionization study.},

  abstract      = {In this paper, we use two hydrodynamic simulations to study the barycentre offsets $r\_{{\rm off}}$ between the entire halo and the gas or dark matter subhalo with largest overdensity. We restrict our analysis to those halos with large rescaled offsets, i.e. $r\_{{\rm off}}/r\_{200}\gtrsim 0.05$. The halos which are less massive and at higher redshifts are more likely to have larger $r\_{{\rm off}}/r\_{200}$. The 3D velocity dispersion of the subhalos with largest overdensity is found to have a similar mass and redshift dependence as $r\_{{\rm off}}/r\_{200}$. We also find that the gas subhalos with maximum overdensity and larger gas velocity dispersion $\sigma\_{v}^{\rm ICM,sub}/\sigma\_{200}$ tend to have smaller barycentre offsets $r\_{{\rm off}}/r\_{200}$. Similar result is found for the highest overdensity dark matter subhalos but with less significance. This anti-correlation is more significant for the snapshot $z=0$ than $z=0.2$ and $0.5$. The underlying physical mechanism for this anti-correlation remains to be explored.},

  abstract      = {The circumgalactic medium (CGM), i.e. the gaseous haloes around galaxies, is both the reservoir of gas that fuels galaxy growth and the repository of gas expelled by galactic winds. Most cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations focus their computational effort on the galaxies themselves and treat the CGM more coarsely, which means small-scale structure cannot be resolved. We get around this issue by running zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way-mass galaxy with standard mass refinement and additional uniform spatial refinement within the virial radius. This results in a detailed view of its gaseous halo at unprecedented (1 kpc) uniform resolution with only a moderate increase in computational time. The improved spatial resolution does not impact the central galaxy or the average density of the CGM. However, it drastically changes the radial profile of the neutral hydrogen column density, which is enhanced at galactocentric radii larger than 40 kpc. The covering fraction of Lyman-Limit Systems within 150 kpc is almost doubled. We therefore conclude that some of the observational properties of the CGM are strongly resolution dependent. Increasing the resolution in the CGM, without increasing the resolution of the galaxies, is a promising and computationally efficient method to push the boundaries of state-of-the-art simulations.},

  abstract      = {It has long been regarded as difficult if not impossible for a cosmological model to account simultaneously for the galaxy luminosity, mass, and velocity distributions. We revisit this issue using a modern compilation of observational data along with the best available large-scale cosmological simulation of dark matter (DM). We find that the standard cosmological model, used in conjunction with halo abundance matching (HAM) and simple dynamical corrections, fits{\mdash}at least on average{\mdash}all basic statistics of galaxies with circular velocities V $_{circ}$ $\gt$ 80 km s$^{-1}$ calculated at a radius of \~{}10 kpc. Our primary observational constraint is the luminosity-velocity (LV) relation{\mdash}which generalizes the Tully-Fisher and Faber-Jackson relations in allowing all types of galaxies to be included, and provides a fundamental benchmark to be reproduced by any theory of galaxy formation. We have compiled data for a variety of galaxies ranging from dwarf irregulars to giant ellipticals. The data present a clear monotonic LV relation from \~{}50 km s$^{-1}$ to \~{}500 km s$^{-1}$, with a bend below \~{}80 km s$^{-1}$ and a systematic offset between late- and early-type galaxies. For comparison to theory, we employ our new {$\Lambda$}CDM ``Bolshoi'' simulation of DM, which has unprecedented mass and force resolution over a large cosmological volume, while using an up-to-date set of cosmological parameters. We use HAM to assign rank-ordered galaxy luminosities to the DM halos, a procedure that automatically fits the empirical luminosity function and provides a predicted LV relation that can be checked against observations. The adiabatic contraction of DM halos in response to the infall of the baryons is included as an optional model ingredient. The resulting predictions for the LV relation are in excellent agreement with the available data on both early-type and late-type galaxies for the luminosity range from M$_{r}$ = -14 to M$_{r}$ = -22. We also compare our predictions for the ``cold'' baryon mass (i.e., stars and cold gas) of galaxies as a function of circular velocity with the available observations, again finding a very good agreement. The predicted circular velocity function (VF) is also in agreement with the galaxy VF from 80 to 400 km s$^{-1}$, using the HIPASS survey for late-type galaxies and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) for early-type galaxies. However, in accord with other recent results, we find that the DM halos with V $_{circ}$ $\lt$ 80 km s$^{-1}$ are much more abundant than observed galaxies with the same V $_{circ}$. Finally, we find that the two-point correlation function of bright galaxies in our model matches very well the results from the final data release of the SDSS, especially when a small amount of scatter is included in the HAM prescription.},

  abstract      = {Lambda Cold Dark Matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) is now the standard theory of structure formation in the universe. We present the first results from the new Bolshoi dissipationless cosmological {$\Lambda$}CDM simulation that uses cosmological parameters favored by current observations. The Bolshoi simulation was run in a volume 250 h $^{-1}$ Mpc on a side using \~{}8 billion particles with mass and force resolution adequate to follow subhalos down to the completeness limit of V $_{circ}$ = 50 km s$^{-1}$ maximum circular velocity. Using merger trees derived from analysis of 180 stored time steps we find the circular velocities of satellites before they fall into their host halos. Using excellent statistics of halos and subhalos (\~{}10 million at every moment and \~{}50 million over the whole history) we present accurate approximations for statistics such as the halo mass function, the concentrations for distinct halos and subhalos, the abundance of halos as a function of their circular velocity, and the abundance and the spatial distribution of subhalos. We find that at high redshifts the concentration falls to a minimum value of about 4.0 and then rises for higher values of halo mass{\mdash}a new result. We present approximations for the velocity and mass functions of distinct halos as a function of redshift. We find that while the Sheth-Tormen (ST) approximation for the mass function of halos found by spherical overdensity is quite accurate at low redshifts, the ST formula overpredicts the abundance of halos by nearly an order of magnitude by z = 10. We find that the number of subhalos scales with the circular velocity of the host halo as V $^{1/2}$ $_{host}$, and that subhalos have nearly the same radial distribution as dark matter particles at radii 0.3-2 times the host halo virial radius. The subhalo velocity function N($\gt$ V $_{sub}$) scales as V $^{-3}$ $_{circ}$. Combining the results of Bolshoi and Via Lactea-II simulations, we find that inside the virial radius of halos with $\{$V\_circ$\}$=200 $\{$$\backslash$,km s\^{}$\{$-1$\}$$\}$ the number of satellites is N($\gt$ V $_{sub}$) = (V $_{sub}$/58 km s$^{-1}$)$^{-3}$ for satellite circular velocities in the range 4 km s$^{-1}$ $\lt$ V $_{sub}$ $\lt$ 150 km s$^{-1}$.},

This model, together with the theory of cosmic inflation, makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a simulation of the growth of dark matter structure using 2,160$^{3}$ particles, following them from redshift z = 127 to the present in a cube-shaped region 2.230 billion lightyears on a side. In postprocessing, we also follow the formation and evolution of the galaxies and quasars. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with future generations of observational surveys of galaxies.},

Cholla models the Euler equations on a static mesh using state-of-the-art techniques, including the unsplit Corner Transport Upwind algorithm, a variety of exact and approximate Riemann solvers, and multiple spatial reconstruction techniques including the piecewise parabolic method (PPM). Using GPUs, Cholla evolves the fluid properties of thousands of cells simultaneously and can update over 10 million cells per GPU-second while using an exact Riemann solver and PPM reconstruction. Owing to the massively parallel architecture of GPUs and the design of the Cholla code, astrophysical simulations with physically interesting grid resolutions ({\gsim}256$^{3}$) can easily be computed on a single device. We use the Message Passing Interface library to extend calculations onto multiple devices and demonstrate nearly ideal scaling beyond 64 GPUs. A suite of test problems highlights the physical accuracy of our modeling and provides a useful comparison to other codes. We then use Cholla to simulate the interaction of a shock wave with a gas cloud in the interstellar medium, showing that the evolution of the cloud is highly dependent on its density structure. We reconcile the computed mixing time of a turbulent cloud with a realistic density distribution destroyed by a strong shock with the existing analytic theory for spherical cloud destruction by describing the system in terms of its median gas density.},

If the Illustris simulation and the $\Lambda$CDM model are accurate, there are a significant number of dark matter deficient galaxies, including massive luminous compact ones.

We first compare BH properties, i.e. the hard X-ray BH luminosity function, AGN galaxy occupation fraction, and distribution of Eddington ratios, to available observational constraints. The simulations produce a population of BHs in good agreement with observations, but we note an excess of faint AGN in hard X-ray (L\_x \~{} 10\^{}$\{$43-44$\}$ erg/s), and a lower number of bright AGN (L\_x$\gt$10\^{}$\{$44$\}$ erg/s), a conclusion that varies quantitatively but not qualitatively with BH luminosity estimation method. The lower Eddington ratios of the 10\^{}$\{$9$\}$ Msun BHs compared to observations suggest that AGN feedback may be too efficient in this regime. We study galaxy star formation activity and structural properties, and design sample-dependent criteria to identify different galaxy types (star-forming/quiescent, extended/compact) that we apply both to the simulations and observations from the candels fields. We analyze how the simulated and observed galaxies populate the specific star formation rate - stellar mass surface density diagram. A large fraction of the z=0 M\_$\{$star$\}$$\gt$10\^{}$\{$11$\}$ Msun quiescent galaxies first experienced a compaction phase (i.e. reduction of galaxy size) while still forming stars, and then a quenching event. We measure the dependence of AGN fraction on galaxies' locations in this diagram. After correcting the simulations with a redshift and AGN luminosity-dependent model for AGN obscuration, we find good qualitative and quantitative agreement with observations. The AGN fraction is the highest among compact star-forming galaxies (16-20\% at z\~{}1.5-2), and the lowest among compact quiescent galaxies (6-10\% at z\~{}1.5-2).},
