  abstract      = {We examine the spheroid growth and star formation quenching experienced by galaxies since z {\tilde} 3 by studying the evolution with redshift of the quiescent and spheroid-dominated fractions of galaxies from the CANDELS (Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey) and GAMA (Galaxy and Mass Assembly) surveys. We compare the observed fractions with predictions from a semi-analytic model which includes prescriptions for bulge growth and AGN feedback due to mergers and disc instabilities. We facilitate direct morphological comparison by converting our model bulge-to-total stellar mass ratios to S{\'e}rsic indices. We then subdivide our population into the four quadrants of the specific star formation rate-S{\'e}rsic index plane and study the build-up of each of these subpopulations. We find that the fraction of star-forming discs declines steadily, while the fraction of quiescent spheroids builds up over cosmic time. The fractions of star-forming spheroids and quiescent discs are both non-negligible, and stay nearly constant over the period we have studied. Our model is qualitatively successful at reproducing the evolution of the two `main' populations (star-forming discs and quiescent spheroids), and approximately reproduces the relative fractions of all four types, but predicts a stronger decline in star-forming spheroids, and increase in quiescent discs, than is seen in the observations. A model with an additional channel for bulge growth via disc instabilities agrees better overall with the observations than a model in which bulges can grow only through mergers. We also examine the relative importance of these different physical drivers of transformation (major and minor mergers and disc instabilities).},

  abstract      = {We present Bayesian Analysis of Galaxies for Physical Inference and Parameter EStimation, or BAGPIPES, a new Python tool which can be used to rapidly generate complex model galaxy spectra and to fit these to arbitrary combinations of spectroscopic and photometric data using the MultiNest algorithm. We extensively test our ability to recover realistic star-formation histories (SFHs) with BAGPIPES by fitting mock observations of quiescent galaxies from the MUFASA simulation. We show that a double-power-law model produces better agreement with realistic SFHs than an exponentially-declining model. We then perform a detailed analysis of the SFHs of a sample of 9312 quiescent galaxies from UltraVISTA with stellar masses, $M\_* \gt 10^{10}\ \mathrm{M\_\odot}$ and redshifts $0.25 \lt z\_\mathrm{obs} \lt 3.75$. The majority of our quiescent sample exhibit SFHs which rise gradually then quench relatively rapidly, over $\sim 1{-}2$ Gyr. This behaviour is consistent with recent cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, where AGN-driven feedback in the low-accretion (jet) mode is the dominant quenching mechanism. In addition, we identify two further subsets of objects with distinct SFH shapes. At $z\_\mathrm{obs} \gtrsim 1$ we find a class of objects with SFHs which rise and fall very rapidly, with quenching timescales of $\lesssim 1$ Gyr. These objects are consistent with (potentially merger-triggered) quasar-mode AGN feedback. Also, at $z\_\mathrm{obs} \lesssim 1$ we find a population with SFHs which quench more slowly than they rise, over $\gtrsim3$ Gyr, which we speculate to be the result of a 'natural' quenching process, where galaxy SFHs die down gradually due to the diminishing overall cosmic gas supply. Purely passive evolution of the quiescent population at $z\_\mathrm{obs} \gtrsim 0.5$ is disfavoured by our results.},

In a stellar mass bin at 10 10.5 < M galaxy < 10 11 M ☉ , we see no change in the number density of compact Q-ETGs over this redshift range, while in a higher mass bin at >10 11 M ☉ , where we would expect merging to be more significant, we find a small decrease, by ~30%. In both mass bins, the increase of the median sizes of Q-ETGs with time is primarily caused by the addition to the size function of larger and more diffuse Q-ETGs. At all masses, compact Q-ETGs become systematically redder toward later epochs, with a ( U – V ) color difference which is consistent with a passive evolution of their stellar populations, indicating that they are a stable population that does not appreciably evolve in size. We find furthermore, at all epochs, that the larger Q-ETGs (at least in the lower mass bin) have average rest-frame colors that are systematically bluer than those of the more compact Q-ETGs, suggesting that the former are indeed younger than the latter. The idea that new, large, Q-ETGs are responsible for the observed growth in the median size of the population at a given mass is also supported by analysis of the sizes and number of the star-forming galaxies that are expected to be the progenitors of the new Q-ETGs over the same period. In the low mass bin, the new Q-ETGs appear to have ~30% smaller half-light radii than their star-forming progenitors. This is likely due to the fading of their disks after they cease star formation. Comparison with higher redshifts shows that the median size of newly quenched galaxies roughly scales, at constant mass, as (1 + z ) –1 . We conclude that the dominant cause of the size evolution seen in the Q-ETG population is that the average sizes and thus stellar densities of individual Q-ETGs roughly scale with the average density of the universe at the time when they were quenched, and that subsequent size changes in individual objects, through merging or other processes, are of secondary importance, especially at masses below 10 11 M ☉ .},

  abstract      = {In the local Universe, there is a strong division in the star-forming properties of low-mass galaxies, with star formation largely ubiquitous amongst the field population while satellite systems are predominantly quenched. This dichotomy implies that environmental processes play the dominant role in suppressing star formation within this low-mass regime (${M}\_{\star} \sim 10^{5.5-8}~{\rm M}\_{\odot}$). As shown by observations of the Local Volume, however, there is a non-negligible population of passive systems in the field, which challenges our understanding of quenching at low masses. By applying the satellite quenching models of Fillingham et al. (2015) to subhalo populations in the Exploring the Local Volume In Simulations (ELVIS) suite, we investigate the role of environmental processes in quenching star formation within the nearby field. Using model parameters that reproduce the satellite quenched fraction in the Local Group, we predict a quenched fraction -- due solely to environmental effects -- of $\sim 0.52 \pm 0.26$ within $1\lt R/R\_{\rm vir} \lt 2$ of the Milky Way and M31. This is in good agreement with current observations of the Local Volume and suggests that the majority of the passive field systems observed at these distances are quenched via environmental mechanisms. Beyond $2~R\_{\rm vir}$, however, dwarf galaxy quenching becomes difficult to explain through an interaction with either the Milky Way or M31, such that more isolated, field dwarfs may be self-quenched as a result of star-formation feedback.},

  abstract = {The star formation rates (SFRs) of low-metallicity galaxies depend sensitively on the gas metallicity, because metals are crucial to mediating the transition from intermediate-temperature atomic gas to cold molecular gas, a necessary precursor to star formation. We study the impact of this effect on the star formation history of galaxies. We incorporate metallicity-dependent star formation and metal enrichment in a simple model that follows the evolution of a halo main progenitor. Our model shows that including the effect of metallicity leads to suppression of star formation at redshift z > 2 in dark halos with masses ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 10 11 M ☉ , with the suppression becoming near total for halos below ~10 9.5 -10 10 M ☉ . We find that at high redshift, until z ~ 2, the SFR cannot catch up with the gas inflow rate (IR), because the SFR is limited by the free-fall time, and because it is suppressed further by a lack of metals in small halos. As a result, in each galaxy the SFR is growing in time faster than the IR, and the integrated cosmic SFR density is rising with time. The suppressed in situ SFR at high- z makes the growth of stellar mass dominated by ex situ SFR, meaning stars formed in lower mass progenitor galaxies and then accreted, which implies that the specific SFR (sSFR) remains constant with time. The intensely accreted gas at high- z is accumulating as an atomic gas reservoir. This provides additional fuel for star formation in 10 10 -10 12 M ☉ halos at z ~ 1-3, which allows the SFR to exceed the instantaneous IR, and may enable an even higher outflow rate. At z < 1, following the natural decline in IR with time due to the universal expansion, the SFR and sSFR are expected to drop. We specify the expected dependence of sSFR and metallicity on stellar mass and redshift. At a given z , and below a critical mass, these relations are predicted to be flat and rising, respectively. Our model predictions qualitatively match some of the puzzling features in the observed star formation history.},

  abstract      = {The average star formation rate (SFR) in galaxies has been declining since the redshift of 2. A fraction of galaxies quench and become quiescent. We constrain two key properties of the quenching process: the quenching timescale and the quenching rate among galaxies. We achieve this by analyzing the galaxy number density profile in NUV-u color space and the distribution in NUV-u versus u - I color-color diagram with a simple toy-model framework. We focus on galaxies in three mass bins between 10$^{10}$ and 10$^{10.6}$ M $_{⊙}$. In the NUV-u versus u - I color-color diagram, the red u - I galaxies exhibit a different slope from the slope traced by the star-forming galaxies. This angled distribution and the number density profile of galaxies in NUV-u space strongly suggest that the decline of the SFR in galaxies has to accelerate before they turn quiescent. We model this color-color distribution with a two-phase exponential decline star formation history. The models with an e-folding time in the second phase (the quenching phase) of 0.5 Gyr best fit the data. We further use the NUV-u number density profile to constrain the quenching rate among star-forming galaxies as a function of mass. Adopting an e-folding time of 0.5 Gyr in the second phase (or the quenching phase), we found the quenching rate to be 19\%/Gyr, 25\%/Gyr and 33\%/Gyr for the three mass bins. These are upper limits of the quenching rate as the transition zone could also be populated by rejuvenated red-sequence galaxies.},

After careful data reduction and stacking analysis, we conduct a radially resolved pixel spectral energy distribution fitting to obtain the radial distributions of the stellar mass and rest-frame colors.

A new approach to evaluate the morphological diversity is conducted by using the average surface density profile and its dispersion. The variety of the radial mass profiles for MGs peaks at higher redshift ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/805/1/34/apj510634ieqn9.gif] {$z\gt 2.8$} ) and then rapidly converges to a more uniform shape at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/805/1/34/apj510634ieqn10.gif] {$z\lt 1.5$} , while that for MWs remains in the outer region over the redshift.

We utilize a large sample of nearly 6000 groups, selected by fixed cumulative number density from three photometric catalogs, to follow the evolving quiescent fractions of central and satellite galaxies over roughly 11 Gyr. At z \~{} 0, central galaxies in our sample range in stellar mass from Milky Way/M31 analogs (M $_{sstarf}$/M $_{⊙}$ = 6.5 {\times} 10$^{10}$) to nearby massive ellipticals (M $_{sstarf}$/M $_{⊙}$ = 1.5 {\times} 10$^{11}$). Satellite galaxies in the same groups reach masses as low as twice that of the Large Magellanic Cloud (M $_{sstarf}$/M $_{⊙}$ = 6.5 {\times} 10$^{9}$). Using statistical background subtraction, we measure the average rest-frame colors of galaxies in our groups and calculate the evolving quiescent fractions of centrals and satellites over seven redshift bins. Our analysis shows clear evidence for star formation quenching in group halos, with a different quenching onset for centrals and their satellite galaxies. Using halo mass estimates for our central galaxies, we find that star formation shuts off in centrals when typical halo masses reach between 10$^{12}$ and 10$^{13}$ M $_{⊙}$, consistent with predictions from the halo quenching model. In contrast, satellite galaxies in the same groups most likely undergo quenching by environmental processes, whose onset is delayed with respect to their central galaxy. Although star formation is suppressed in all galaxies over time, the processes that govern quenching are different for centrals and satellites. While mass plays an important role in determining the star formation activity of central galaxies, quenching in satellite galaxies is dominated by the environment in which they reside.},

For each galaxy, we obtain two-dimensional maps and radial profiles for three spectroscopically measured parameters that are sensitive to the recent SFH: D$_{ n }$(4000) (the 4000 {\AA} break), EW(H{$\delta$} $_{ A }$), and EW(H{$\alpha$}) (the equivalent width of the H{$\delta$} absorption and the H{$\alpha$} emission line). The majority of the spaxels are consistent with models of a continuously declining star formation rate, indicating that starbursts occur rarely in local galaxies with regular morphologies. We classify the galaxies into three classes: fully star-forming (SF), partly quenched (PQ), and totally quenched (TQ). The galaxies that are less massive than 10$^{10}$ M $_{⊙}$ present at most weak radial gradients in the diagnostic parameters. In contrast, massive galaxies with a stellar mass above 10$^{10}$ M $_{⊙}$ present significant gradients in the three diagnostic parameters if they are classified as SF or PQ but show weak gradients in D$_{ n }$(4000) and EW(H{$\delta$} $_{ A }$) and no gradients in EW(H{$\alpha$}) if they are in the TQ class. This implies the existence of a critical stellar mass ({\sim}10$^{10}$ M $_{⊙}$) above which the star formation in a galaxy is shut down from the inside out. Galaxies tend to evolve synchronously from the inner to the outer regions before their mass reaches the critical value. We have further divided the sample at a fixed mass by both bulge-to-total luminosity ratio and morphological type, finding that our conclusions hold regardless of these factors; it appears that the presence of a central dense object is not a driving parameter but rather a by-product of the star formation cessation process.},

We explore the relationship between rest-frame optical color, stellar mass, star formation activity, and galaxy structure. We confirm the dramatic increase from z = 2.2 to the present day in the number density of non-star-forming galaxies above 3 × 10 10 M ☉ reported by others. We further find that the vast majority of these quiescent systems have concentrated light profiles, as parameterized by the Sérsic index, and the population of concentrated galaxies grows similarly rapidly. We examine the joint distribution of star formation activity, Sérsic index, stellar mass, inferred velocity dispersion, and stellar surface density. Quiescence correlates poorly with stellar mass at all z < 2.2. Quiescence correlates well with Sérsic index at all redshifts. Quiescence correlates well with "velocity dispersion" and stellar surface density at z > 1.3, and somewhat less well at lower redshifts. Yet, there is significant scatter between quiescence and galaxy structure: while the vast majority of quiescent galaxies have prominent bulges, many of them have significant disks, and a number of bulge-dominated galaxies have significant star formation. Noting the rarity of quiescent galaxies without prominent bulges, we argue that a prominent bulge (and perhaps, by association, a supermassive black hole) is an important condition for quenching star formation on galactic scales over the last 10 Gyr, in qualitative agreement with the active galactic nucleus feedback paradigm.},

  abstract = {We point out a natural mechanism for quenching of star formation in early-type galaxies (ETGs). It automatically links the color of a galaxy with its morphology and does not require gas consumption, removal or termination of gas supply. Given that star formation takes place in gravitationally unstable gas disks, it can be quenched when a disk becomes stable against fragmentation to bound clumps. This can result from the growth of a stellar spheroid, for instance by mergers. We present the concept of morphological quenching (MQ) using standard disk instability analysis, and demonstrate its natural occurrence in a cosmological simulation using an efficient zoom-in technique. We show that the transition from a stellar disk to a spheroid can be sufficient to stabilize the gas disk, quench star formation, and turn an ETG red and dead while gas accretion continues. The turbulence necessary for disk stability can be stirred up by sheared perturbations within the disk in the absence of bound star-forming clumps. While other quenching mechanisms, such as gas stripping, active galactic nucleus feedback, virial shock heating, and gravitational heating are limited to massive halos, MQ can explain the appearance of red ETGs also in halos less massive than ~10 12 M ☉ . The dense gas disks observed in some of today's red ellipticals may be the relics of this mechanism, whereas red galaxies with quenched gas disks could be more frequent at high redshift.},

We find that the dust-corrected u - r colors of early-type galaxies (ETGs) are flat out to R $_{90}$, while the colors monotonously turn blue when r $\gt$ 0.5 R $_{50}$ for late-type galaxies (LTGs). More than half of the ETGs are blue-cored and have remarkable positive NUV - r color gradients, suggesting that their star formations are centrally concentrated. The rest have flat color distributions out to R $_{90}$. The centrally concentrated star formation activity in a large portion of ETGs is confirmed by the SDSS spectroscopy, showing that \~{}50\% of the ETGs have EW(H{$\alpha$}) $\gt$6.0 {\AA}. Of the LTGs, 95\% show uniform radial color profiles, which can be interpreted as a red bulge plus an extended blue disk. The links between the two kinds of ETGs, e.g., those objects having remarkable ``blue-cores'' and those having flat color gradients, are less known and require future investigations. It is suggested that the LTGs follow a general model by which quenching first occurs in the core regions, and then finally extend to the rest of the galaxy. Our results can be re-examined and have important implications for the IFU surveys, such as MaNGA and SAMI.},

By splitting each galaxy into an inner and an outer part, we find that most galaxies show negative gradients in these two colours. We first rule out dust extinction gradient and metallicity gradient as the dominant source for the colour gradient. Then using stellar population models, we explore variations in SFH to explain the colour gradients. As shown by our earlier work, a two-phase SFH consisting of an early secular evolution (growth) phase and a subsequent rapid evolution (quenching) phase is necessary to explain the observed colour distributions among galaxies. We explore two different inside-out growth models and two different inside-out quenching models by varying parameters of the SFH between inner and outer regions of galaxies. Two of the models can explain the observed range of colour gradients in NUV - u and u - i colours. We further distinguish them using an additional constraint provided by the u - i colour gradient distribution, under the assumption of constant galaxy formation rate and a common SFH followed by most galaxies. We find the best model is an inside-out growth model in which the inner region has a shorter e-folding time-scale in the growth phase than the outer region. More spatially resolved UV observations are needed to improve the significance of the result.},

  abstract  = {Star formation quenching is a critical process that drive galaxies evolving from blue star-forming to red passive stage. This rapid quenching process is necessary in galaxy evolution models to explain the galaxy distribution in NUV-optical colour-colour diagrams1,2 and the buildup of red-sequence from z = 1 to z = 03,4,5. Yet, the mechanism of this quenching process is not fully understood and is of hot debate. Many candidate scenarios, such as strangulation due to shock heating in massive halos, AGN feedback or gas stripping due to environmental effect, have been proposed. To differentiate these scenarios, more constraints on the quenching process and thus the potential physical mechanism are badly needed. The first result we show in this poster is the properties of quenching process we obtained from the galaxy distribution in NUV-optical colour-colour diagrams.  Aside from the unclear integrated star formation history (SFH) of galaxies, how the SFH of galaxies varies internally is still poorly understood. One direct probe of the internal variation of SFH is the spatial distribution of colours, i.e. the colour gradient. In the second part of the results of this poster, we explicitly illustrate the definition of 'inside-out growth' and 'inside-out quenching' scenarios and utilize the galaxy distribution in the u-I colour gradients to see which one is more observationally favoured.},

Essentially all local low-mass quenched galaxies (QGs) are believed to live close to massive central galaxies, which is a demonstration of environmental quenching. We use CANDELS data to test $\{$$\backslash$it whether or not$\}$ such a dwarf QG--massive central galaxy connection exists beyond the local universe. To this purpose, we only need a statistically representative, rather than a complete, sample of low-mass galaxies, which enables our study to $z\gtrsim1.5$. For each low-mass galaxy, we measure the projected distance ($d\_{proj}$) to its nearest massive neighbor (M*$\gt10^{10.5} M\_\odot$) within a redshift range. At a given redshift and M*, the environmental quenching effect is considered to be observed if the $d\_{proj}$ distribution of QGs ($d\_{proj}^Q$) is significantly skewed toward lower values than that of star-forming galaxies ($d\_{proj}^{SF}$). For galaxies with $10^{8} M\_\odot \lt M* \lt 10^{10} M\_\odot$, such a difference between $d\_{proj}^Q$ and $d\_{proj}^{SF}$ is detected up to $z\sim1$. Also, about 10$\backslash$\% of the quenched galaxies in our sample are located between two and four virial radii ($R\_{Vir}$) of the massive halos. The median projected distance from low-mass QGs to their massive neighbors, $d\_{proj}^Q / R\_{Vir}$, decreases with satellite M* at $M* \lesssim 10^{9.5} M\_\odot$, but increases with satellite M* at $M* \gtrsim 10^{9.5} M\_\odot$. This trend suggests a smooth, if any, transition of the quenching timescale around $M* \sim 10^{9.5} M\_\odot$ at $0.5\ltz\lt1.0$.},

  abstract      = {We study galactic star-formation activity as a function of environment and stellar mass over 0.5$\lt$z$\lt$2.0 using the FourStar Galaxy Evolution (ZFOURGE) survey. We estimate the galaxy environment using a Bayesian-motivated measure of the distance to the third nearest neighbor for galaxies to the stellar mass completeness of our survey, $\log(M/M\_\odot)\gt9 (9.5)$ at z=1.3 (2.0). This method, when applied to a mock catalog with the photometric-redshift precision ($\sigma\_z / (1+z) \lesssim 0.02$), recovers galaxies in low- and high-density environments accurately. We quantify the environmental quenching efficiency, and show that at z$\gt$ 0.5 it depends on galaxy stellar mass, demonstrating that the effects of quenching related to (stellar) mass and environment are not separable. In high-density environments, the mass and environmental quenching efficiencies are comparable for massive galaxies ($\log (M/M\_\odot)\gtrsim$ 10.5) at all redshifts. For lower mass galaxies ($\log (M/M)\_\odot) \lesssim$ 10), the environmental quenching efficiency is very low at $z\gtrsim$ 1.5, but increases rapidly with decreasing redshift. Environmental quenching can account for nearly all quiescent lower mass galaxies ($\log(M/M\_\odot) \sim$ 9-10), which appear primarily at $z\lesssim$ 1.0. The morphologies of lower mass quiescent galaxies are inconsistent with those expected of recently quenched star-forming galaxies. Some environmental process must transform the morphologies on similar timescales as the environmental quenching itself. The evolution of the environmental quenching favors models that combine gas starvation (as galaxies become satellites) with gas exhaustion through star-formation and outflows (``overconsumption''), and additional processes such as galaxy interactions, tidal stripping and disk fading to account for the morphological differences between the quiescent and star-forming galaxy populations.},

We utilize a large sample of nearly 6000 groups, selected by fixed cumulative number density from three photometric catalogs, to follow the evolving quiescent fractions of central and satellite galaxies over roughly 11 Gyr. At z ~ 0, central galaxies in our sample range in stellar mass from Milky Way/M31 analogs ( M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sstarf.gif] {sstarf} / M ☉ = 6.5 × 10 10 ) to nearby massive ellipticals ( M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sstarf.gif] {sstarf} / M ☉ = 1.5 × 10 11 ). Satellite galaxies in the same groups reach masses as low as twice that of the Large Magellanic Cloud ( M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sstarf.gif] {sstarf} / M ☉ = 6.5 × 10 9 ). Using statistical background subtraction, we measure the average rest-frame colors of galaxies in our groups and calculate the evolving quiescent fractions of centrals and satellites over seven redshift bins. Our analysis shows clear evidence for star formation quenching in group halos, with a different quenching onset for centrals and their satellite galaxies. Using halo mass estimates for our central galaxies, we find that star formation shuts off in centrals when typical halo masses reach between 10 12 and 10 13 M ☉ , consistent with predictions from the halo quenching model. In contrast, satellite galaxies in the same groups most likely undergo quenching by environmental processes, whose onset is delayed with respect to their central galaxy. Although star formation is suppressed in all galaxies over time, the processes that govern quenching are different for centrals and satellites. While mass plays an important role in determining the star formation activity of central galaxies, quenching in satellite galaxies is dominated by the environment in which they reside.},

Although both the host halo mass and group-centric distance affect the satellite population, we find that these can be characterised by a single number, the quenched fraction, such that key features of the sSFR-$\Sigma\_{1kpc}$ diagram vary smoothly with this proxy for the ``environment''. Particularly, the sSFR of star-forming galaxies decreases smoothly with this quenched fraction, the sSFR of satellites being 0.1 dex lower than in the field. Furthermore, $\Sigma\_{1kpc}$ of the transition galaxies (i.e., the ``green valley'' or GV) decreases smoothly with the environment, by as much as 0.2 dex for $M\_* = 10^{9.75-10} M\_{\odot}$ from the field, and decreasing for satellites in larger halos and at smaller radial distances within same-mass halos. We interpret this shift as indicating the relative importance of today's field quenching track vs. the cluster quenching track. These environmental effects in the sSFR-$\Sigma\_{1kpc}$ diagram are most significant in our lowest mass range ($9.75 \lt \log M\_{*}/M\_{\odot} \lt 10$). One feature that is shared between all environments is that at a given $M\_{*}$ quenched galaxies have about 0.2-0.3 dex higher $\Sigma\_{1kpc}$ than the star-forming population. These results indicate that either $\Sigma\_{1kpc}$ increases (subsequent to satellite quenching), or $\Sigma\_{1kpc}$ for individual galaxies remains unchanged, but the original $M\_*$ or the time of quenching is significantly different from those now in the GV.},

The radial trends of D4000, W 0 (Hδ), and W 0 (O ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/527/1/54/img1.gif] {img1.gif} ) are all consistent with an age sequence, in the sense that the last episode of star formation occurred more recently in galaxies farthest from the cluster center. Throughout the cluster environment, galaxies show evidence for older stellar populations than field galaxies; they have weaker W 0 (O ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/527/1/54/img1.gif] {img1.gif} ) and W 0 (Hδ) lines and stronger D4000 indexes. From our primary sample of 1413 galaxies, statistically corrected for incompleteness and selection effects, we identify a sample of K+A galaxies, which have strong Hδ absorption lines [ W 0 (Hδ) > 5 Å] but no [O II ] emission [ W 0 (O ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/527/1/54/img1.gif] {img1.gif} ) < 5 Å], perhaps indicative of recently terminated star formation. The observed fraction of 4.4% ± 0.7% in the cluster sample is an overestimate due to a systematic effect that results from the large uncertainties on individual spectral index measurements. Corrected for this bias, we estimate that K+A galaxies make up only 2.1% ± 0.7% of the cluster sample and 0.1% ± 0.7% of the field. From the subsample of galaxies more luminous than M r = -18.8 + 5 log h , which is statistically representative of a complete sample to this limit, the corrected fraction of K+A galaxies is 1.5% ± 0.8% in the cluster and 1.2% ± 0.8% in the field. Compared with the z ≈ 0.1 fraction of 0.30%, the fraction of K+A galaxies in the CNOC1 field sample is greater by perhaps a factor of 4, but with only 1 σ significance; no further evolution of this fraction is detectable over our redshift range. We compare our data with the results of PEGASE and GISSEL96 spectrophotometric models and conclude, from the relative fractions of red and blue galaxies with no [O II ] λ3727 emission and strong Hδ absorption, that up to 1.9% ± 0.8% of the cluster population may have had its star formation recently truncated without a starburst. However, this is still not significantly greater than the fraction of such galaxies in the field, 3.1% ± 1.0%. Furthermore, we do not detect an excess of cluster galaxies that have unambiguously undergone starbursts within the last 1 Gyr. In fact, at 6.3% ± 2.1%, the A+em galaxies that Poggianti et al. have recently suggested are dusty starbursts are twice as common in the field as in the cluster environment. Our results imply that these cluster environments are not responsible for inducing starbursts; thus, the increase in cluster blue galaxy fraction with redshift may not be a strictly cluster-specific phenomenon. We suggest that the truncation of star formation in clusters may largely be a gradual process, perhaps due to the exhaustion of gas in the galactic disks over fairly long timescales; in this case differential evolution may result because field galaxies can refuel their disks with gas from extended halos, thus regenerating star formation, while cluster galaxies may not have such halos and so continue to evolve passively.},

We split our sample in satellite ($R\ltR\_{200}$), nearby ($1\ltR/R\_{200}\lt2.5$), and field ($R\gt2.5 R\_{\rm 200}$) galaxies. Simulated galaxies from all three groups are in excellent agreement with Local Group dwarf galaxies in terms of: stellar mass-velocity dispersion, stellar mass-metallicity relation, star formation histories, and stellar mass functions. Satellites and nearby galaxies show lower velocity dispersions and gas fractions compared to field galaxies. While field galaxies follow global abundance matching relations, satellites and nearby galaxies deviate from them, showing lower dark matter masses for given stellar mass. The reason for this deficit in dark matter mass is substantial mass loss experienced by satellites and $\sim80$$\backslash$\% of the nearby galaxies, while orbiting inside $R\_{200}$ at earlier times. However, both satellites and nearby objects fall back onto the relation for field galaxies if we use the maximum of their virial mass instead of the present-day value. This allows us to provide estimates for the peak masses of observed Local Group galaxies. Finally, using radial velocities, distances, and the velocity dispersion-stellar mass relation from our simulations, we derive a metric to distinguish between galaxies harassed by the central object and unaffected ones. Applying this metric to observed objects we find that even far away dwarf galaxies like Eri II ($D\approx$ 370 kpc) have a strong probability ($\approx 83$$\backslash$\%) of having been affected by the Milky Way in the past. This naturally explains the lack of gas and recent star formation seen in Eri II.},

We discuss the relation of these phenomena to the morphology of clusters, and find that some observed regularities in their observed properties can be explained.},

  abstract      = {Late-type galaxies falling into a cluster would evolve being influenced by the interactions with both the cluster and the nearby cluster member galaxies. Most numerical studies, however, tend to focus on the effects of the former with little work done on those of the latter. We thus perform a numerical study on the evolution of a late-type galaxy interacting with neighboring early-type galaxies at high speed, using hydrodynamic simulations. Based on the information obtained from the Coma cluster, we set up the simulations for the case where a Milky Way-like late-type galaxy experiences six consecutive collisions with twice as massive early-type galaxies having hot gas in their halos at the closest approach distances of 15-65 kpc/h at the relative velocities of 1500-1600 km/s. Our simulations show that the evolution of the late-type galaxy can be significantly affected by the accumulated effects of the high-speed multiple collisions with the early-type galaxies, such as on cold gas content and star formation activity of the late-type galaxy, particularly through the hydrodynamic interactions between cold disk and hot gas halos. We find that the late-type galaxy can lose most of its cold gas after the six collisions and have more star formation activity during the collisions. By comparing our simulation results with those of galaxy-cluster interactions, we claim that the role of the galaxy-galaxy interactions on the evolution of late-type galaxies in clusters could be comparable with that of the galaxy-cluster interactions, depending on the dynamical history.},

  abstract = { ▪ Abstract The Universe is in transition. At early times, galactic evolution was dominated by hierarchical clustering and merging, processes that are violent and rapid. In the far future, evolution will mostly be secular—the slow rearrangement of energy and mass that results from interactions involving collective phenomena such as bars, oval disks, spiral structure, and triaxial dark halos. Both processes are important now. This review discusses internal secular evolution, concentrating on one important consequence, the buildup of dense central components in disk galaxies that look like classical, merger-built bulges but that were made slowly out of disk gas. We call these pseudobulges. We begin with an “existence proof”—a review of how bars rearrange disk gas into outer rings, inner rings, and stuff dumped onto the center. The results of numerical simulations correspond closely to the morphology of barred galaxies. In the simulations, gas is transported to small radii, where it reaches high densities and plausibly feeds star formation. In the observations, many barred and oval galaxies have dense central concentrations of gas and star formation. Optical colors and spectra often imply young stellar populations. So the formation of pseudobulges is well supported by theory and observations. It is embedded in a broader evolution picture that accounts for much of the richness observed in galaxy structure. If secular processes built dense central components that masquerade as bulges, how can we distinguish them from merger-built bulges? Observations show that pseudobulges retain a memory of their disky origin. That is, they have one or more characteristics of disks: (a) flatter shapes than those of classical bulges, (b) correspondingly large ratios of ordered to random velocities, (c) small velocity dispersions σ with respect to the Faber-Jackson correlation between σ and bulge lumi nosity, (d) spiral structure or nuclear bars in the “bulge” part of the light profile, (e) nearly exponential brightness profiles, and ( f ) starbursts. All these structures occur preferentially in barred and oval galaxies, where secular evolution should be most rapid. So the cleanest examples of pseudobulges are recognizable. Are their formation timescales plausible? We use measurements of central gas densities and star-formation rates to show that pseudobulges of the observed densities form on timescales of a few billion years. Thus a large variety of observational and theoretical results lead to a new picture of galaxy evolution that complements hierarchical clustering and merging. Secular evolution consists of more than the aging of stellar populations. Every galaxy is dynamically evolving. },

This galaxy resembles the Hoag's galaxy, one of the most spectacular examples of ring galaxies, characterized by a completely detached ring of young stars surrounding a central old spheroid. At odds with the isolated Hoag's galaxy, JO171 is part of a dense environment, the cluster Abell 3667, which is causing gas stripping along tentacles. Moreover, its ring counter-rotates with respect to the central spheroid. The joint analysis of the stellar populations and the gas/stellar kinematics shows that the origin of the ring was not due to an internal mechanism, but was related to a gas accretion event that happened in the distant past, prior to accretion onto Abell 3667, most probably within a filament. More recently, since infall in the cluster, the gas in the ring has been stripped by ram- pressure, causing the quenching of star formation in the stripped half of the ring. This is the first observed case of ram pressure stripping in action in a ring galaxy, and MUSE observations are able to reveal both of the events (accretion and stripping) that caused dramatic transformations in this galaxy.},

  abstract = {We explore the simple inter-relationships between mass, star formation rate, and environment in the SDSS, zCOSMOS, and other deep surveys. We take a purely empirical approach in identifying those features of galaxy evolution that are demanded by the data and then explore the analytic consequences of these. We show that the differential effects of mass and environment are completely separable to z ~ 1, leading to the idea of two distinct processes of "mass quenching" and "environment quenching." The effect of environment quenching, at fixed over-density, evidently does not change with epoch to z ~ 1 in zCOSMOS, suggesting that the environment quenching occurs as large-scale structure develops in the universe, probably through the cessation of star formation in 30%-70% of satellite galaxies. In contrast, mass quenching appears to be a more dynamic process, governed by a quenching rate. We show that the observed constancy of the Schechter M * and α s for star-forming galaxies demands that the quenching of galaxies around and above M * must follow a rate that is statistically proportional to their star formation rates (or closely mimic such a dependence). We then postulate that this simple mass-quenching law in fact holds over a much broader range of stellar mass (2 dex) and cosmic time. We show that the combination of these two quenching processes, plus some additional quenching due to merging naturally produces (1) a quasi-static single Schechter mass function for star-forming galaxies with an exponential cutoff at a value M * that is set uniquely by the constant of proportionality between the star formation and mass quenching rates and (2) a double Schechter function for passive galaxies with two components. The dominant component (at high masses) is produced by mass quenching and has exactly the same M * as the star-forming galaxies but a faint end slope that differs by Δα s ~ 1. The other component is produced by environment effects and has the same M * and α s as the star-forming galaxies but an amplitude that is strongly dependent on environment. Subsequent merging of quenched galaxies will modify these predictions somewhat in the denser environments, mildly increasing M * and making α s slightly more negative. All of these detailed quantitative inter-relationships between the Schechter parameters of the star-forming and passive galaxies, across a broad range of environments, are indeed seen to high accuracy in the SDSS, lending strong support to our simple empirically based model. We find that the amount of post-quenching "dry merging" that could have occurred is quite constrained. Our model gives a prediction for the mass function of the population of transitory objects that are in the process of being quenched. Our simple empirical laws for the cessation of star formation in galaxies also naturally produce the "anti-hierarchical" run of mean age with mass for passive galaxies, as well as the qualitative variation of formation timescale indicated by the relative α-element abundances.},

We find, among other trends, that our measure of the star formation rate surface density, Σ SFR , is nearly constant along this sequence. We discuss this result and implications for galaxies at higher redshift. For the first time, we report on measurements of the local UV luminosity function versus galaxy structural parameters, as well as inclination. We also split our sample into disk-dominated and bulge-dominated subsamples using the i -band Sersic index and find that disk-dominated galaxies occupy a very tight locus in SFR/ M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/star.gif] {star} vs. M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/star.gif] {star} space, while bulge-dominated galaxies display a much larger spread of SFR/ M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/star.gif] {star} at fixed stellar mass. A significant fraction of galaxies with SFR/ M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/star.gif] {star} and Σ SFR above those on the "star-forming sequence" are bulge-dominated. We can use our derived distribution functions to ask whether a significant fraction of these galaxies may be experiencing a final episode of star formation (possibly induced by a merger or other burst), soon to be quenched, by determining whether this population can explain the growth rate of the non-star-forming galaxies on the "red sequence." We find that this is a plausible scenario for bulge-dominated galaxies near the characteristic transition mass under reasonable assumptions regarding quenching timescales. Similarly, we use this technique to estimate the rate of mergers/starbursts that take galaxies off of the star-forming sequence and show that the implied merger rates are consistent with local measurements.},

We used an orbit integration scheme to find which estimate of the transverse velocity of M31 more favors the interaction scenario and then tried to reproduce it in our simulations. M33 was modeled as a stellar and gaseous disk embedded in a live dark-matter halo, while M31 was approximated only with a live dark halo. In the simulations the two galaxies passed each other with a pericenter distance of 37 kpc. Tides excited a two-armed spiral structure in the M33 disk, which is found to be the predominant spiral signal in the observed galaxy and has been long known as a feature easily induced by tidal interactions. We found that the gaseous warp produced by the interaction did not resemble enough the observed one and we performed an additional simulation including the hot gas halo of M31 to show that this feature can be properly reproduced by tidal forces and ram pressure stripping acting simultaneously on the gaseous disk. In addition to the spiral arms, tidal forces produced the stellar stream similar to the observed one and triggered a star formation burst at similar radii as it is observed.},

The formation and growth of galaxies over time is connected to the growth of the halos in which they form. The advent of large galaxy surveys as well as high-resolution cosmological simulations has provided a new window into the statistical relationship between galaxies and halos and its evolution. Here we define this galaxy-halo connection as the multi-variate distribution of galaxy and halo properties that can be derived from observations and simulations. This connection provides a key test of physical galaxy formation models; it also plays an essential role in constraints of cosmological models using galaxy surveys and in elucidating the properties of dark matter using galaxies. We review techniques for inferring the galaxy-halo connection and the insights that have arisen from these approaches. Some things we have learned are that galaxy formation efficiency is a strong function of halo mass; at its peak in halos around a pivot halo mass of 10\^{}12 Msun, less than 20\% of the available baryons have turned into stars by the present day; the intrinsic scatter in galaxy stellar mass is small, less than 0.2 dex at a given halo mass above this pivot mass; below this pivot mass galaxy stellar mass is a strong function of halo mass; the majority of stars over cosmic time were formed in a narrow region around this pivot mass. We also highlight key open questions about how galaxies and halos are connected, including understanding the correlations with secondary properties and the connection of these properties to galaxy clustering.},

The rest-frame K- band luminosity function and its evolution with redshift are described. Comparisons are made with other optically selected (B and I) samples in the literature, and the corresponding rest-frame B-band luminosity function evolution is presented. The B-band counts at B \~{} 24 are shown to be a mixture of normal galaxies at modest redshifts and galaxies undergoing rapid star formation, which have a wide range of masses and which are spread over the redshift interval from z = 0.2 to beyond z = 1.7. The luminosity functions, number counts, and color distributions at optical and IR wavelengths are discussed in terms of a consistent picture of the star-forming history of the galaxy sample. [O II] emission-line diagnostics or rest-frame ultraviolet-infrared color information are used in combination with rest-frame absolute H magnitudes to construct a ``fundamental plane'' in which the evolution of the global star-formation rate with redshift can be shown, and we find that the maximum rest-frame K luminosity of galaxies undergoing rapid star formation has been declining smoothly with decreasing redshift from a value near L\_*\_ at z $\gt$ 1. This smooth decrease in the characteristic luminosity of galaxies dominated by star formation can simultaneously account for the high B- band galaxy counts at faint magnitudes and the redshift distribution at z $\lt$ 1 in both the B- and K-selected samples. Finally, the overall K-band light density evolution is discussed as a tracer of the baryonic mass in stars and compared with the overall rates of star formation inferred from the rest-frame ultraviolet light density as a function of redshift.},

For z ~ 2 galaxies with moderate luminosities ( L 8 μm < 10 11 L ☉ ), we find that the SFR can be estimated consistently from the multiwavelength data based on local luminosity correlations. However, 20%-30% of massive galaxies, and nearly all those with L 8 μm > 10 11 L ☉ , show a mid-IR excess that is likely due to the presence of obscured active nuclei, as shown in a companion paper. There is a tight and roughly linear correlation between stellar mass and SFR for 24 μm-detected galaxies. For a given mass, the SFR at z = 2 was larger by a factor of ~4 and ~30 relative to that in star-forming galaxies at z = 1 and 0, respectively. Typical ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z = 2 are relatively "transparent" to ultraviolet light, and their activity is long lived ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {gtrsim} 400 Myr), unlike that in local ULIRGs and high-redshift submillimeter-selected galaxies. ULIRGs are the common mode of star formation in massive galaxies at z = 2, and the high duty cycle suggests that major mergers are not the dominant trigger for this activity. Current galaxy formation models underpredict the normalization of the mass-SFR correlation by about a factor of 4 and the space density of ULIRGs by an order of magnitude but give better agreement for z > 1.4 quiescent galaxies.},

Instead, bulges (and black holes) likely formed in lockstep with disks, through bar instabilities, migration, or other processes. We find that after z = 1 the growth in the central regions gradually stopped and the disk continued to be built up, consistent with recent studies of the gas distributions in z ~ 1 galaxies and the properties of many spiral galaxies today.},

  abstract      = {While major mergers have long been proposed as a driver of both AGN activity and the M-sigma relation, studies of moderate to high redshift Seyfert-luminosity AGN hosts have found little evidence for enhanced rates of interactions. However, both theory and observation suggest that while these AGN may be fueled by stochastic accretion and secular processes, high-luminosity, high-redshift, and heavily obscured AGN are the AGN most likely to be merger-driven. To better sample this population of AGN, we turn to infrared selection in the CANDELS/COSMOS field. Compared to their lower-luminosity and less obscured X-ray-only counterparts, IR-only AGN (luminous, heavily obscured AGN) are more likely to be classified as either irregular (50$^{+12}\_{-12}$\% vs. 9$^{+5}\_{-2}$\%) or asymmetric (69$^{+9}\_{-13}$\% vs. 17$^{+6}\_{-4}$\%) and are less likely to have a spheroidal component (31$^{+13}\_{-9}$\% vs. 77$^{+4}\_{-6}$\%). Furthermore, IR-only AGN are also significantly more likely than X-ray-only AGN (75$^{+8}\_{-13}$\% vs. 31$^{+6}\_{-6}$\%) to be classified either as interacting or merging in a way that significantly disturbs the host galaxy or disturbed though not clearly interacting or merging, which potentially represents the late stages of a major merger. This suggests that while major mergers may not contribute significantly to the fueling of Seyfert luminosity AGN, interactions appear to play a more dominant role in the triggering and fueling of high-luminosity heavily obscured AGN.},

After converting literature B -band disk galaxy magnitudes into inclination- and dust-corrected bulge magnitudes, via a useful new equation presented herein, we obtain a similar result. Unlike with the M bh -(velocity dispersion) diagram, which is also updated here using the same galaxy sample, it remains unknown whether barred and non-barred Sérsic galaxies are offset from each other in the M bh - L diagram. While black hole feedback has typically been invoked to explain what was previously thought to be a nearly constant M bh / M Spheroid mass ratio of ~0.2%, we advocate that the near-linear M bh - L and M bh - M Spheroid relations observed at high masses may have instead arisen largely from the additive dry merging of galaxies. We argue that feedback results in a dramatically different scaling relation, such that black hole mass scales roughly quadratically with the spheroid mass in Sérsic galaxies. We therefore introduce a revised cold-gas "quasar" mode feeding equation for semi-analytical models to reflect what we dub the quadratic growth of black holes in Sérsic galaxies built amidst gas-rich processes. Finally, we use our new Sérsic M bh - L equations to predict the masses of candidate intermediate mass black holes in almost 50 low-luminosity spheroids containing active galactic nuclei, finding many masses between that of stellar mass black holes and supermassive black holes.},

  abstract      = {[abridged] We quantify the evolution of the stellar mass functions of star-forming and quiescent galaxies as a function of morphology from $z\sim 3$ to the present. Our sample consists of \~{}50,000 galaxies in the CANDELS fields ($\sim880$ $arcmin^2$), which we divide into four main morphological types, i.e. pure bulge dominated systems, pure spiral disk dominated, intermediate 2-component bulge+disk systems and irregular disturbed galaxies. Our main results are: Star-formation: At $z\sim 2$, 80$\backslash$\% of the stellar mass density of star-forming galaxies is in irregular systems. However, by $z\sim 0.5$, irregular objects only dominate at stellar masses below $10^9M\odot$. A majority of the star-forming irregulars present at $z\sim 2$ undergo a gradual transformation from disturbed to normal spiral disk morphologies by $z\sim 1$ without significant interruption to their star-formation. Rejuvenation after a quenching event does not seem to be common except perhaps for the most massive objects. Quenching: We confirm that galaxies reaching a stellar mass of $M\_*\sim10^{10.8}M\_\odot$ ($M^*$) tend to quench. Also, quenching implies the presence of a bulge: the abundance of massive red disks is negligible at all redshifts over 2\~{}dex in stellar mass. However the dominant quenching mechanism evolves. At $z\gt2$, the SMF of quiescent galaxies above $M^*$ is dominated by compact spheroids. Quenching at this early epoch destroys the disk and produces a compact remnant unless the star-forming progenitors at even higher redshifts are significantly more dense. At $1\ltz\lt2$, the majority of newly quenched galaxies are disks with a significant central bulge. This suggests that mass-quenching at this epoch starts from the inner parts and preserves the disk. At $z\lt1$, the high mass end of the passive SMF is globally in place and the evolution mostly happens at stellar masses below $10^{10}M\_\odot$.},

Between ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn12.gif] {$z\sim 2.5$} and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn13.gif] {$z\sim 0$} , they rapidly increase their size by a factor of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn14.gif] {$\sim 4-5$} , are quenched, and slightly increase their Sérsic indices ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn15.gif] {$n\sim 5$} ) but their global morphology remains unaltered. The structural evolution is independent of the gas fractions, suggesting that it is driven by ex situ events. The remaining 60% experience a gradual morphological transformation, from clumpy disks to more regular bulge+disk systems, essentially happening at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn16.gif] {$z\gt 1$} .

The transition phase between disturbed and relaxed systems and the emergence of the bulge is correlated with a decrease in the star formation activity and the gas fractions, suggesting a morphological quenching process as a plausible mechanism for the formation of these bulges.},

  abstract = {We aim to provide a holistic view on the typical size and kinematic evolution of massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) that encompasses their high- z star-forming progenitors, their high- z quiescent counterparts, and their configurations in the local Universe. Our investigation covers the main processes playing a relevant role in the cosmic evolution of ETGs. Specifically, their early fast evolution comprises biased collapse of the low angular momentum gaseous baryons located in the inner regions of the host dark matter halo; cooling, fragmentation, and infall of the gas down to the radius set by the centrifugal barrier; further rapid compaction via clump/gas migration toward the galaxy center, where strong heavily dust-enshrouded star formation takes place and most of the stellar mass is accumulated; and ejection of substantial gas amount from the inner regions by feedback processes, which causes a dramatic puffing-up of the stellar component. In the late slow evolution, passive aging of stellar populations and mass additions by dry merger events occur. We describe these processes relying on prescriptions inspired by basic physical arguments and by numerical simulations to derive new analytical estimates of the relevant sizes, timescales, and kinematic properties for individual galaxies along their evolution. Then we obtain quantitative results as a function of galaxy mass and redshift, and compare them to recent observational constraints on half-light size R e , on the ratio v / σ between rotation velocity and velocity dispersion (for gas and stars) and on the specific angular momentum j ⋆ of the stellar component; we find good consistency with the available multiband data in average values and dispersion, both for local ETGs and for their z ∼ 1–2 star-forming and quiescent progenitors. The outcomes of our analysis can provide hints to gauge sub-grid recipes implemented in simulations, to tune numerical experiments focused on specific processes, and to plan future multiband, high-resolution observations on high-redshift star-forming and quiescent galaxies with next-generation facilities.},

We demonstrate that the correlation between the stellar mass surface density ($\Sigma\_*$) and star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma\_{\mathrm{SFR}}$) holds down to sub-galactic scale, leading to the Sub-Galactic Main Sequence (SGMS). By dividing galaxies into two populations based on their recent mass assembly modes, we find the resolved main sequence in galaxies with 'outside-in' mode is steeper than that in galaxies with 'inside-out' mode. This is also confirmed on a galaxy-by-galaxy level, where we find the distributions of SGMS slopes for individual galaxies are clearly separated for the two populations. When normalizing and stacking the SGMS of individual galaxies on one panel for the two populations, we find the inner regions of galaxies with 'inside-out' mode statistically exhibit a suppression in star formation, with a less significant trend in the outer regions of galaxies with 'outside-in' mode. In contrast, the inner regions of galaxies with 'outside-in' mode and the outer regions of galaxies with 'inside-out' mode follow a slightly sub-linear scaling relation with a slope $\sim$0.9, which is in good agreement with previous findings, suggesting that they are experiencing a universal regulation without influences of additional physical processes.},

  abstract = {Using a high-resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulation of the formation of a massive spheroidal galaxy we show that elliptical galaxies can be very compact and massive at high redshift in agreement with recent observations. Accretion of stripped infalling stellar material increases the size of the system with time and the central concentration is reduced by dynamical friction of the surviving stellar cores. In a specific case of a spheroidal galaxy with a final stellar mass of 1.5 × 10 11 M ☉ we find that the effective radius r e increases from 0.7 ± 0.2 kpc at z = 3 to r e = 2.4 ± 0.4 kpc at z = 0 with a concomitant decrease in the effective density of an order of magnitude and a decrease of the central velocity dispersion by approximately 20% over this time interval. A simple argument based on the virial theorem shows that during the accretion of weakly bound material (minor mergers) the radius can increase as the square of the mass in contrast to the usual linear rate of increase for major mergers. By undergoing minor mergers compact high-redshift spheroids can evolve into present-day systems with sizes and concentrations similar to observed local ellipticals. This indicates that minor mergers may be the main driver for the late evolution of sizes and densities of early-type galaxies.},

  abstract = {We present H α maps at 1 kpc spatial resolution for star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 1, made possible by the Wide Field Camera 3 grism on Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ). Employing this capability over all five 3D- HST /CANDELS fields provides a sample of 3200 galaxies enabling a division into subsamples based on stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR). By creating deep stacked H α images, we reach surface brightness limits of 1 × 10 −18 erg s −1 cm −2 arcsec −2 , allowing us to map the distribution of ionized gas to ∼10 kpc for typical L * galaxies at this epoch. We find that the spatial extent of the H α distribution increases with stellar mass as ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/828/1/27/apjaa2d0cieqn1.gif] {${r}_{{\rm{H}}\alpha }=1.5{({M}_{* }/{10}^{10}{M}_{\odot })}^{0.23}$} kpc. The H α emission is more extended than the stellar continuum emission, consistent with inside-out assembly of galactic disks. This effect grows stronger with mass as ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/828/1/27/apjaa2d0cieqn2.gif] {${r}_{{\rm{H}}\alpha }/{r}_{* }=1.1\,{({M}_{* }/{10}^{10}{M}_{\odot })}^{0.054}$} . We map the H α distribution as a function of SFR(IR+UV) and find evidence for “coherent star formation” across the SFR– M * plane: above the main sequence (MS), H α is enhanced at all radii; below the MS, H α is depressed at all radii. This suggests that at all masses the physical processes driving the enhancement or suppression of star formation act throughout the disks of galaxies.

  abstract = {Galaxies with stellar masses near M * contain the majority of stellar mass in the universe, and are therefore of special interest in the study of galaxy evolution. The Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) have present-day stellar masses near M *, at 5 × 10 10 M ☉ (defined here to be MW-mass) and 10 11 M ☉ (defined to be M31-mass). We study the typical progenitors of these galaxies using the FOURSTAR Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE). ZFOURGE is a deep medium-band near-IR imaging survey, which is sensitive to the progenitors of these galaxies out to z ~ 3. We use abundance-matching techniques to identify the main progenitors of these galaxies at higher redshifts. We measure the evolution in the stellar mass, rest-frame colors, morphologies, far-IR luminosities, and star formation rates, combining our deep multiwavelength imaging with near-IR Hubble Space Telescope imaging from Cosmic Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS), and Spitzer and Herschel far-IR imaging from Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-Herschel and CANDELS-Herschel. The typical MW-mass and M31-mass progenitors passed through the same evolution stages, evolving from blue, star-forming disk galaxies at the earliest stages to redder dust-obscured IR-luminous galaxies in intermediate stages and to red, more quiescent galaxies at their latest stages. The progenitors of the MW-mass galaxies reached each evolutionary stage at later times (lower redshifts) and with stellar masses that are a factor of two to three lower than the progenitors of the M31-mass galaxies. The process driving this evolution, including the suppression of star formation in present-day M * galaxies, requires an evolving stellar-mass/halo-mass ratio and/or evolving halo-mass threshold for quiescent galaxies. The effective size and SFRs imply that the baryonic cold-gas fractions drop as galaxies evolve from high redshift to z ~ 0 and are strongly anticorrelated with an increase in the Sérsic index. Therefore, the growth of galaxy bulges in M * galaxies corresponds to a rapid decline in the galaxy gas fractions and/or a decrease in the star formation efficiency.},

  abstract = {We study the structural evolution of massive galaxies by linking progenitors and descendants at a constant cumulative number density of n c = 1.4 × 10 –4 Mpc –3 to z ~ 3. Structural parameters were measured by fitting Sérsic profiles to high-resolution CANDELS HST WFC3 J 125 and H 160 imaging in the UKIDSS-UDS at 1 < z < 3 and ACS I 814 imaging in COSMOS at 0.25 < z < 1. At a given redshift, we selected the HST band that most closely samples a common rest-frame wavelength so as to minimize systematics from color gradients in galaxies. At fixed n c , galaxies grow in stellar mass by a factor of ~3 from z ~ 3 to z ~ 0. The size evolution is complex: galaxies appear roughly constant in size from z ~ 3 to z ~ 2 and then grow rapidly to lower redshifts. The evolution in the surface mass density profiles indicates that most of the mass at r < 2 kpc was in place by z ~ 2, and that most of the new mass growth occurred at larger radii. This inside-out mass growth is therefore responsible for the larger sizes and higher Sérsic indices of the descendants toward low redshift. At z < 2, the effective radius evolves with the stellar mass as r e ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} M 2.0 , consistent with scenarios that find dissipationless minor mergers to be a key driver of size evolution. The progenitors at z ~ 3 were likely star-forming disks with r e ~ 2 kpc, based on their low Sérsic index of n ~ 1, low median axis ratio of b / a ~ 0.52, and typical location in the star-forming region of the U – V versus V – J diagram. By z ~ 1.5, many of these star-forming disks disappeared, giving rise to compact quiescent galaxies. Toward lower redshifts, these galaxies continued to assemble mass at larger radii and became the local ellipticals that dominate the high-mass end of the mass function at the present epoch.},

We calculate stellar masses and photometric redshifts, based on \~{}2000 templates built with stellar population and dust emission models fitting the ultraviolet to mid-infrared spectral energy distributions of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts. We estimate stellar mass functions for different redshift intervals. We find that 50\% of the local stellar mass density was assembled at 0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1 (average star formation rate [SFR] 0.048 M$_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$), and at least another 40\% at 1 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 4 (average SFR 0.074 M$_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$). Our results confirm and quantify the ``downsizing'' scenario of galaxy formation. The most massive galaxies (M $\gt$ 10$^{12.0}$ M$_{⊙}$) assembled the bulk of their stellar content rapidly (in 1-2 Gyr) beyond z \~{} 3 in very intense star formation events (producing high specific SFRs). Galaxies with 10$^{11.5}$ $\lt$ M $\lt$ 10$^{12.0}$ M$_{⊙}$ assembled half of their stellar mass before z \~{} 1.5, and more than 90\% of their mass was already in place at z \~{} 0.6. Galaxies with M $\lt$ 10$^{11.5}$ M$_{⊙}$ evolved more slowly (presenting smaller specific SFRs), assembling half of their stellar mass below z \~{} 1. About 40\% of the local stellar mass density of 10$^{9.0}$ $\lt$ M $\lt$ 10$^{11.0}$ M$_{⊙}$ galaxies was assembled below z \~{} 0.4, most probably through accretion of small satellites producing little star formation. The cosmic stellar mass density at z $\gt$ 2.5 is dominated by optically faint (Rgtrsim 25) red galaxies (distant red galaxies or BzK sources), which account for \~{}30\% of the global population of galaxies, but contribute at least 60\% of the cosmic stellar mass density. Bluer galaxies (e.g., Lyman break galaxies) are more numerous but less massive, contributing less than 50\% of the global stellar mass density at high redshift.},

Measurements of galaxy rotation velocity $V\_{rot}$, which quantify ordered motions, and gas velocity dispersion $\sigma\_g$, which quantify disordered motions, are adopted from the DEEP2 and SIGMA surveys. This sample covers a continuous baseline in redshift from $z=2.5$ to $z=0.1$, spanning 10 Gyrs. At low redshift, nearly all sufficiently massive star-forming galaxies are rotationally supported ($V\_{rot}\gt\sigma\_g$). By $z=2$, the percentage of galaxies with rotational support has declined to 50$\\%$ at low stellar mass ($10^{9}-10^{10}\,M\_{\odot}$) and 70$\\%$ at high stellar mass ($10^{10}-10^{11}M\_{\odot}$). For $V\_{rot}\,\gt\,3\,\sigma\_g$, the percentage drops below 35$\\%$ for all masses. From $z\,=\,2$ to now, galaxies exhibit remarkably smooth kinematic evolution on average. All galaxies tend towards rotational support with time, and it is reached earlier in higher mass systems. This is mostly due to an average decline in $\sigma\_g$ by a factor of 3 since a redshift of 2, which is independent of mass. Over the same time period, $V\_{rot}$ increases by a factor of 1.5 for low mass systems, but does not evolve for high mass systems. These trends in $V\_{rot}$ and $\sigma\_g$ with time are at a fixed stellar mass and should not be interpreted as evolutionary tracks for galaxy populations. When galaxy populations are linked in time with abundance matching, not only does $\sigma\_g$ decline with time as before, but $V\_{rot}$ strongly increases with time for all galaxy masses. This enhances the evolution in $V\_{rot}/\sigma\_g$. These results indicate that $z\,=\,2$ is a period of disk assembly, during which the strong rotational support present in today's massive disk galaxies is only just beginning to emerge.},

  abstract = {One of the central features of the last 8-10 billion years of cosmic history has been the emergence of a well-populated red sequence of non-star-forming galaxies. A number of models of galaxy formation and evolution have been devised to attempt to explain this behavior. Most current models require feedback from supermassive black holes (AGN feedback) to quench star formation in galaxies in the centers of their dark matter halos (central galaxies). Such models make the strong prediction that all quenched central galaxies must have a large supermassive black hole (and, by association, a prominent bulge component). I show using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey that the observations are consistent with this prediction. Over 99.5% of red-sequence galaxies with stellar masses in excess of 10 10 M ☉ have a prominent bulge component (as defined by having a Sérsic index n above 1.5). Those very rare red-sequence central galaxies with little or no bulge ( n < 1.5) usually have detectable star formation or AGN activity; the fraction of truly quenched bulgeless central galaxies is <0.1% of the total red-sequence population. I conclude that a bulge, and by implication a supermassive black hole, is an absolute requirement for full quenching of star formation in central galaxies. This is in agreement with the most basic prediction of the AGN feedback paradigm.},

  abstract      = {We present stellar rotation curves and velocity dispersion profiles for 104 quiescent galaxies at $z=0.6-1$ from the Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) spectroscopic survey. Rotation is typically probed across 10-20kpc, or to an average of 2.7${\rm R\_e}$. Combined with central stellar velocity dispersions ($\sigma\_0$) this provides the first determination of the dynamical state of a sample selected by a lack of star formation activity at large lookback time. The most massive galaxies ($M\_{\star}\gt2\times10^{11}\,M\_{\odot}$) generally show no or little rotation measured at 5kpc ($|V\_5|/\sigma\_0\lt0.2$ in 8 of 10 cases), while ${\sim}64\\%$ of less massive galaxies show significant rotation. This is reminiscent of local fast- and slow-rotating ellipticals and implies that low- and high-redshift quiescent galaxies have qualitatively similar dynamical structures. We compare $|V\_5|/\sigma\_0$ distributions at $z\sim0.8$ and the present day by re-binning and smoothing the kinematic maps of 91 low-redshift quiescent galaxies from the CALIFA survey and find evidence for a decrease in rotational support since $z\sim1$. This result is especially strong when galaxies are compared at fixed velocity dispersion; if velocity dispersion does not evolve for individual galaxies then the rotational velocity at 5kpc was an average of ${94\pm22\\%}$ higher in $z\sim0.8$ quiescent galaxies than today. Considering that the number of quiescent galaxies grows with time and that new additions to the population descend from rotationally-supported star-forming galaxies, our results imply that quiescent galaxies must lose angular momentum between $z\sim1$ and the present, presumably through dissipationless merging, and/or that the mechanism that transforms star-forming galaxies also reduces their rotational support.},

  abstract      = {We present results from a survey of the internal kinematics of 49 star-forming galaxies at z$\,\sim\,$2 in the CANDELS fields with the Keck/MOSFIRE spectrograph (SIGMA, Survey in the near-Infrared of Galaxies with Multiple position Angles). Kinematics (rotation velocity $V\_{rot}$ and integrated gas velocity dispersion $\sigma\_g$) are measured from nebular emission lines which trace the hot ionized gas surrounding star-forming regions. We find that by z$\,\sim\,$2, massive star-forming galaxies ($\log\,M\_*/M\_{\odot}\gtrsim10.2$) have assembled primitive disks: their kinematics are dominated by rotation, they are consistent with a marginally stable disk model, and they form a Tully-Fisher relation. These massive galaxies have values of $V\_{rot}/\sigma\_g$ which are factors of 2-5 lower than local well-ordered galaxies at similar masses. Such results are consistent with findings by other studies. We find that low mass galaxies ($\log\,M\_*/M\_{\odot}\lesssim10.2$) at this epoch are still in the early stages of disk assembly: their kinematics are often supported by gas velocity dispersion and they fall from the Tully-Fisher relation to significantly low values of $V\_{rot}$. This ``kinematic downsizing'' implies that the process(es) responsible for disrupting disks at z$\,\sim\,$2 have a stronger effect and/or are more active in low mass systems. In conclusion, we find that the period of rapid stellar mass growth at z$\,\sim\,$2 is coincident with the nascent assembly of low mass disks and the assembly and settling of high mass disks.},

Their disturbed, bulge-dominated morphologies suggest that they are merger remnants. The more massive E+A galaxies are suggested to be quenched by AGN feedback, yet little is known about AGN-driven winds in this short-lived phase. We present spatially-resolved IFU spectroscopy by the Keck Cosmic Web Imager of SDSS J003443.68+251020.9, at z=0.118. The system consists of two galaxies, the larger of which is a post starburst E+A galaxy hosting an AGN. Our modelling suggests a 400 Myrs starburst, with a peak star formation rate of 120 Msun/yr. The observations reveal stationary and outflowing gas, photoionized by the central AGN. We detect gas outflows to a distance of 17 kpc from the central galaxy, far beyond the region of the stars (about 3 kpc), inside a conic structure with an opening angle of 70 degrees. We construct self-consistent photoionization and dynamical models for the different gas components and show that the gas outside the galaxy forms a continuous flow, with a mass outflow rate of about 24 Msun/yr. The gas mass in the flow, roughly $10^9$ Msun, is larger than the total gas mass within the galaxy, some of which is outflowing too. The continuity of the flow puts a lower limit of 60 Myrs on the duration of the AGN feedback. Such AGN are capable of removing, in a single episode, most of the gas from their host galaxies and expelling enriched material into the surrounding CGM.},

Using ALMA and PdBI observations, we spatially resolve the CO(1-0) emission from the outflowing molecular gas in both and find maximum outflow velocities of $ v\_{\rm max} \sim 1600$ and $\sim 1700$ km/s for IRAS 20100-4156 and IRAS 03158+4227, respectively. We find total gas mass outflow rates of $\dot M\_{\rm OF} \sim 670$ and $\sim 350$ Msun/yr, respectively, corresponding to molecular gas depletion timescales $\tau^{\rm dep}\_{\rm OF} \sim 11$ and $\sim 16$ Myr. This is nearly 3 times shorter than the depletion timescales implied by star formation, $\tau^{\rm dep}\_{\rm SFR} \sim 33$ and $\sim 46$ Myr, respectively. To determine the outflow driving mechanism, we compare the starburst ($L\_{*}$) and AGN ($L\_{\rm AGN}$) luminosities to the outflowing energy and momentum fluxes, using mid-infrared spectral decomposition to discern $L\_{\rm AGN}$. Comparison to other molecular outflows in ULIRGs reveals that outflow properties correlate similarly with $L\_{*}$ and $L\_{\rm IR}$ as with $L\_{\rm AGN}$, indicating that AGN luminosity alone may not be a good tracer of feedback strength and that a combination of AGN and starburst activity may be driving the most powerful molecular outflows. We also detect the OH 1.667 GHz maser line from both sources and demonstrate its utility in detecting molecular outflows.},

  abstract      = {A maximum stellar surface density $\Sigma\_{max} \sim 3 \times 10^5\,{\rm M\_\odot\,pc^{-2}}$ is observed across all classes of dense stellar systems (e.g. star clusters, galactic nuclei, etc.), spanning $\sim 8$ orders of magnitude in mass. It has been proposed that this characteristic scale is set by some dynamical feedback mechanism preventing collapse beyond a certain surface density. However, simple analytic models and detailed simulations of star formation moderated by feedback from massive stars argue that feedback becomes $\{$$\backslash$it less$\}$ efficient at higher surface densities (with the star formation efficiency increasing as $\sim \Sigma/\Sigma\_{crit}$). We therefore propose an alternative model wherein stellar feedback becomes ineffective at moderating star formation above some $\Sigma\_{crit}$, so the supply of star-forming gas is rapidly converted to stars before the system can contract to higher surface density. We show that such a model -- with $\Sigma\_{crit}$ taken directly from the theory -- naturally predicts the observed $\Sigma\_{max}$. $\Sigma\_{max}\sim 100\Sigma\_{crit}$ because the gas consumption time is longer than the global freefall time even when feedback is ineffective. Moreover the predicted $\Sigma\_{max}$ is robust to spatial scale and metallicity, and is preserved even if multiple episodes of star formation/gas inflow occur. In this context, the observed $\Sigma\_{max}$ directly tells us where feedback fails.},

The simulations use the AREPO moving-mesh code with a set of physical models for galaxy formation based on the successful Illustris simulation, but with updated AGN and supernovae feedback models. This allows us to simultaneously reproduce the observed redshift evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function together with the stellar and gas mass fractions of local groups and clusters across a wide range of halo masses. Focusing on the properties of groups and clusters, we find very good agreement with a range of observed scaling relations, including the X-ray luminosity--total mass and gas mass relations as well as the total mass--temperature and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich flux--mass relations. Careful comparison of our results with scaling relations based on X-ray hydrostatic masses as opposed to weak lensing-derived masses reveals some discrepancies, which hint towards a non-negligible X-ray mass bias in observed samples. We further show that radial profiles of density, pressure and temperature of the simulated intracluster medium are in very good agreement with observations, in particular for $r > 0.3\ r_{500}$. In the innermost regions however we find too large entropy cores, which indicates that a more sophisticated modelling of the physics of AGN feedback may be required to accurately reproduce the observed populations of cool-core and non-cool-core clusters.},

  abstract = {Post-starbursts are galaxies in transition from the blue cloud to the red sequence. Although they are rare today, integrated over time they may be an important pathway to the red sequence. This work uses Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Galaxy Evolution Explorer , and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer observations to identify the evolutionary sequence from starbursts to fully quenched post-starbursts (QPSBs) in the narrow mass range log M ( M ☉ ) = 10.3-10.7, and identifies "transiting" post-starbursts (TPSBs) which are intermediate between these two populations. In this mass range, ~0.3% of galaxies are starbursts, ~0.1% are QPSBs, and ~0.5% are the transiting types in between. The TPSBs have stellar properties that are predicted for fast-quenching starbursts and morphological characteristics that are already typical of early-type galaxies. The active galactic nucleus (AGN) fraction, as estimated from optical line ratios, of these post-starbursts is about three times higher ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 36% ± 8%) than that of normal star forming galaxies of the same mass, but there is a significant delay between the starburst phase and the peak of nuclear optical AGN activity (median age difference of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 200 ± 100 Myr), in agreement with previous studies. The time delay is inferred by comparing the broadband near-NUV-to-optical photometry with stellar population synthesis models. We also find that starbursts and post-starbursts are significantly more dust obscured than normal star forming galaxies in the same mass range. About 20% of the starbursts and 15% of the TPSBs can be classified as "dust-obscured galaxies" (DOGs), with a near-UV-to-mid-IR flux ratio of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 900, while only 0.8% of normal galaxies are DOGs. The time delay between the starburst phase and AGN activity suggests that AGNs do not play a primary role in the original quenching of starbursts but may be responsible for quenching later low-level star formation by removing gas and dust during the post-starburst phase.},

  abstract = { Numerical simulations have become a major tool for understanding galaxy formation and evolution. Over the decades the field has made significant progress. It is now possible to simulate the formation of individual galaxies and galaxy populations from well-defined initial conditions with realistic abundances and global properties. An essential component of the calculation is to correctly estimate the inflow to and outflow from forming galaxies because observations indicating low formation efficiency and strong circumgalactic presence of gas are persuasive. Energetic “feedback” from massive stars and accreting supermassive black holes—generally unresolved in cosmological simulations—plays a major role in driving galactic outflows, which have been shown to regulate many aspects of galaxy evolution. A surprisingly large variety of plausible subresolution models succeeds in this exercise. They capture the essential characteristics of the problem, i.e., outflows regulating galactic gas flows, but their predictive power is limited. In this review, we focus on one major challenge for galaxy formation theory: to understand the underlying physical processes that regulate the structure of the interstellar medium, star formation, and the driving of galactic outflows. This requires accurate physical models and numerical simulations, which can precisely describe the multiphase structure of the interstellar medium on the currently unresolved few hundred parsec scales of large-scale cosmological simulations. Such models ultimately require the full accounting for the dominant cooling and heating processes, the radiation and winds from massive stars and accreting black holes, and an accurate treatment of supernova explosions as well as the nonthermal components of the interstellar medium like magnetic fields and cosmic rays. },

The data indicate that the high specific SF rates (SFRs) of many less massive galaxies do not represent late, irregular or recurrent, starbursts in evolved galaxies. They rather seem to reflect the onset (initial burst) of the dominant SF episode of galaxies, after which SF gradually declines on gigayear timescales to z = 0 and forms the bulk of a galaxy's M * . With decreasing mass, this onset of major SF shifts to decreasing z for an increasing fraction of galaxies ( staged galaxy formation ). This process may be an important component of the "downsizing" phenomenon. We find that the predominantly gradual decline of SFRs described by Noeske et al. can be reproduced by exponential SF histories ( τ models ), if less massive galaxies have systematically longer e -folding times τ, and a later onset of SF ( z f ). Our model can provide a first parameterization of SFR as a function of M * and z , and quantify mass dependences of τ and z f , from direct observations of M * and SFRs up to z > 1. The observed evolution of SF in galaxies can plausibly reflect the dominance of gradual gas exhaustion. The data are also consistent with the history of cosmological accretion onto dark matter halos.},

  abstract  = {The role of disc instabilities, such as bars and spiral arms, and the associated resonances, in growing bulges in the inner regions of disc galaxies have long been studied in the low-redshift nearby Universe. There it has long been probed observationally, in particular through peanut-shaped bulges (Chap.                   14                                  ). This secular growth of bulges in modern disc galaxies is driven by weak, non-axisymmetric instabilities: it mostly produces pseudobulges at slow rates and with long star-formation timescales. Disc instabilities at high redshift (z{\thinspace}>{\thinspace}1) in moderate-mass to massive galaxies (1010 to a few 1011{\thinspace}M⊙ of stars) are very different from those found in modern spiral galaxies. High-redshift discs are globally unstable and fragment into giant clumps containing 108−9{\thinspace}M⊙ of gas and stars each, which results in highly irregular galaxy morphologies. The clumps and other features associated to the violent instability drive disc evolution and bulge growth through various mechanisms on short timescales. The giant clumps can migrate inward and coalesce into the bulge in a few 108 years. The instability in the very turbulent media drives intense gas inflows toward the bulge and nuclear region. Thick discs and supermassive black holes can grow concurrently as a result of the violent instability. This chapter reviews the properties of high-redshift disc instabilities, the evolution of giant clumps and other features associated to the instability, and the resulting growth of bulges and associated sub-galactic components.},

  abstract = {Disk galaxies at high redshift ( z ~ 2) are characterized by high fractions of cold gas, strong turbulence, and giant star-forming clumps. Major mergers of disk galaxies at high redshift should then generally involve such turbulent clumpy disks. Merger simulations, however, model the interstellar medium as a stable, homogeneous, and thermally pressurized medium. We present the first merger simulations with high fractions of cold, turbulent, and clumpy gas. We discuss the major new features of these models compared to models where the gas is artificially stabilized and warmed. Gas turbulence, which is already strong in high-redshift disks, is further enhanced in mergers. Some phases are dispersion dominated, with most of the gas kinetic energy in the form of velocity dispersion and very chaotic velocity fields, unlike merger models using a thermally stabilized gas. These mergers can reach very high star formation rates, and have multi-component gas spectra consistent with SubMillimeter Galaxies. Major mergers with high fractions of cold turbulent gas are also characterized by highly dissipative gas collapse to the center of mass, with the stellar component following in a global contraction. The final galaxies are early type with relatively small radii and high Sersic indices, like high-redshift compact spheroids. The mass fraction in a disk component that survives or re-forms after a merger is severely reduced compared to models with stabilized gas, and the formation of a massive disk component would require significant accretion of external baryons afterwards. Mergers thus appear to destroy extended disks even when the gas fraction is high, and this lends further support to smooth infall as the main formation mechanism for massive disk galaxies.},

Furthermore, the high density (~2 × 10 10 M ☉ kpc −3 ) of massive galaxies at these redshifts, which are similar to present-day globular clusters, possibly makes any further evolution in sizes beyond z = 3 unlikely.},

  abstract = {The increasing abundance of passive "red-sequence" galaxies since z ~ 1-2 is mirrored by a coincident rise in the number of galaxies with spheroidal morphologies. In this paper, however, we show in detail, that, the correspondence between galaxy morphology and color is not perfect, providing insight into the physical origin of this evolution. Using the COSMOS survey, we study a significant population of red-sequence galaxies with disk-like morphologies. These passive disks typically have Sa-Sb morphological types with large bulges, but they are not confined to dense environments. They represent nearly one-half of all red-sequence galaxies and dominate at lower masses ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 10 10 M ☉ ) where they are increasingly disk-dominated. As a function of time, the abundance of passive disks with M * ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 10 11 M ☉ increases, but not as fast as red-sequence spheroidals in the same mass range. At higher mass, the passive disk population has declined since z ~ 1, likely because they transform into spheroidals. Based on these trends, we estimate that as much as 60% of galaxies transitioning onto the red sequence evolve through a passive disk phase. The origin of passive disks therefore has broad implications for our understanding of how star formation shuts down. Because passive disks tend to be more bulge-dominated than their star-forming counterparts, a simple fading of blue disks does not fully explain their origin. We explore the strengths and weaknesses of several more sophisticated explanations, including environmental effects, internal stabilization, and disk regrowth during gas-rich mergers. While previous work has sought to explain color and morphological transformations with a single process, these observations open the way to new insight by highlighting the fact that galaxy evolution may actually proceed through several separate stages.},

  abstract = {Projected axis ratio measurements of 880 early-type galaxies at redshifts 1 < z < 2.5 selected from CANDELS are used to reconstruct and model their intrinsic shapes. The sample is selected on the basis of multiple rest-frame colors to reflect low star-formation activity. We demonstrate that these galaxies as an ensemble are dust-poor and transparent and therefore likely have smooth light profiles, similar to visually classified early-type galaxies. Similar to their present-day counterparts, the z > 1 early-type galaxies show a variety of intrinsic shapes; even at a fixed mass, the projected axis ratio distributions cannot be explained by the random projection of a set of galaxies with very similar intrinsic shapes. However, a two-population model for the intrinsic shapes, consisting of a triaxial, fairly round population, combined with a flat ( c / a ~ 0.3) oblate population, adequately describes the projected axis ratio distributions of both present-day and z > 1 early-type galaxies. We find that the proportion of oblate versus triaxial galaxies depends both on the galaxies' stellar mass, and—at a given mass—on redshift. For present-day and z < 1 early-type galaxies the oblate fraction strongly depends on galaxy mass. At z > 1, this trend is much weaker over the mass range explored here (10 10 < M * / M ☉ < 10 11 ), because the oblate fraction among massive ( M * ~ 10 11 M ☉ ) was much higher in the past: 0.59 ± 0.10 at z > 1, compared to 0.20 ± 0.02 at z ~ 0.1. When combined with previous findings that the number density and sizes of early-type galaxies substantially increase over the same redshift range, this can be explained by the gradual emergence of merger-produced elliptical galaxies, at the expense of the destruction of pre-existing disks that were common among their high-redshift progenitors. In contrast, the oblate fraction among low-mass early-type galaxies (log ( M * / M ☉ ) < 10.5) increased toward the present, from z = 0 to 0.38 ± 0.11 at z > 1 to 0.72 ± 0.06 at z = 0. We speculate that this lower incidence of disks at early cosmic times can be attributed to two factors: low-mass, star-forming progenitors at z > 1 were not settled into stable disks to the same degree as at later cosmic times, and the stripping of gas from star-forming disk galaxies in dense environments is an increasingly important process at lower redshifts.},

  abstract = {The shutdown of star formation in galaxies is generally termed "quenching." Quenching may occur through a variety of processes, e.g., active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, stellar feedback, or the shock heating of gas in the dark matter halo. However, which mechanism(s) is, in fact, responsible for quenching is still in question. This paper addresses quenching by searching for traces of possible quenching processes through their effects on galaxy structural parameters such as stellar mass ( M * ), M * / r e , surface stellar mass density (~ M * / r 2 e ), and Sérsic index ( n ). We analyze the rest-frame U – B color correlations versus these structural parameters using a sample of galaxies in the redshift range 0.5 ≤ z < 0.8 from the DEEP2/AEGIS survey. In addition to global radii, stellar masses, and Sérsic parameters, we also use "bulge" and "disk" photometric measurements from GIM2D fits to HST /ACS V and I images. We assess the tightness of the color relationships by measuring their "overlap regions," defined as the area in color-parameter space in which red and blue galaxies overlap; the parameter that minimizes these overlap regions is considered to be the most effective color discriminator. We find that Sérsic index ( n ) has the smallest overlap region among all tested parameters and resembles a step function with a threshold value of n = 2.3. There exists, however, a significant population of outliers with blue colors yet high n values that seem to contradict this behavior; they make up ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 40% of n > 2.3 galaxies. We hypothesize that their Sérsic values may be distorted by bursts of star formation, AGNs, and/or poor fits, leading us to consider central surface stellar mass density , Σ* 1 kpc , as an alternative to Sérsic index. Not only does Σ* 1 kpc correct the outliers, but it also forms a tight relationship with color, suggesting that the innermost structure of galaxies is most physically linked with quenching . Furthermore, at z ~ 0.65, the majority of the blue cloud galaxies cannot simply fade onto the red sequence since their GIM2D bulge masses are only half as large on average as the bulge masses of similar red sequence galaxies, thus demonstrating that stellar mass must absolutely increase at the centers of galaxies as they quench. We discuss a two-stage model for quenching in which galaxy star formation rates are controlled by their dark halos while they are still in the blue cloud and a second quenching process sets in later, associated with the central stellar mass buildup. The mass buildup is naturally explained by any non-axisymmetric features in the potential, such as those induced by mergers and/or disk instabilities. However, the identity of the second quenching agent is still unknown. We have placed our data catalog online.},

Our analysis is based on a homogeneous synthesis of published data from 16 spectroscopic surveys observed at similar spatial resolution, augmented by new measurements for galaxies in the Gemini Deep Deep Survey. In total, our sample contains structural data for 465 galaxies (mainly early-type) in the redshift range 0.2 < z < 2.7. The size evolution of passively evolving galaxies over this redshift range is gradual and continuous, with no evidence for an end or change to the process around z ~ 1, as has been hinted at by some surveys which analyze subsets of the data in isolation. The size growth appears to be independent of stellar mass, with the mass-normalized half-light radius scaling with redshift as R e ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} (1 + z ) –1.62 ± 0.34 . Surprisingly, this power law seems to be in good agreement with the recently reported continuous size evolution of UV-bright galaxies in the redshift range z ~ 0.5-3.5.

  abstract = {The dense interiors of massive galaxies are among the most intriguing environments in the universe. In this paper,we ask when these dense cores were formed and determine how galaxies gradually assembled around them. We select galaxies that have a stellar mass >3 × 10 10 M ☉ inside r = 1 kpc out to z = 2.5, using the 3D-HST survey and data at low redshift. Remarkably, the number density of galaxies with dense cores appears to have decreased from z = 2.5 to the present. This decrease is probably mostly due to stellar mass loss and the resulting adiabatic expansion, with some contribution from merging. We infer that dense cores were mostly formed at z > 2.5, consistent with their largely quiescent stellar populations. While the cores appear to form early, the galaxies in which they reside show strong evolution: their total masses increase by a factor of 2-3 from z = 2.5 to z = 0 and their effective radii increase by a factor of 5-6. As a result, the contribution of dense cores to the total mass of the galaxies in which they reside decreases from ~50% at z = 2.5 to ~15% at z = 0. Because of their early formation, the contribution of dense cores to the total stellar mass budget of the universe is a strong function of redshift. The stars in cores with M 1 kpc > 3 × 10 10 M ☉ make up ~0.1% of the stellar mass density of the universe today but 10%-20% at z ~ 2, depending on their initial mass function. The formation of these cores required the conversion of ~10 11 M ☉ of gas into stars within ~1 kpc, while preventing significant star formation at larger radii.},

  abstract = {Morphological and spectroscopic studies of high-redshift clusters indicate that a significant fraction of present-day, early-type galaxies was transformed from star-forming galaxies at z < 1. On the other hand, the slow luminosity evolution of early-type galaxies and the low scatter in their color-magnitude relation indicate a high formation redshift of their stars. In this paper we construct models that reconcile these apparently contradictory lines of evidence, and we quantify the effects of morphological evolution on the observed photometric properties of early-type galaxies in distant clusters. We show that in the case of strong morphological evolution the apparent luminosity and color evolution of early-type galaxies are similar to those of a single-age stellar population formed at z = ∞, irrespective of the true star formation history of the galaxies. Furthermore, the scatter in age, and hence the scatter in color and luminosity, is approximately constant with redshift. These results are consequences of the "progenitor bias": the progenitors of the youngest low-redshift, early-type galaxies drop out of the sample at high redshift. We construct models that reproduce the observed evolution of the number fraction of early-type galaxies in rich clusters and their color and luminosity evolution simultaneously. Our modeling indicates that ~50% of early-type galaxies were transformed from other galaxy types at z < 1, and their progenitor galaxies may have had roughly constant star formation rates prior to morphological transformation. The effect of the progenitor bias on the evolution of the mean M / L ratio and color can be estimated. The progenitor bias is a linear function of the scatter in the color-magnitude relation produced by age variations and is maximal if the observed scatter is entirely due to age differences. After correcting the observed evolution of the mean M / L B ratio for the maximum progenitor bias, we find that the mean luminosity-weighted formation redshift of stars in early-type galaxies ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lang.gif] {lang} z * ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rang.gif] {rang} = 3.0 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/553/1/90/img1.gif] {img1.gif} for Ω m = 0.3 and Ω Λ = 0 and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lang.gif] {lang} z * ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rang.gif] {rang} = 2.0 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/553/1/90/img2.gif] {img2.gif} for Ω m = 0.3 and Ω Λ = 0.7. Our analysis places the star formation epoch of early-type galaxies later than previous studies, which ignored the effects of progenitor bias. The results are consistent with the idea that (some) Lyman break galaxies are star-forming building blocks of massive early-type galaxies in clusters.},

  abstract = {Gas-rich disks in the early universe are highly turbulent and have giant star-forming clumps. Models suggest that the clumps form by gravitational instabilities, and if they resist disruption by star formation, then they interact, lose angular momentum, and migrate to the center to form a bulge. Here we study the properties of the bulges formed by this mechanism. They are all thick, slowly rotating, and have a high Sersic index, like classical bulges. Their rapid formation should also give them relatively high α-element abundances. We consider fourteen low-resolution models and four high-resolution models, three of which have supernova feedback. All models have an active halo, stellar disk, and gaseous disk; three of the models have a pre-existing bulge, and three others have a cuspy dark matter halo. All show the same basic result except the one with the highest feedback, in which the clumps are quickly destroyed and the disk thickens too much. The coalescence of massive disk clumps in the center of a galaxy is like a major merger in terms of orbital mixing. It differs by leaving a bulge with no specific dark matter component, unlike the merger of individual galaxies. Normal supernova feedback has little effect, because the high turbulent speed in the gas produces tightly bound clumps. A variety of indirect observations support the model, including clumpy disks with young bulges at high redshift and bulges with relatively little dark matter.},

By phenomenologically implementing the winds that are observed from high-redshift galaxies and in particular from individual clumps, our simulations reproduce well new observational constraints on clump kinematics and clump ages. In particular, the observation that older clumps appear closer to their galaxy centers is reproduced in our simulations, as a result of inside-out formation of the disks rather than inward clump migration.},

Our laser guide star adaptive optics and good seeing data show the presence of turbulent rotating star-forming outer rings/disks, plus central bulge/inner disk components, whose mass fractions relative to the total dynamical mass appear to scale with the [N II]/Hα flux ratio and the star formation age. We propose that the buildup of the central disks and bulges of massive galaxies at z ~ 2 can be driven by the early secular evolution of gas-rich proto-disks. High-redshift disks exhibit large random motions. This turbulence may in part be stirred up by the release of gravitational energy in the rapid "cold" accretion flows along the filaments of the cosmic web. As a result, dynamical friction and viscous processes proceed on a timescale of <1 Gyr, at least an order of magnitude faster than in z ~ 0 disk galaxies. Early secular evolution thus drives gas and stars into the central regions and can build up exponential disks and massive bulges, even without major mergers. Secular evolution along with increased efficiency of star formation at high surface densities may also help to account for the short timescales of the stellar buildup observed in massive galaxies at z ~ 2.},

  abstract = {We have measured the radial profiles of isophotal ellipticity ( ε ) and disky/boxy parameter A 4 out to radii of about three times the semimajor axes for ∼4600 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) between redshift 0.5 and 1.8 in the CANDELS/GOODS-S and UDS fields. Based on the average size–mass relation in each redshift bin, we divide our galaxies at a given mass into Small SFGs (SSFGs; smaller than the average) and Large SFGs (LSFGs; larger than the average). We show that, at low masses ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/854/1/70/apjaaa5adieqn1.gif] {${M}_{* }\lt {10}^{10}{M}_{\odot }$} ), the SSFGs generally have nearly flat ε and A 4 profiles in both edge-on and face-on views, especially at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/854/1/70/apjaaa5adieqn2.gif] {$z\gt 1$} . Moreover, the median A 4 values at all radii are almost zero. In contrast, the highly inclined low-mass LSFGs in the same mass-redshift bins generally have monotonically increasing ε profiles with radius and disky feature dominated in the intermediate regions. These findings imply that at these redshifts, the low-mass SSFGs are not disk-like, whereas the low-mass LSFGs likely harbour disk-like components flattened by significant rotations. At high masses ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/854/1/70/apjaaa5adieqn3.gif] {${M}_{* }\gt {10}^{10}{M}_{\odot }$} ), both highly inclined SSFGs and LSFGs generally exhibit distinct trends in both ε and A 4 profiles, which increase at lower radii, reach maxima, then decrease at larger radii. Such the feature is more prevalent for more massive ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/854/1/70/apjaaa5adieqn4.gif] {${M}_{* }\gt {10}^{10.5}{M}_{\odot }$} ) galaxies or at lower redshifts ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/854/1/70/apjaaa5adieqn5.gif] {$z\lt 1.4$} ). This feature can be simply explained if galaxies possess all three components: central bulges, disks in the intermediate regions, and halo-like stellar components in the outskirts.},

For the first time, we fit two-dimensional models comprising a single Sérsic fit and two-component (i.e., bulge + disk) decompositions not only to the H -band light distributions, but also to the stellar mass maps reconstructed from resolved stellar population modeling. We confirm that the increased bulge prominence among quiescent galaxies, as reported previously based on rest-optical observations, remains in place when considering the distributions of stellar mass. Moreover, we observe an increase of the typical Sérsic index and bulge-to-total ratio (with median B / T reaching 40%-50%) among star-forming galaxies above 10 11 M ☉ . Given that quenching for these most massive systems is likely to be imminent, our findings suggest that significant bulge growth precedes a departure from the star-forming main sequence. We demonstrate that the bulge mass (and ideally knowledge of the bulge and total mass) is a more reliable predictor of the star-forming versus quiescent state of a galaxy than the total stellar mass. The same trends are predicted by the state-of-the-art, semi-analytic model by Somerville et al. In this model, bulges and black holes grow hand in hand through merging and/or disk instabilities, and feedback from active galactic nuclei shuts off star formation. Further observations will be required to pin down star formation quenching mechanisms, but our results imply that they must be internal to the galaxies and closely associated with bulge growth.},

Almost all of these galaxies appear to be relaxed systems, with smooth morphologies at both rest-frame UV and visible wavelengths. Previous results from spectral synthesis modeling favor a single burst of star formation more than 1 Gyr before the observed epoch. The prevalence of old stellar populations, however, does not correlate exclusively with early-type morphologies as it does in the local universe; the light profiles for some of these galaxies appear to be dominated by massive exponential disks. This evidence for massive old disks, along with the apparent uniformity of stellar age across the disk, suggests formation by a mechanism better described as a form of monolithic collapse than as a hierarchical merger. These galaxies could not have undergone a single major merging event since the bulk of their stars were formed, more than 1 Gyr earlier. There is at least one case, however, that appears to be undergoing a "dry merger," which may be an example of the process that converts these unusual galaxies into the familiar spheroids that dominate galaxies comprising old stellar populations at the present epoch.},

  abstract    = {We use 25 simulated galaxies from the NIHAO project to define and characterize a variety of kinematic stellar structures: thin and thick discs, large scale single discs, classical and pseudo bulges, spheroids, inner discs, and stellar haloes. These structures have masses, spins, shapes and rotational support in good agreement with theoretical expectations and observational data. Above a dark matter halo mass of $2.5\times10^{\rm~11}M_{\rm\odot}$, all galaxies have a classical bulge and 70\% have a thin and thick disc. The kinematic (thin) discs follow a power-law relation between azimuthal angular momentum and stellar mass $J_z\sim~M_{\rm~*}^{\rm1.25\pm0.06}$, with an exponent slightly smaller that the theoretically predicted value of $5/3$, and show a strong correlation between maximum `observed' rotation velocity and dark matter halo circular velocity. Tracing back in time these structures' progenitors, we find all to lose a fraction $1-f_j$ of their maximum angular momentum. Thin discs are significantly better at retaining their high-redshift spins ($f_j\sim0.70$) than thick ones ($f_j\sim0.40$). Stellar haloes have their progenitor baryons assembled the latest ($z_{\rm~1/2}\sim1.1$) and over the longest timescales ($\tau\sim6.2$~Gyr), and have the smallest fraction of stars born in-situ ($f_{\rm in-situ}=0.35\pm0.14$).

We find a large variety of galaxy morphologies, ranging from large, blue, disk-like galaxies to compact, red, early-type galaxies. We derive rest-frame u – g color profiles for these galaxies and show that most z ~ 2 galaxies in our sample have negative color gradients such that their cores are red. Although these color gradients may partly be caused by radial variations in dust content, they point to the existence of older stellar populations in the centers of z ~ 2 galaxies. This result is consistent with an "inside-out" scenario of galaxy growth. We find that the median color gradient is fairly constant with redshift: (Δ( u – g rest )/Δ(log r )) median = –0.47, –0.33, and –0.46 for z ~ 2, z ~ 1, and z = 0, respectively. Using structural parameters derived from surface brightness profiles we confirm that at z ~ 2 galaxy morphology correlates well with specific star formation rate. At the same mass, star-forming galaxies have larger effective radii, bluer rest-frame u – g colors, and lower Sérsic indices than quiescent galaxies. These correlations are very similar to those at lower redshift, suggesting that the relations that give rise to the Hubble sequence at z = 0 are already in place for massive galaxies at this early epoch.},

When M star is fixed we see that strong trends remain with all other parameters, whereas residual trends are weaker when Σ, n , or σ is fixed. Overall σ is the best indicator of a galaxy's typical color, showing the largest residual color dependence when any of the other three parameters are fixed, and M star is the poorest. Other studies have indicated that both the central black hole mass and possibly host dark matter halo properties (mass or concentration) are also better correlated with σ than with M star , Σ, or n . Therefore, it could be the case that the strong correlation between color and σ reflects an underlying relationship between a galaxy's star formation history and/or present star formation rate and the properties of its dark matter halo and/or the feedback from its central supermassive black hole.},

Using one of the deepest large public near-IR surveys to date, we investigate in detail the correlations between star formation and galaxy structural parameters (size, stellar mass, and surface density) from z = 2 to the present. At all redshifts, massive quiescent galaxies (i.e., those with little or no star formation) occupy the extreme high end of the surface density distribution and follow a tight mass-size correlation, while star-forming galaxies show a broad range of both densities and sizes. Conversely, galaxies with the highest surface densities comprise a nearly homogeneous population with little or no ongoing star formation, while less dense galaxies exhibit high star formation rates and varying levels of dust obscuration. Both the sizes and surface densities of quiescent galaxies evolve strongly from z = 2-0; we parameterize this evolution for both populations with simple power-law functions and present best-fit parameters for comparison to future theoretical models. Higher-mass quiescent galaxies undergo faster structural evolution, consistent with previous results. Interestingly, star-forming galaxies' sizes and densities evolve at rates similar to those of quiescent galaxies. It is therefore possible that the same physical processes drive the structural evolution of both populations, suggesting that "dry mergers" may not be the sole culprit in this size evolution.},

Structural measurements for all but the z ~ 0.1 galaxies are based on Hubble Space Telescope imaging, and SFRs are derived using a Herschel -calibrated ladder of SFR indicators. We find that a correlation between the structure and stellar population of galaxies (i.e., a "Hubble sequence") is already in place since at least z ~ 2.5. At all epochs, typical star-forming galaxies on the main sequence are well approximated by exponential disks, while the profiles of quiescent galaxies are better described by de Vaucouleurs profiles. In the upper envelope of the main sequence, the relation between the SFR and Sérsic index reverses, suggesting a rapid buildup of the central mass concentration in these starbursting outliers. We observe quiescent, moderately and highly star-forming systems to co-exist over an order of magnitude or more in stellar mass. At each mass and redshift, galaxies on the main sequence have the largest size. The rate of size growth correlates with specific SFR, and so does Σ SFR at each redshift. A simple model using an empirically determined star formation law and metallicity scaling, in combination with an assumed geometry for dust and stars, is able to relate the observed Σ SFR and SFR IR /SFR UV , provided a more patchy dust geometry is assumed for high-redshift galaxies.},

Using the BzK selection criterion, we have preselected a set of objects over the UDF, which fulfill the photometric conditions for being passively evolving galaxies at z > 1.4. Low-resolution spectra of these objects have been extracted from the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) ACS grism data taken over the UDF by the Grism ACS Program for Extragalactic Science (GRAPES) project. Redshifts for the seven galaxies have been identified based on the UV feature at rest frame 2640 < λ < 2850 Å. This feature is mainly due to a combination of Fe II , Mg I , and Mg II absorptions, which are characteristic of stellar populations dominated by stars older than ~0.5 Gyr. The redshift identification and the passively evolving nature of these galaxies is further supported by the photometric redshifts and by the overall spectral energy distribution (SED), with the ultradeep HST ACS NICMOS imaging revealing compact morphologies typical of elliptical/early-type galaxies. From the SED we derive stellar masses of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {gtrsim} 10 11 M ☉ and ages of ~1 Gyr. Their space density at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lang.gif] {lang} z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rang.gif] {rang} = 1.7 appears to be roughly a factor of 2-3 smaller than that of their local counterparts, further supporting the notion that such massive and old galaxies are already ubiquitous at early cosmic times. Much smaller effective radii are derived for some of the objects, compared to local massive ellipticals, which may be due to morphological K -corrections, evolution, or the presence of a central pointlike source. Nuclear activity is indeed present in a subset of the galaxies, as revealed by the fact that they are hard X-ray sources, which suggests that active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity may have played a role in discontinuing star formation.},

The criteria are thoroughly tested with theoretical stellar population synthesis models and real galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts to evaluate their efficiency and contamination. We apply the well-tested VJL criteria to the HST /WFC3 Early Release Science field and study the physical properties of selected galaxies. The redshift distribution of selected SFGs peaks at z ~ 2.7, slightly lower than that of Lyman break galaxies at z ~ 3. Comparing the observed mid-infrared fluxes of selected galaxies with the prediction of pure stellar emission, we find that our VJL method is effective at selecting massive dusty SFGs that are missed by the Lyman break technique. About half of the star formation in massive ( M star > 10 10 M ☉ ) galaxies at 2.3 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 3.5 is contributed by dusty (extinction E ( B – V ) > 0.4) SFGs, which, however, only account for ~20% of the number density of massive SFGs. We also use the mid-infrared fluxes to clean our PEG sample and find that galaxy size can be used as a secondary criterion to effectively eliminate the contamination of dusty SFGs. The redshift distribution of the cleaned PEG sample peaks at z ~ 2.5. We find six PEG candidates at z > 3 and discuss possible methods to distinguish them from dusty contamination. We conclude that at least part of our candidates are real PEGs at z ~ 3, implying that these types of galaxies began to form their stars at z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 5. We measure the integrated stellar mass density (ISMD) of PEGs at z ~ 2.5 and set constraints on it at z > 3.

The number density of local compact galaxies with luminosity weighted (LW) ages compatible with being already passive at high redshift is compared with the density of compact passive galaxies observed at high- z . Our results place an upper limit of a factor ~2 on the evolution of the number density and are inconsistent with a significant size evolution for most of the compact galaxies observed at high- z . Instead, the evolution may be significant (up to a factor five) for the most extreme, ultracompact galaxies. Considering all compact galaxies, regardless of LW age and star formation activity, a minority of local compact galaxies (≤1/3) might have formed at z < 1. Finally, we show that the secular decrease of the galaxy stellar mass due to simple stellar evolution may in some cases be a non-negligible factor in the context of the evolution of the mass-size relation, and we caution that passive evolution in mass should be taken into account when comparing samples at different redshifts.},

  abstract = {The DEEP2 and COMBO-17 surveys are compared to study luminosity functions of red and blue galaxies to z\~{}1. The two surveys have different methods and sensitivities, but nevertheless results agree. After z\~{}1, M$^{*}$$_{B}$ has dimmed by 1.2-1.3 mag for all colors of galaxies, {\phis}$^{*}$ for blue galaxies has hardly changed, and {\phis}$^{*}$ for red galaxies has at least doubled (our formal value is \~{}0.5 dex). Luminosity density j$_{B}$ has fallen by 0.6 dex for blue galaxies but has remained nearly constant for red galaxies. These results imply that the number and total stellar mass of blue galaxies have been substantially constant since z\~{}1, whereas those of red galaxies (near L$^{*}$) have been significantly rising. To explain the new red galaxies, a ``mixed'' scenario is proposed in which star formation in blue cloud galaxies is quenched, causing them to migrate to the red sequence, where they merge further in a small number of stellar mergers. This mixed scenario matches the local boxy-disky transition for nearby ellipticals, as well as red sequence stellar population scaling laws such as the color-magnitude and Mg-{$\sigma$} relations (which are explained as fossil relics from blue progenitors). Blue galaxies enter the red sequence via different quenching modes, each of which peaks at a different characteristic mass and time. The red sequence therefore likely builds up in different ways at different times and masses, and the concept of a single process that is ``downsizing'' (or upsizing) probably does not apply. Our claim in this paper of a rise in the number of red galaxies applies to galaxies near L$^{*}$. Accurate counts of brighter galaxies on the steep part of the Schechter function require more accurate photometry than is currently available.  Based on observations taken at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated jointly by the University of California and the California Institute of Technology, and on observations made with the NASA/ESO Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the data archives at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555, and from the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre.},

Comparisons of the K s -selected star-forming galaxy SMFs with UV-selected SMFs at 2.5 < z < 4 show reasonable agreement and suggest that UV-selected samples are representative of the majority of the stellar mass density at z > 3.5. We estimate the average mass growth of individual galaxies by selecting galaxies at fixed cumulative number density. The average galaxy with log( M star / M ☉ ) = 11.5 at z = 0.3 has grown in mass by only 0.2 dex (0.3 dex) since z = 2.0 (3.5), whereas those with log( M star / M ☉ ) = 10.5 have grown by >1.0 dex since z = 2. At z < 2, the time derivatives of the mass growth are always larger for lower-mass galaxies, which demonstrates that the mass growth in galaxies since that redshift is mass-dependent and primarily bottom-up. Lastly, we examine potential sources of systematic uncertainties in the SMFs and find that those from photo- z templates, stellar population synthesis modeling, and the definition of quiescent galaxies dominate the total error budget in the SMFs.},

ZFOURGE provides well-constrained photometric redshifts made possible through deep medium-bandwidth imaging at 1-2 μm. We combine this with Hubble Space Telescope imaging from the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey, allowing for the efficient selection of both blue and red galaxies down to stellar masses of ~10 9.5 M ☉ at z ~ 2.5. The total surveyed area is 316 arcmin 2 distributed over three independent fields. We supplement these data with the wider and shallower NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey to provide stronger constraints at high masses. Several studies at z ≤ 1.5 have revealed a steepening of the slope at the low-mass end of the SMF, leading to an upturn at masses <10 10 M ☉ that is not well described by a standard single-Schechter function. We find evidence that this feature extends to at least z ~ 2 and that it can be found in both the star-forming and quiescent populations individually. The characteristic mass ( M *) and slope at the lowest masses (α) of a double-Schechter function fit to the SMF stay roughly constant at Log( M / M ☉ ) ~ 10.65 and ~ – 1.5, respectively. The SMF of star-forming galaxies has evolved primarily in normalization, while the change in shape is relatively minor. Our data allow us, for the first time, to observe a rapid buildup at the low-mass end of the quiescent SMF. Since z = 2.5, the total stellar mass density of quiescent galaxies (down to 10 9 M ☉ ) has increased by a factor of ~12, whereas the mass density of star-forming galaxies only increases by a factor of ~2.2.},

We take these findings—which suggest that quenching is the natural downturn of all SFHs affecting galaxies at rates/times correlated with their densities—to mean that: (1) models in which galaxies are diversified on Hubble timescales by something like initial conditions rival the dominant grow-and-quench framework as good descriptions of the data; or (2) absent spatial information, many metrics of galaxy evolution are too undiscriminating—if not inherently misleading—to confirm a unique explanation. We outline future tests of our model but stress that, even if ultimately incorrect, it illustrates how exploring different paradigms can aid learning and, we hope, more detailed modeling efforts.},

We combine the infrared data with redshifts, rest-frame luminosities, and colors from COMBO-17 and with morphologies from Hubble Space Telescope images collected by the Galaxy Evolution from Morphology and SEDs (GEMS) and Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) projects. To characterize the decline in star formation rate (SFR) since z ~ 0.7, we estimate the total thermal IR luminosities, SFRs, and stellar masses for the galaxies in this sample. At z ~ 0.7, nearly 40% of intermediate- and high-mass galaxies (with stellar masses ≥2 × 10 10 M ☉ ) are undergoing a period of intense star formation above their past-averaged SFR. In contrast, less than 1% of equally massive galaxies in the local universe have similarly intense star formation activity. Morphologically undisturbed galaxies dominate the total infrared luminosity density and SFR density: at z ~ 0.7, more than half of the intensely star-forming galaxies have spiral morphologies, whereas less than ~30% are strongly interacting. Thus, a decline in major merger rate is not the underlying cause of the rapid decline in cosmic SFR since z ~ 0.7. Physical properties that do not strongly affect galaxy morphology—for example, gas consumption and weak interactions with small satellite galaxies—appear to be responsible.},

  abstract = {The mid-infrared local luminosity function is evolved with redshift to fit the spectrum of the cosmic infrared background (CIRB) at λ > 5 μm and the galaxy counts from various surveys at mid-infrared, far-infrared, and submillimeter wavelengths. A variety of evolutionary models provide satisfactory fits to the CIRB and the number counts. The degeneracy in the range of models cannot be broken by current observations. However, the different evolutionary models yield approximately the same comoving number density of infrared luminous galaxies as a function of redshift. Since the spectrum of the cosmic background at λ > 200 μm is quite sensitive to the evolution at high redshift, i.e., z > 1, all models that fit the counts require a flattening at z ~ 0.8 to avoid overproducing the CIRB. About 80% of the 140 μm CIRB is produced at 0 < z < 1.5, while only about 30% of the 850 μm background is produced within the same redshift range. The nature of the evolution is then translated into a measure of the dust-enshrouded star formation rate (SFR) density as a function of redshift and compared with estimates from rest-frame optical/ultraviolet surveys. The dust-enshrouded SFR density appears to peak at z = 0.8 ± 0.1, much sooner than previously thought, with a value of 0.25 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/556/2/562/img1.gif] {img1.gif} M ☉ yr -1 Mpc -3 , and remains almost constant up to z ~ 2. At least 70% of this star formation takes place in infrared luminous galaxies with L IR > 10 11 L ☉ . The long-wavelength observations that constrain our evolutionary models do not strongly trace the evolution at z > 2 and a drop-off in the dust-enshrouded SFR density is consistent with both the CIRB spectrum and the number counts. However, a comparison with the infrared luminosity function derived from extinction-corrected rest-frame optical/ultraviolet observations of the Lyman break galaxy population at z ~ 3 suggests that the almost flat comoving SFR density seen between redshifts of 0.8 and 2 extends up to a redshift of z ~ 4.},

Galaxies with reliable signs of SF form a distinct "main sequence" (MS), with a limited range of SFRs at a given M * and z (1 σ ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} ±0.3 dex), and log(SFR) approximately proportional to log M * . The range of log(SFR) remains constant to z > 1, while the MS as a whole moves to higher SFR as z increases. The range of the SFR along the MS constrains the amplitude of episodic variations of SF and the effect of mergers on the SFR. Typical galaxies spend ~67%(95%) of their lifetime since z = 1 within a factor of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} 2(4) of their average SFR at a given M * and z . The dominant mode of the evolution of SF since z ~ 1 is apparently a gradual decline of the average SFR in most individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of starburst episodes, or a decreasing factor by which SFRs are enhanced in starbursts. LIRGs at z ~ 1 seem to mostly reflect the high SFR typical for massive galaxies at that epoch. The smooth MS may reflect that the same set of few physical processes governs SF prior to additional quenching processes. A gradual process like gas exhaustion may play a dominant role.},

Two similarly bright sources are also detected in a reanalysis of the GOODS-S data set. Three of the four galaxies in GOODS-N are significantly detected at 4.5σ-6.2σ in the very deep Spitzer /IRAC 4.5 μm data, as is one of the GOODS-S candidates. Furthermore, the brightest of our candidates (at z = 10.2 ± 0.4) is robustly detected also at 3.6 μm (6.9σ), revealing a flat UV spectral energy distribution with a slope β = –2.0 ± 0.2, consistent with demonstrated trends with luminosity at high redshift. Thorough testing and use of grism data excludes known low-redshift contamination at high significance, including single emission-line sources, but as-yet unknown low redshift sources could provide an alternative solution given the surprising luminosity of these candidates. Finding such bright galaxies at z ~ 9-10 suggests that the luminosity function for luminous galaxies might evolve in a complex way at z > 8. The cosmic star formation rate density still shows, however, an order-of-magnitude increase from z ~ 10 to z ~ 8 since the dominant contribution comes from low-luminosity sources. Based on the IRAC detections, we derive galaxy stellar masses at z ~ 10, finding that these luminous objects are typically 10 9 M ☉ .

The focus of this review is on the broad patterns in the star formation properties of galaxies along the Hubble sequence and their implications for understanding galaxy evolution and the physical processes that drive the evolution. Star formation in the disks and nuclear regions of galaxies are reviewed separately, then discussed within a common interpretive framework. The diagnostic methods used to measure SFRs are also reviewed, and a self-consistent set of SFR calibrations is presented as an aid to workers in the field. },

Typical massive galaxies in the distant Universe formed stars an order of magnitude more rapidly. Unless star formation was significantly more efficient, this difference suggests that young galaxies were much more molecular-gas rich. Molecular gas observations in the distant Universe have so far largely been restricted to very luminous, rare objects, including mergers and quasars, and accordingly we do not yet have a clear idea about the gas content of more normal (albeit massive) galaxies. Here we report the results of a survey of molecular gas in samples of typical massive-star-forming galaxies at mean redshifts $\lt$z$\gt$ of about 1.2 and 2.3, when the Universe was respectively 40\% and 24\% of its current age. Our measurements reveal that distant star forming galaxies were indeed gas rich, and that the star formation efficiency is not strongly dependent on cosmic epoch. The average fraction of cold gas relative to total galaxy baryonic mass at z = 2.3 and z = 1.2 is respectively about 44\% and 34\%, three to ten times higher than in today's massive spiral galaxies. The slow decrease between z\~{}2 and z\~{}1 probably requires a mechanism of semi-continuous replenishment of fresh gas to the young galaxies.},

Using data from the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE) in combination with far-IR imaging from the Spitzer and Herschel observatories we measure the SFR– M * relation at 0.5 < z < 4. Similar to recent works we find that the average infrared spectral energy distributions of galaxies are roughly consistent with a single infrared template across a broad range of redshifts and stellar masses, with evidence for only weak deviations.

We compare our measurements to results from state-of-the-art cosmological simulations, and find general agreement in the slope of the SFR– M * relation albeit with systematic offsets. We use the evolving SFR– M * sequence to generate SFHs, finding that typical SFRs of individual galaxies rise at early times and decline after reaching a peak. This peak occurs earlier for more massive galaxies. We integrate these SFHs to generate mass growth histories and compare to the implied mass growth from the evolution of the stellar mass function (SMF). We find that these two estimates are in broad qualitative agreement, but that there is room for improvement at a more detailed level. At early times the SFHs suggest mass growth rates that are as much as 10× higher than inferred from the SMF. However, at later times the SFHs under-predict the inferred evolution, as is expected in the case of additional growth due to mergers.},

However, in contrast with some simulations, there is only a weak relation between star formation rate (SFR) and size within the star-forming population: when dividing into quartiles based on residual offsets in SFR, we find that the sizes of star-forming galaxies in the lowest quartile are 0.27 ± 0.06 dex smaller than the highest quartile.

Taken together, these results suggest that there is an abrupt cessation of star formation after galaxies attain particular structural properties.

The remaining 28% comprises quiescent galaxies. Galaxies on the "normal" star formation sequence show strong trends of increasing dust attenuation with stellar mass and a decreasing specific SFR, with an observed scatter of 0.25 dex. The dusty, blue galaxies reside in the upper envelope of the star formation sequence with remarkably similar spectral shapes at all masses, suggesting that the same physical process is dominating the stellar light. The red, low-dust star-forming galaxies may be in the process of shutting off and migrating to the quiescent population.},

Our analysis uniquely combines U to 8 μm photometry from FIREWORKS, MIPS 24 μm and PACS 70, 100, and 160 μm photometry from the PEP, and H α spectroscopy from the SINS survey. We describe a set of conversions that lead to a continuity across SFR indicators. A luminosity-independent conversion from 24 μm to total infrared luminosity yields estimates of L IR that are in the median consistent with the L IR derived from PACS photometry, albeit with significant scatter. Dust correction methods perform well at low-to-intermediate levels of star formation. They fail to recover the total amount of star formation in systems with large SFR IR /SFR UV ratios, typically occuring at the highest SFRs (SFR UV + IR ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 100 M ☉ yr –1 ) and redshifts ( z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 2.5) probed. Finally, we confirm that H α-based SFRs at 1.5 < z < 2.6 are consistent with SFR SED and SFR UV + IR provided extra attenuation toward H II regions is taken into account ( A V , neb = A V , continuum /0.44). With the cross-calibrated SFR indicators in hand, we perform a consistency check on the star formation histories inferred from spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. We compare the observed SFR -M relations and mass functions at a range of redshifts to equivalents that are computed by evolving lower redshift galaxies backward in time. We find evidence for underestimated stellar ages when no stringent constraints on formation epoch are applied in SED modeling. We demonstrate how resolved SED modeling, or alternatively deep UV data, may help to overcome this bias. The age bias is most severe for galaxies with young stellar populations and reduces toward older systems. Finally, our analysis suggests that SFHs typically vary on timescales that are long (at least several 100 Myr) compared to the galaxies' dynamical time.},

Together, this unique data set sheds light on how the assembled stellar mass is distributed within galaxies, and where new stars are being formed. We find the Hα morphologies to resemble more closely those observed in the ACS I band than in the WFC3 H band, especially for the larger systems. We next derive a novel prescription for Hα dust corrections, which accounts for extra extinction toward H II regions. The prescription leads to consistent star formation rate (SFR) estimates and reproduces the observed relation between the Hα/UV luminosity ratio and visual extinction, on both a pixel-by-pixel and a galaxy-integrated level. We find the surface density of star formation to correlate with the surface density of assembled stellar mass for spatially resolved regions within galaxies, akin to the so-called "main sequence of star formation" established on a galaxy-integrated level. Deviations from this relation toward lower equivalent widths are found in the inner regions of galaxies. Clumps and spiral features, on the other hand, are associated with enhanced Hα equivalent widths, bluer colors, and higher specific SFRs compared to the underlying disk. Their Hα/UV luminosity ratio is lower than that of the underlying disk, suggesting that the ACS clump selection preferentially picks up those regions of elevated star formation activity that are the least obscured by dust. Our analysis emphasizes that monochromatic studies of galaxy structure can be severely limited by mass-to-light ratio variations due to dust and spatially inhomogeneous star formation histories.},

  abstract = {We develop a model for the cosmological role of mergers in the evolution of starbursts, quasars, and spheroidal galaxies. By combining theoretically well-constrained halo and subhalo mass functions as a function of redshift and environment with empirical halo occupation models, we can estimate where galaxies of given properties live at a particular epoch. This allows us to calculate, in an a priori cosmological manner, where major galaxy-galaxy mergers occur and what kinds of galaxies merge, at all redshifts. We compare this with the observed mass functions, clustering, fractions as a function of halo and galaxy mass, and small-scale environments of mergers, and we show that this approach yields robust estimates in good agreement with observations and can be extended to predict detailed properties of mergers. Making the simple Ansatz that major, gas-rich mergers cause quasar activity (but not strictly assuming they are the only triggering mechanism), we demonstrate that this model naturally reproduces the observed rise and fall of the quasar luminosity density at z = 0–6, as well as quasar luminosity functions, fractions, host galaxy colors, and clustering as a function of redshift and luminosity. The recent observed excess of quasar clustering on small scales at z ~ 0.2–2.5 is a natural prediction of our model, as mergers will preferentially occur in regions with excess small-scale galaxy overdensities. In fact, we demonstrate that quasar environments at all observed redshifts correspond closely to the empirically determined small group scale, where major mergers of ~ L * gas-rich galaxies will be most efficient. We contrast this with a secular model in which quasar activity is driven by bars or other disk instabilities, and we show that, while these modes of fueling probably dominate the high Eddington ratio population at Seyfert luminosities (significant at z = 0), the constraints from quasar clustering, observed pseudobulge populations, and disk mass functions suggest that they are a small contributor to the z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {gtrsim} 1 quasar luminosity density, which is dominated by massive BHs in predominantly classical spheroids formed in mergers. Similarly, low-luminosity Seyferts do not show a clustering excess on small scales, in agreement with the natural prediction of secular models, but bright quasars at all redshifts do so. We also compare recent observations of the colors of quasar host galaxies and show that these correspond to the colors of recent merger remnants, in the transition region between the blue cloud and the red sequence, and are distinct from the colors of systems with observed bars or strong disk instabilities. Even the most extreme secular models, in which all bulge (and therefore BH) formation proceeds via disk instability, are forced to assume that this instability acts before the (dynamically inevitable) mergers, and therefore predict a history for the quasar luminosity density that is shifted to earlier times, in disagreement with observations. Our model provides a powerful means to predict the abundance and nature of mergers and to contrast cosmologically motivated predictions of merger products such as starbursts and active galactic nuclei.},

  abstract      = {We present a sub-kpc localization of the sites of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth in three active galactic nuclei (AGN) at $z \sim 3$ in relation to the regions of intense star formation in their hosts. These AGNs are selected from Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations in the HUDF and COSMOS, with the centimetric radio emission tracing both star formation and AGN, and the sub/millimeter emission by dust tracing nearly pure star formation. We require radio emission to be $\geqslant5\times$ more luminous than the level associated with the sub/millimeter star formation to ensure that the radio emission is AGN-dominated, thereby allowing localization of the AGN and star formation independently. In all three galaxies, the AGN are located within the compact regions of gas-rich, heavily obscured, intense nuclear star formation, with $R\_e = 0.4-1.1$ kpc and average star formation rates of $\simeq100-1200$ $M\_\odot$yr$^{-1}$. If the current episode of star formation continues at such a rate over the stellar mass doubling time of their hosts, $\simeq 0.2$ Gyr, the newly formed stellar mass will be of the order of $10^{11}$ $M\_\odot$ within the central kpc region, concurrently and cospatially with significant growth of the SMBH. This is consistent with a picture of in-situ galactic bulge and SMBH formation. This work demonstrates the unique complementarity of VLA and ALMA observations to unambiguously pinpoint the locations of AGN and star formation down to $\simeq30$ mas, corresponding to $\simeq 230$ pc at $z = 3$.},

Current data suggest that the global star formation rate of the Universe peaked at a redshift of z = 1, then subsequently declined, leading to claims that the bulk of star formation in the Universe has been seen. However, the large uncertainties inherent in correcting for ultraviolet absorption by dust associated with young stars suggest that these formation rates might be substantially underestimated in high-redshift galaxies. Here, we circumvent this problem by considering the dust thermal emission at infrared (and submillimeter) wavelengths. We propose an improved determination of the long sought cosmic infrared background (built up from the accumulated infrared light of faint galaxies along the line of sight), from which we are able to estimate the required population of high-redshift, dust-enshrouded starburst galaxies. We argue that most of the star formation at high redshift may be hidden by dust, and we define the necessary characteristics of a feasible far-infrared survey that could detect this population.},

We study 9,100 galaxies from GOODS-S and UDS having published values of redshifts, masses, star-formation rates (SFRs), and dust attenuation ($A\_V$) derived from UV-optical SED fitting. In agreement with previous works, we find that the $UVJ$ colors of a galaxy are closely correlated with its specific star-formation rate (SSFR) and $A\_V$. We define rotated $UVJ$ coordinate axes, termed $S\_\mathrm{SED}$ and $C\_\mathrm{SED}$, that are parallel and perpendicular to the star-forming sequence and derive a quantitative calibration that predicts SSFR from $C\_\mathrm{SED}$ with an accuracy of \~{}0.2 dex. SFRs from UV-optical fitting and from UV+IR values based on Spitzer/MIPS 24 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ agree well overall, but systematic differences of order 0.2 dex exist at high and low redshifts. A novel plotting scheme conveys the evolution of multiple galaxy properties simultaneously, and dust growth, as well as star-formation decline and quenching, exhibit ``mass-accelerated evolution'' (``downsizing''). A population of transition galaxies below the star-forming main sequence is identified. These objects are located between star-forming and quiescent galaxies in $UVJ$ space and have lower $A\_V$ and smaller radii than galaxies on the main sequence. Their properties are consistent with their being in transit between the two regions. The relative numbers of quenched, transition, and star-forming galaxies are given as a function of mass and redshift.},

We find that the Pop~II star formation rate density (SFRD), produced in our simulation ($\sim 10^{-2}\ M_\odot{\rm yr^{-1}\, Mpc^{-3}}$ at $z\simeq10$), matches the total SFRD inferred from observations within a factor of $<2$ at $7\lesssim z \lesssim10$. The Pop~III SFRD reaches a plateau at $\sim10^{-3}\ M_\odot{\rm yr^{-1}\, Mpc^{-3}}$ by $z~10$, and remains largely unaffected by the presence of Pop~II feedback. At $z$=7.5, $\sim20\%$ of Pop~III star formation occurs in dark matter haloes which are isolated, and have never experienced any Pop~II star formation (i.e. primordial haloes). We predict that Pop~III-only galaxies exist at magnitudes $M_{\rm UV}\gtrsim-11$, beyond the limits for direct detection with the James Webb Space Telescope. We assess that our stellar mass function (SMF) and UV luminosity function (UVLF) agree well with the observed low mass/faint-end behaviour at $z=8$ and $10$. However, beyond the current limiting magnitudes, we find that both our SMF and UVLF demonstrate a deviation/turnover from the expected power-law slope ($M_{\rm UV,turn}= -13.4\pm1.1$ at $z$=10). Our measured turnover implies that observational studies which integrate their observed luminosity functions by extrapolating the observed faint-end slope beyond their detection limit may overestimate the true SFRD by a factor of $2 (10)$ when integrating to $M_{\rm UV} = -$12($-$8) at $z\sim10$. Our turnover correlates well with the transition from dark matter haloes dominated by molecular cooling to those dominated by atomic cooling, for a mass $M_{\rm halo}\approx10^{8}M_\odot$ at $z\simeq10$.},

  abstract      = {Massive galaxies in the young Universe, ten billion years ago, formed stars at surprising intensities. Although this is commonly attributed to violent mergers, the properties of many of these galaxies are incompatible with such events, showing gas-rich, clumpy, extended rotating disks not dominated by spheroids. Cosmological simulations and clustering theory are used to explore how these galaxies acquired their gas. Here we report that they are `stream-fed galaxies', formed from steady, narrow, cold gas streams that penetrate the shock-heated media of massive dark matter haloes. A comparison with the observed abundance of star-forming galaxies implies that most of the input gas must rapidly convert to stars. One-third of the stream mass is in gas clumps leading to mergers of mass ratio greater than 1:10, and the rest is in smoother flows. With a merger duty cycle of 0.1, three-quarters of the galaxies forming stars at a given rate are fed by smooth streams. The rarer, submillimetre galaxies that form stars even more intensely are largely merger-induced starbursts. Unlike destructive mergers, the streams are likely to keep the rotating disk configuration intact, although turbulent and broken into giant star-forming clumps that merge into a central spheroid. This stream-driven scenario for the formation of discs and spheroids is an alternative to the merger picture.},

  abstract      = {We present a simple theoretical framework for massive galaxies at high redshift, where the main assembly and star formation occurred, and report on the first cosmological simulations that reveal clumpy disks consistent with our analysis. The evolution is governed by the interplay between smooth and clumpy cold streams, disk instability, and bulge formation. Intense, relatively smooth streams maintain an unstable dense gas-rich disk. Instability with high turbulence and giant clumps, each a few percent of the disk mass, is self-regulated by gravitational interactions within the disk. The clumps migrate into a bulge in ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 10 dynamical times, or ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 0.5 Gyr. The cosmological streams replenish the draining disk and prolong the clumpy phase to several Gigayears in a steady state , with comparable masses in disk, bulge, and dark matter within the disk radius. The clumps form stars in dense subclumps following the overall accretion rate, ~100 M ☉ yr –1 , and each clump converts into stars in ~0.5 Gyr. While the clumps coalesce dissipatively to a compact bulge, the star-forming disk is extended because the incoming streams keep the outer disk dense and susceptible to instability and because of angular momentum transport. Passive spheroid-dominated galaxies form when the streams are more clumpy: the external clumps merge into a massive bulge and stir up disk turbulence that stabilize the disk and suppress in situ clump and star formation. We predict a bimodality in galaxy type by z ~ 3, involving giant-clump star-forming disks and spheroid-dominated galaxies of suppressed star formation. After z ~ 1, the disks tend to be stabilized by the dominant stellar disks and bulges. Most of the high- z massive disks are likely to end up as today's early-type galaxies.},

We address in particular the evolution of (a) the total mass inflow rate from the cosmic web into galactic haloes based on the EPS approximation, (b) the penetration of baryonic streams into the inner galaxy, (c) the disc size, (d) the implied steady-state gas content and star formation rate (SFR) in the galaxy subject to mass conservation and a universal star formation law, (e) the inflow rate within the disc to a central bulge and black hole as derived using energy conservation and self-regulated Q {\tilde} 1 violent disc instability (VDI) and (f) the implied steady state in the disc and bulge. The toy models provide useful approximations for the behaviour of the simulated galaxies. We find that (a) the inflow rate is proportional to mass and to (1 + z)$^{5/2}$, (b) the penetration to the inner halo is {\tilde}50 per cent at z=4-2, (c) the disc radius is {\tilde}5 per cent of the virial radius, (d) the galaxies reach a steady state with the SFR following the accretion rate into the galaxy, (e) there is an intense gas inflow through the disc, comparable to the SFR, following the predictions of VDI and (f) the galaxies approach a steady state with the bulge mass comparable to the disc mass, where the draining of gas by SFR, outflows and disc inflows is replenished by fresh accretion. Given the agreement with simulations, these toy models are useful for understanding the complex phenomena in simple terms and for back-of-the-envelope predictions.},

  abstract      = {We use cosmological simulations to study a characteristic evolution pattern of high-redshift galaxies. Early, stream-fed, highly perturbed, gas-rich discs undergo phases of dissipative contraction into compact, star-forming systems (`blue' nuggets) at z {\tilde} 4-2. The peak of gas compaction marks the onset of central gas depletion and inside-out quenching into compact ellipticals (red nuggets) by z {\tilde} 2. These are sometimes surrounded by gas rings or grow extended dry stellar envelopes. The compaction occurs at a roughly constant specific star formation rate (SFR), and the quenching occurs at a constant stellar surface density within the inner kpc ({$\Sigma$}$_{1}$). Massive galaxies quench earlier, faster, and at a higher {$\Sigma$}$_{1}$ than lower mass galaxies, which compactify and attempt to quench more than once. This evolution pattern is consistent with the way galaxies populate the SFR-size-mass space, and with gradients and scatter across the main sequence. The compaction is triggered by an intense inflow episode, involving (mostly minor) mergers, counter-rotating streams or recycled gas, and is commonly associated with violent disc instability. The contraction is dissipative, with the inflow rate $\gt$SFR, and the maximum {$\Sigma$}$_{1}$ anticorrelated with the initial spin parameter. The central quenching is triggered by the high SFR and stellar/supernova feedback (maybe also active galactic nucleus feedback) due to the high central gas density, while the central inflow weakens as the disc vanishes. Suppression of fresh gas supply by a hot halo allows the long-term maintenance of quenching once above a threshold halo mass, inducing the quenching downsizing.},

Galaxy Evolution Explorer UV data are used to cleanly divide the sample into star-forming and quenched galaxies and to identify galaxies in transition (the green valley). Despite a stark difference in visual appearance between blue and red galaxies, their average radial stellar mass density profiles are remarkably similar (especially in the outer regions) at fixed mass. The inner stellar mass surface density within a radius of 1 kpc, Σ 1 , is used to quantify the growth of the bulge as galaxies evolve. When galaxies are divided into narrow mass bins, their distribution in the color-Σ 1 plane at fixed mass forms plausible evolutionary tracks. Σ 1 seems to grow as galaxies evolve through the blue cloud, and once it crosses a threshold value, galaxies are seen to quench at fixed Σ 1 . The Σ 1 threshold for quenching grows with stellar mass, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/776/1/63/apj484827ieqn1.gif] {$\Sigma _1\propto M_*^{0.64}$} . However, the existence of some star-forming galaxies above the threshold Σ 1 implies that a dense bulge is necessary but not sufficient to quench a galaxy fully. This would be consistent with a two-step quenching process in which gas within a galaxy is removed or stabilized against star formation by bulge-driven processes (such as a starburst, active galactic nucleus feedback, or morphological quenching), whereas external gas accretion is suppressed by separate halo-driven processes (such as halo gas shock heating). Quenching thus depends on an interplay between the inner structure of a galaxy and its surrounding dark matter halo, and lack of perfect synchrony between the two could produce the observed scatter in color versus Σ 1 .},

  abstract = {Using a sample of ~28,000 sources selected at 3.6-4.5 μm with Spitzer observations of the Hubble Deep Field North, the Chandra Deep Field South, and the Lockman Hole (surveyed area ~664 arcmin 2 ), we study the evolution of the stellar mass content of the universe at 0 < z < 4. We calculate stellar masses and photometric redshifts, based on ~2000 templates built with stellar population and dust emission models fitting the ultraviolet to mid-infrared spectral energy distributions of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts. We estimate stellar mass functions for different redshift intervals. We find that 50% of the local stellar mass density was assembled at 0 < z < 1 (average star formation rate [SFR] 0.048 M ☉ yr −1 Mpc −3 ), and at least another 40% at 1 < z < 4 (average SFR 0.074 M ☉ yr −1 Mpc −3 ). Our results confirm and quantify the "downsizing" scenario of galaxy formation. The most massive galaxies ( M > 10 12.0 M ☉ ) assembled the bulk of their stellar content rapidly (in 1-2 Gyr) beyond z ~ 3 in very intense star formation events (producing high specific SFRs). Galaxies with 10 11.5 < M < 10 12.0 M ☉ assembled half of their stellar mass before z ~ 1.5, and more than 90% of their mass was already in place at z ~ 0.6. Galaxies with M < 10 11.5 M ☉ evolved more slowly (presenting smaller specific SFRs), assembling half of their stellar mass below z ~ 1. About 40% of the local stellar mass density of 10 9.0 < M < 10 11.0 M ☉ galaxies was assembled below z ~ 0.4, most probably through accretion of small satellites producing little star formation. The cosmic stellar mass density at z > 2.5 is dominated by optically faint ( R ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {gtrsim} 25) red galaxies (distant red galaxies or BzK sources), which account for ~30% of the global population of galaxies, but contribute at least 60% of the cosmic stellar mass density. Bluer galaxies (e.g., Lyman break galaxies) are more numerous but less massive, contributing less than 50% of the global stellar mass density at high redshift.},

  abstract    = {We simulate a self-gravitating, turbulent cloud of 1000 Msol with photoionization and radiation pressure feedback from a 34 Msol star. We use a detailed Monte Carlo radiative transfer scheme alongside the hydrodynamics to compute photoionization and thermal equilibrium with dust grains and multiple atomic species. Using these gas temperatures, dust temperatures, and ionization fractions, we produce self-consistent synthetic observations of line and continuum emission. We find that all material is dispersed from the (15.5 pc)$^3$ grid within 1.6 Myr or 0.74 free-fall times. Mass exits with a peak flux of $2 \times 10^{-3}$ Msol/yr, showing efficient gas dispersal. The model without radiation pressure has a slight delay in the breakthrough of ionization, but overall its effects are negligible. 85 per cent of the volume, and 40 per cent of the mass, become ionized -- dense filaments resist ionization and are swept up into spherical cores with pillars that point radially away from the ionizing star. We use free-free emission at 20 cm to estimate the production rate of ionizing photons. This is almost always underestimated: by a factor of a few at early stages, then by orders of magnitude as mass leaves the volume. We also test the ratio of dust continuum surface brightnesses at 450 and 850 micron to probe dust temperatures. This underestimates the actual temperature by more than a factor of 2 in areas of low column density or high line-of-sight temperature dispersion; the HII region cavity is particularly prone to this discrepancy. However, the probe is accurate in dense locations such as filaments.},

  abstract    = {The similarity between the distributions of spins for galaxies ($\lambda_{\rm g}$) and for dark-matter haloes ($\lambda_{\rm h}$), indicated both by simulations and observations, is naively interpreted as a one-to-one correlation between the spins of a galaxy and its host halo. This is used to predict galaxy sizes in semi-analytic models via $R_{\rm e}\simeq\lambda_{\rm h} R_{\rm v}$, with $R_{\rm e}$ the half-mass radius of the galaxy and $R_{\rm v}$ the halo radius. Utilizing two different suites of zoom-in cosmological simulations, we find that $\lambda_{\rm g}$ and $\lambda_{\rm h}$ are in fact only barely correlated, especially at $z\geq 1$. A general smearing of this correlation is expected based on the different spin histories, where the more recently accreted baryons through streams gain and then lose significant angular momentum compared to the gradually accumulated dark matter. Expecting the spins of baryons and dark matter to be correlated at accretion into $R_{\rm v}$, the null correlation at the end reflects an anti-correlation between $\lambda_{\rm g}/\lambda_{\rm h}$ and $\lambda_{\rm h}$, which can partly arise from mergers and a compact star-forming phase that many galaxies undergo. On the other hand, the halo and galaxy spin vectors tend to be aligned, with a median $\cos\theta=0.6$-0.7 between galaxy and halo, consistent with instreaming within a preferred plane. The galaxy spin is better correlated with the spin of the inner halo, but this largely reflects the effect of the baryons on the halo. Following the null spin correlation, $\lambda_{\rm h}$ is not a useful proxy for $R_{\rm e}$. While our simulations reproduce a general relation of the sort $R_{\rm e}=AR_{\rm vir}$, in agreement with observational estimates, the relation becomes tighter with $A=0.02(c/10)^{-0.7}$, where $c$ is the halo concentration, which in turn introduces a dependence on mass and redshift.},

  abstract = {There are very strong observed correlations between the specific star formation rates (sSFRs) of galaxies and their mean surface mass densities, Σ, as well as other aspects of their internal structure. These strong correlations have often been taken to argue that the internal structure of a galaxy must play a major physical role, directly or indirectly, in the control of star formation. In this paper we show by means of a very simple toy model that these correlations can arise naturally without any such physical role once the observed evolution of the size–mass relation for star-forming galaxies is taken into account. In particular, the model reproduces the sharp threshold in Σ between galaxies that are star-forming and those that are quenched and the evolution of this threshold with redshift. Similarly, it produces iso-quenched-fraction contours in the f Q ( m , R e ) plane that are almost exactly parallel to lines of constant Σ for centrals and shallower for satellites. It does so without any dependence on quenching on size or Σ and without invoking any differences between centrals and satellites, beyond the different mass dependences of their quenching laws. The toy model also reproduces several other observations, including the sSFR gradients within galaxies and the appearance of inside-out build-up of passive galaxies. Finally, it is shown that curvature in the main-sequence sSFR–mass relation can produce curvature in the apparent B / T ratios with mass. Our analysis therefore suggests that many of the strong correlations that are observed between galaxy structure and sSFR may well be a consequence of things unrelated to quenching and should not be taken as evidence of the physical processes that drive quenching.},

  abstract = {At z ≳ 1, the distinction between merging and “normal” star-forming galaxies based on single band morphology is often hampered by the presence of large clumps which result in a disturbed, merger-like appearance even in rotationally supported disks. In this paper we discuss how a classification based on canonical, non-parametric structural indices measured on resolved stellar mass maps, rather than on single-band images, reduces the misclassification of clumpy but not merging galaxies. We calibrate the mass-based selection of mergers using the MIRAGE hydrodynamical numerical simulations of isolated and merging galaxies which span a stellar mass range of 10 9.8 –10 10.6 M ⊙ and merger ratios between 1:1–1:6.3. These simulations are processed to reproduce the typical depth and spatial resolution of observed Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) data. We test our approach on a sample of real ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/805/2/181/apj512925ieqn1.gif] {$z\simeq 2$} galaxies with kinematic classification into disks or mergers and on ∼100 galaxies in the HUDF field with photometric/spectroscopic redshift between 1.5 ≤ z ≤ 3 and M > 10 9.4 M ⊙ . We find that a combination of the asymmetry A MASS and M 20, MASS indices measured on the stellar mass maps can efficiently identify real (major) mergers with ≲20% contamination from clumpy disks in the merger sample. This mass-based classification cannot be reproduced in star-forming galaxies by H -band measurements alone, which instead result in a contamination from clumpy galaxies which can be as high as 50%. Moreover, we find that the mass-based classification always results in a lower contamination from clumpy galaxies than an H -band classification, regardless of the depth of the imaging used (e.g., CANDELS versus HUDF).},

  abstract = {Although supernova (SN) explosions and stellar winds happen at very small scales, they affect the interstellar medium (ISM) at galactic scales and regulate the formation of a whole galaxy. Previous attempts of mimicking these effects in simulations of galaxy formation use very simplified assumptions. We develop a much more realistic prescription for modeling the feedback, which minimizes any ad hoc subgrid physics. We start with developing high-resolution models of the ISM and formulate the conditions required for its realistic functionality: formation of multiphase medium with hot chimneys, superbubbles, cold molecular phase, and very slow consumption of gas. We find that this can be achieved only by doing what the real universe does: formation of dense (>10 H atoms cm –3 ), cold ( T ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 100 K) molecular phase, where the star formation happens, and which young stars disrup. Another important ingredient is the effect of runaway stars: massive binary stars ejected from molecular clouds when one of the companions becomes an SN. Those stars can move to 10-100 pc away from molecular clouds before exploding themselves as SNe. This greatly facilitates the feedback. Once those effects are implemented into cosmological simulations, galaxy formation proceeds more realistically. For example, we do not have the overcooling problem. The angular momentum problem (resulting in a too massive bulge) is also reduced substantially: the rotation curves are nearly flat. The galaxy formation also becomes more violent. Just as often observed in quasar absorption lines, there are substantial outflows from forming and active galaxies. At high redshifts we routinely find gas with few hundred km s –1 and occasionally 1000-2000 km s –1 . The gas has high metallicity, which may exceed the solar metallicity. The temperature of the gas in the outflows and in chimneys can be very high: T =10 7 -10 8 K. The density profile of dark matter is still consistent with a cuspy profile. The simulations reproduce this picture only if the resolution is very high: better than 50 pc, which is 10 times better than the typical resolution in previous cosmological simulations. Our simulations of galaxy formation reach the resolution of 35 pc.},

  abstract      = {We examine the stellar haloes of the Auriga simulations, a suite of thirty cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical high-resolution simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies performed with the moving-mesh code AREPO. We study halo global properties and radial profiles out to $\sim 150$ kpc for each individual galaxy. The Auriga haloes are diverse in their masses and density profiles; mean metallicity and metallicity gradients; ages; and shapes, reflecting the stochasticity inherent in their accretion and merger histories. A comparison with observations of nearby late-type galaxies shows very good agreement between most observed and simulated halo properties. However, Auriga haloes are typically too massive. We find a connection between population gradients and mass assembly history: galaxies with few significant progenitors have more massive haloes, possess large negative halo metallicity gradients and steeper density profiles. The number of accreted galaxies, either disrupted or under disruption, that contribute 90\% of the accreted halo mass ranges from 2 to 15, with a median of 6.5, and their stellar masses span over three orders of magnitude. The observed halo mass--metallicity relation is well reproduced by Auriga and is set by the stellar mass and metallicity of the dominant satellite contributors. This relationship is found not only for the accreted component but also for the total (accreted + in-situ) stellar halo. Our results highlight the potential of observable halo properties to infer the assembly history of galaxies.},

  title       = {The unorthodox evolution of major merger remnants into star-forming spiral galaxies},
  abstract    = {Galaxy mergers are believed to play a key role in transforming star-forming disk galaxies into quenched ellipticals. Most of our theoretical knowledge about such morphological transformations does, however, rely on idealised simulations where processes such as cooling of hot halo gas into the disk and gas accretion in the post-merger phase are not treated in a self-consistent cosmological fashion. In this paper we study the morphological evolution of the stellar components of four major mergers occurring at z=0.5 in cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-simulations. In all simulations the merger reduces the disk mass-fraction, but all galaxies simulated at our highest resolution regrow a significant disk by z=0 (with a disk fraction larger than 24%). For runs with our default physics model, which includes galactic winds from star formation and black hole feedback, none of the merger remnants are quenched, but in a set of simulations with stronger black hole feedback we find that major mergers can indeed quench galaxies. We conclude that major merger remnants commonly evolve into star-forming disk galaxies, unless sufficiently strong AGN feedback assists in the quenching of the remnant.},

  abstract    = {In this paper, we study the effects of a recent drop in star formation rate (SFR) on the spectra of epoch of reionization (EoR) galaxies, and the resulting degeneracy with the spectral features produced by extreme Lyman continuum leakage. In order to study these effects in the wavelength range relevant for the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we utilize synthetic spectra of simulated EoR galaxies from cosmological simulations together with synthetic spectra of partially quenched mock galaxies. We find that rapid declines in the SFR of EoR galaxies could seriously affect the applicability of methods that utilize the equivalent width of Balmer lines and the ultraviolet spectral slope to assess the escape fraction of EoR galaxies. In order to determine if the degeneracy can be avoided by using the overall shape of the spectrum, we generate mock NIRCam observations and utilize a classification algorithm to identify galaxies that have undergone such quenching. We find that while there are problematic cases, JWST/NIRCam or NIRSpec should be able to reliably identify galaxies with redshifts $z\sim 7$ that have experienced a significant decrease in the SFR (by a factor 10-100) in the past 50-100 Myr with a success rate $\gtrsim 85\%$. We also find that uncertainties in the dust reddening effects on EoR galaxies significantly affect the performance of the results of the classification algorithm. We argue that studies that aim to characterize the dust extinction law most representative in the EoR would be extremely useful.},

  title       = {Downsizing of Star Formation Measured from the Clustered Infrared Background Correlated with Quasars},
  abstract    = {Powerful quasars can be seen out to large distances. As they reside in massive dark matter haloes, they provide a useful tracer of large scale structure. We stack Herschel-SPIRE images at 250, 350 and 500 microns at the location of 11,235 quasars in ten redshift bins spanning $0.5 \leq z \leq 3.5$. The unresolved dust emission of the quasar and its host galaxy dominate on instrumental beam scales, while extended emission is spatially resolved on physical scales of order a megaparsec. This emission is due to dusty star-forming galaxies clustered around the dark matter haloes hosting quasars. We measure radial surface brightness profiles of the stacked images to compute the angular correlation function of dusty star-forming galaxies correlated with quasars. We then model the profiles to determine large scale clustering properties of quasars and dusty star-forming galaxies as a function of redshift. We adopt a halo model and parameterize it by the most effective halo mass at hosting star-forming galaxies, finding $\log(M_\mathrm{eff}/M_{\odot}) = 13.8^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$ at $z=2.21-2.32$, and, at $z=0.5-0.81$, the mass is $\log(M_\mathrm{eff}/M_{\odot}) = 10.7^{+1.0}_{-0.2}$. Our results indicate a downsizing of dark matter haloes hosting dusty star-forming galaxies between $0.5 \leq z \leq 2.9$. The derived dark matter halo masses are consistent with other measurements of star-forming and sub-millimeter galaxies. The physical properties of dusty star-forming galaxies inferred from the halo model depend on details of the quasar halo occupation distribution in ways that we explore at $z>2.5$, where the quasar HOD parameters are not well constrained.},

  abstract    = {Detecting galaxies when their star-formation is being quenched is crucial to understand the mechanisms driving their evolution. We identify for the first time a sample of quenching galaxies selected just after the interruption of their star formation by exploiting the [O III]5007/Halpha ratio and searching for galaxies with undetected [O III]. Using a sample of ~174000 star-forming galaxies extracted from the SDSS-DR8 at 0.04 < z < 0.21,we identify the ~300 quenching galaxy best candidates with low [O III]/Halpha, out of ~26000 galaxies without [O III] emission. They have masses between 10^9.7 and 10^10.8 Mo, consistently with the corresponding growth of the quiescent population at these redshifts. Their main properties (i.e. star-formation rate, colours and metallicities) are comparable to those of the star-forming population, coherently with the hypothesis of recent quenching, but preferably reside in higher-density environments.Most candidates have morphologies similar to star-forming galaxies, suggesting that no morphological transformation has occurred yet. From a survival analysis we find a low fraction of candidates (~0.58% of the star-forming population), leading to a short quenching timescale of tQ~50Myr and an e-folding time for the quenching history of tauQ~90Myr, and their upper limits of tQ<0.76 Gyr and tauQ<1.5Gyr, assuming as quenching galaxies 50% of objects without [O III] (~7.5%).Our results are compatible with a 'rapid' quenching scenario of satellites galaxies due to the final phase of strangulation or ram-pressure stripping. This approach represents a robust alternative to methods used so far to select quenched galaxies (e.g. colours, specific star-formation rate, or post-starburst spectra).},

The cores exhibit strong quasi-normal oscillations that remain largely undamped on evolutionary timescales. On the other hand, no conclusive growth of the core mass by condensation or relaxation can be detected. In the incoherent halo surrounding the cores, the scalar field density profiles and velocity distributions show no significant deviation from collisionless N-body simulations on scales larger than the coherence length. Our results are consistent with the core properties being determined mainly by the coherence length at the time of virialization, whereas the Schr\"odinger-Vlasov correspondence explains the halo properties when averaged on scales greater than the coherence length.},

  abstract    = {Gas-rich minor mergers contribute significantly to the gas reservoir of early-type galaxies (ETGs) at low redshift, yet the star formation efficiency (SFE; the star formation rate divided by the molecular gas mass) appears to be strongly suppressed following some of these events, in contrast to the more well-known merger-driven starbursts. We present observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) of six ETGs, which have each recently undergone a gas-rich minor merger, as evidenced by their disturbed stellar morphologies. These galaxies were selected because they exhibit extremely low SFEs. We use the resolving power of ALMA to study the morphology and kinematics of the molecular gas. The majority of our galaxies exhibit spatial and kinematical irregularities, such as detached gas clouds, warps, and other asymmetries. These asymmetries support the interpretation that the suppression of the SFE is caused by dynamical effects stabilizing the gas against gravitational collapse. Through kinematic modelling we derive high velocity dispersions and Toomre Q stability parameters for the gas, but caution that such measurements in edge-on galaxies suffer from degeneracies. We estimate merger ages to be about 100~Myr based on the observed disturbances in the gas distribution. Furthermore, we determine that these galaxies lie, on average, two orders of magnitude below the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation for star-forming galaxies as well as below the relation for relaxed ETGs. We discuss potential dynamical processes responsible for this strong suppression of star formation surface density at fixed molecular gas surface density.},

  abstract     = {Galaxies are surrounded by sizeable gas reservoirs which host a significant amount of metals: the circum-galactic medium (CGM). The CGM acts as a mediator between the galaxy and the extra-galactic medium. However, our understanding of how galaxy mergers, a major evolutionary transformation, impact the CGM remains deficient. We present a theoretical study of the effect of galaxy mergers on the CGM. We use hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations of a major merger selected from the Illustris project such that the z=0 descendant has a halo mass and stellar mass comparable to the Milky Way. To study the CGM we then re-simulated this system at a 40 times better mass resolution, and included detailed post-processing ionization modelling. Our work demonstrates the effect the merger has on the characteristic size of the CGM, its metallicity, and the predicted covering fraction of various commonly observed gas-phase species, such as H I, C IV, and O VI. We show that merger-induced outflows can increase the CGM metallicity by 0.2-0.3 dex within 0.5 Gyr post-merger. These effects last up to 6 Gyr post-merger. While the merger increases the total metal covering fractions by factors of 2-3, the covering fractions of commonly observed UV ions decrease due to the hard ionizing radiation from the active galactic nucleus, which we model explicitly. Our study of the single simulated major merger presented in this work demonstrates the significant impact that a galaxy interaction can have on the size, metallicity, and observed column densities of the CGM.},

  abstract    = {NGC7252, which is one of the nearest major-merger galaxy remnants, is an ideal laboratory to study the processes inherent to the transformation of disc galaxies to ellipticals as observed about ~1Gyr after the collision. We obtained wide-field IFU spectroscopy with the VLT-VIMOS integral-field spectrograph covering the central 50"x50" of NGC7252 to map the stellar and ionised gas kinematics, and the distribution and conditions of the ionised gas, revealing the extent of ongoing star formation and recent star formation history. We find that the inner gas disc is not counter-rotating with respect to the stars and that the stellar kinematics appear complex with a clear indication of a prolate-like rotation component suggesting a polar merger configuration. The ongoing star formation rate is 2.2+-0.6 M_sun/yr and implies a typical depletion time of 2Gyr given the molecular gas content. Furthermore, the spatially-resolved star formation history suggests a slight radial dependence, moving outwards at later times. We confirm a large AGN-ionised gas cloud previously discovered 5kpc south of the nucleus, and find higher ionisation also at the galaxy centre relative to the surrounding gas disc. Although the higher ionisation towards the centre is potentially degenerate within the central star forming ring, it may be associated with a low-luminosity AGN. Although NGC7252 has been classified as post-starburst galaxy at the centre, the elliptical-like major-merger remnant still appears very active. A central kpc-scale gas disc has presumably re-formed quickly within the last 100Myr after final coalescence. The disc features ongoing star formation, implying Gyr long timescale to reach the red sequence through gas consumption alone. While NGC7252 is useful to probe the transformation from discs to ellipticals, it is not well-suited to study the transformation from blue to red at this point.},

Brightest galaxies in dynamically young groups have suffered their last major galaxy merger typically $\sim 2$ Gyr more recently than their counterparts in dynamically old groups. Furthermore, we study the evolution of velocity dispersion in these two classes and compare them with the analytic models of isolated halos. The velocity dispersion of dwarf galaxies in high mass, dynamically young groups increases slowly in time, while the analogous dispersion in dynamically old high-mass groups is constant. In contrast, the velocity dispersion of giant galaxies in low mass groups decreases rapidly at late times. This increasing velocity bias is caused by dynamical friction, and starts much earlier in the dynamically old groups. The recent Radio-SAGE model of galaxy formation suggests that radio luminosities of central galaxies, considered to be tracers of AGN activity, are linked to the formation history of their halos.},

The stellar populations of these dwarf galaxies at $z=0$ are formed essentially entirely "in situ": over 90$\%$ of the stellar mass is formed in the main progenitor in all but two cases, and all 15 of the galaxies have >70$\%$ of their stellar mass formed in situ. Virtually all galaxy mergers occur prior to $z\sim3$, meaning that accreted stellar populations are ancient. On average, our simulated dwarfs undergo 5 galaxy mergers in their lifetimes, with typical pre-merger galaxy mass ratios that are less than 1:10. This merger frequency is generally comparable to what has been found in dissipationless simulations when coupled with abundance matching. Two of the simulated dwarfs have a luminous satellite companion at $z=0$. These ultra-faint dwarfs lie at or below current detectability thresholds but are intriguing targets for next-generation facilities. The small contribution of accreted stars make it extremely difficult to discern the effects of mergers in the vast majority of dwarfs either photometrically or using resolved-star color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). The important implication for near-field cosmology is that star formation histories of comparably massive galaxies derived from resolved CMDs should trace the build-up of stellar mass in one main system across cosmic time as opposed to reflecting the contributions of many individual star formation histories of merged dwarfs.},

  abstract  = {Major galaxy-galaxy merging can play an important role in the history of massive galaxies (stellar masses $\gt$ 2E10 Msun) over cosmic time. An important way to measure the impact of major merging is to study close pairs of galaxies stellar mass or flux ratios between 1 and 4. We improve on the best recent efforts by probing merging of lower mass galaxies, anchoring evolutionary trends from five Hubble Space Telescope Legacy fields in the Cosmic Assembly Near-Infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) to the nearby universe using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to measure the fraction of massive galaxies in such pairs during six epochs spanning 0$\lt$z$\lt$3. We perform comprehensive tests of the impact of pair selection techniques, demonstrating that individual selection items such as redshift proximity, mass or flux ratios, projected separations and corrections for random pairing play an important role, thus, the computed fractions are strongly dependent on the employed pair selection. For a range of projected separations (5-30 to 5-50 kpc), the mass-ratio fraction increases from 4-7\% (z\~{}0) to 9-16\% (z = 1.0-1.5), then turns over and decreases to 5-10\% at z=3. Yet, for flux ratio defined pairs we find higher fractions that continue to increase with redshift with no turnover. We estimate merger rates from the mass-ratio fractions using simple time scale assumptions. Despite good agreement with previous studies up to z\~{}1-1.5, our merger rates are in tension with those predicted by simulations at z$\gt$1.5. This implies that major merging may not be as important at high redshifts as previously thought, merger timescales may not be fully understood, or we may be missing evidence of mergers at z\~{}2-3 owing to CANDELS selections effects. Next, we will analyze pair fractions and merging timescales within realistic mocks of CANDELS from state of the art Semi-Analytic Model (SAM) to better understand and calibrate our empirical results.},

  abstract      = {The rate of major galaxy-galaxy merging is theoretically predicted to steadily increase with redshift during the peak epoch of massive galaxy development ($1{\leq}z{\leq}3$). We use close-pair statistics to objectively study the incidence of massive galaxies (stellar $M\_{1}{\geq}2{\times}10^{10}M\_{\odot}$) hosting major companions ($1{\leq}M\_{1}/M\_{2}{\leq}4$; i.e., $\lt$4:1) at six epochs spanning $0{\lt}z{\lt}3$. We select companions from a nearly complete, mass-limited ($\geq5{\times}10^{9}M\_{\odot}$) sample of 23,696 galaxies in the five CANDELS fields and the SDSS. Using $5-50$ kpc projected separation and close redshift proximity criteria, we find that the major companion fraction $f\_{\mathrm{mc}}(z)$ based on stellar mass-ratio (MR) selection increases from 6\% ($z{\sim}0$) to 16\% ($z{\sim}0.8$), then turns over at $z{\sim}1$ and decreases to 7\% ($z{\sim}3$). Instead, if we use a major F160W flux ratio (FR) selection, we find that $f\_{\mathrm{mc}}(z)$ increases steadily until $z=3$ owing to increasing contamination from minor (MR$\gt$4:1) companions at $z\gt1$. We show that these evolutionary trends are statistically robust to changes in companion proximity. We find disagreements between published results are resolved when selection criteria are closely matched. If we compute merger rates using constant fraction-to-rate conversion factors ($C\_{\mathrm{merg,pair}}{=}0.6$ and $T\_{\mathrm{obs,pair}}{=}0.65\mathrm{Gyr}$), we find that MR rates disagree with theoretical predictions at $z{\gt}1.5$. Instead, if we use an evolving $T\_{\mathrm{obs,pair}}(z){\propto}(1+z)^{-2}$ from Snyder et al., our MR-based rates agree with theory at $0{\lt}z{\lt}3$. Our analysis underscores the need for detailed calibration of $C\_{\mathrm{merg,pair}}$ and $T\_{\mathrm{obs,pair}}$ as a function of redshift, mass and companion selection criteria to better constrain the empirical major merger history.},

  abstract    = {The Virgo Environmental Survey Tracing Ionised Gas Emission (VESTIGE) is a blind narrow-band H$\alpha$+[NII] imaging survey carried out with MegaCam at the CFHT. During pilot observations we have observed NGC 4330, an intermediate mass, edge-on star forming spiral currently falling into the core of the Virgo cluster. New deep observations revealed a low surface brightness 10 kpc tail exhibiting a peculiar filamentary structure. The filaments are remarkably parallel one another and clearly indicate the direction of motion of the galaxy in the Virgo potential. Motivated by the detection of these features, indicating ongoing gas stripping, we collected literature photometry in 15 bands from the far-UV to the far-IR and deep optical long slit spectroscopy using the FORS2 instrument at the ESO Very Large Telescope. Using a newly developed Monte Carlo code that jointly fits spectroscopy and photometry, we reconstructed the star formation histories in apertures along the major axis of the galaxy. Our results have been validated against the output of CIGALE, a fitting code which has been previously used for similar studies. We found a clear outside-in gradient with radius of the time when the quenching event started: the outermost radii have been stripped 500 Myr ago, while the stripping has reached the inner 5 kpc from the center in the last 100 Myr. Regions at even smaller radii are currently still forming stars fueled by the presence of HI and H2 gas. When compared to statistical studies of the quenching timescales in the local Universe we find that ram pressure stripping of the cold gas is an effective mechanism to reduce the transformation times for galaxies falling into massive clusters. Future systematic studies of all the active galaxies observed by VESTIGE in the Virgo cluster will extend these results to a robust statistical framework.},

  abstract  = {We investigate the environmental quenching of galaxies, especially those with stellar masses (M*) smaller than 10\^{}9.5 M{\sun}, beyond the local universe. Essentially all local low-mass quenched galaxies (QGs) are believed to live close to massive central galaxies, which is a demonstration of environmental quenching. We use CANDELS data to test whether or not such a dwarf QG--massive central galaxy connection exists beyond the local universe. For this purpose, we only need a statistically representative, rather than a complete, sample of low-mass galaxies, which enables our study out to z $\gt$ 1.5. For each low-mass galaxy, we measure the projected distance (dproj) to its nearest massive (M* $\gt$ 10\^{}10.5 M{\sun}) neighbor within a redshift range. At a given z and M*, the environmental quenching effect is considered to be observed if the dproj distribution of QGs is significantly skewed toward lower values than that of star-forming galaxies (SFGs). For galaxies with 10\^{}8 M{\sun} $\lt$ M* $\lt$ 10\^{}10 M{\sun}, such a difference between the dproj distributions of quenched and star-forming populations is detected up to z {\tilde} 1. Also, about 10\% of the quenched galaxies in our sample are located between two and four virial radii (R\_Vir) of the massive halos. The median projected distance from low-mass QGs to their massive neighbors (dproj/R\_Vir) decreases with satellite M* at M* $\lt$ 10\^{}9.5 M{\sun}, but increases with satellite M* at M* $\gt$ 10\^{}9.5 M{\sun}. This trend suggests a smooth, if any, transition of the quenching timescale around M* of 10\^{}9.5 M{\sun} at 0.5 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1.0.},

  abstract    = {While major mergers have long been proposed as a driver of both AGN activity and the M-sigma relation, studies of moderate to high redshift Seyfert-luminosity AGN hosts have found little evidence for enhanced rates of interactions. However, both theory and observation suggest that while these AGN may be fueled by stochastic accretion and secular processes, high-luminosity, high-redshift, and heavily obscured AGN are the AGN most likely to be merger-driven. To better sample this population of AGN, we turn to infrared selection in the CANDELS/COSMOS field. Compared to their lower-luminosity and less obscured X-ray-only counterparts, IR-only AGN (luminous, heavily obscured AGN) are more likely to be classified as either irregular (50$^{+12}_{-12}$% vs. 9$^{+5}_{-2}$%) or asymmetric (69$^{+9}_{-13}$% vs. 17$^{+6}_{-4}$%) and are less likely to have a spheroidal component (31$^{+13}_{-9}$% vs. 77$^{+4}_{-6}$%). Furthermore, IR-only AGN are also significantly more likely than X-ray-only AGN (75$^{+8}_{-13}$% vs. 31$^{+6}_{-6}$%) to be classified either as interacting or merging in a way that significantly disturbs the host galaxy or disturbed though not clearly interacting or merging, which potentially represents the late stages of a major merger. This suggests that while major mergers may not contribute significantly to the fueling of Seyfert luminosity AGN, interactions appear to play a more dominant role in the triggering and fueling of high-luminosity heavily obscured AGN.},

  abstract = { I present a comprehensive review of the evolution of galaxy structure in the Universe from the first galaxies currently observable at z ∼ 6 down to galaxies observable in the local Universe. Observed changes in galaxy structures reveal formation processes that only galaxy structural analyses can provide. This pedagogical review provides a detailed discussion of the major methods used to study galaxies morphologically and structurally, including the well-established visual method for morphology; Sérsic fitting to measure galaxy sizes and surface brightness profile shapes; and nonparametric structural methods [such as the concentration (C), asymmetry (A), clumpiness (S) (CAS) method and the Gini/M20 parameters, as well as newer structural indices]. These structural indices measure fundamental properties of galaxies, such as their scale, star-formation rate, and ongoing merger activity. Extensive observational results demonstrate how broad galaxy morphologies and structures change with time up to z ∼ 3, from small, compact and peculiar systems in the distant Universe to the formation of the Hubble sequence, dominated by spirals and ellipticals. Structural methods accurately identify galaxies in mergers and allow measurements of the merger history out to z ∼ 3. I depict properties and evolution of internal structures of galaxies, such as bulges, disks, bars, and at z>1 large star-forming clumps. I describe the structure and morphologies of host galaxies of active galactic nuclei and starbursts/submillimeter galaxies, along with how morphological galaxy quenching occurs. The role of environment in producing structural changes in galaxies over cosmic time is also discussed. Galaxy sizes can also change with time, with measured sizes up to a factor of 2–5 smaller at high redshift at a given stellar mass. I conclude with a discussion of how the evolving trends, in sizes, structures, and morphologies, reveal the formation mechanisms behind galaxies and provides a new and unique way to test theories of galaxy formation. },

  abstract      = {We present an analysis of galaxies in the CDF-South. We find a tight relation to z = 3 between color and size at a given mass, with red galaxies being small, and blue galaxies being large. We show that the relation is driven by stellar surface density or inferred velocity dispersion: galaxies with high surface density are red and have low specific star formation rates, and galaxies with low surface density are blue and have high specific star formation rates. Surface density and inferred velocity dispersion are better correlated with specific star formation rate and color than stellar mass. Hence stellar mass by itself is not a good predictor of the star formation history of galaxies. In general, galaxies at a given surface density have higher specific star formation rates at higher redshift. Specifically, galaxies with a surface density of (1-3) {\times} 10$^{9}$ M$_{⊙}$ kpc$^{-2}$ are ``red and dead'' at low redshift, approximately 50\% are forming stars at z = 1, and almost all are forming stars by z = 2. This provides direct additional evidence for the late evolution of galaxies onto the red sequence. The sizes of galaxies at a given mass evolve like 1/(1 + z)$^{0.59 +/- 0.10}$. Hence galaxies undergo significant upsizing in their history. The size evolution is fastest for the highest mass galaxies and quiescent galaxies. The persistence of the structural relations from z = 0 to z = 2.5, and the upsizing of galaxies imply that a relation analogous to the Hubble sequence exists out to z = 2.5, and possibly beyond. The star-forming galaxies at z $\gt$= 1.5 are quite different from star-forming galaxies at z = 0, as they have likely very high gas fractions, and star formation timescales comparable to the orbital time.},

The data are sufficiently deep to identify companions to these hosts whose stellar masses are ten times smaller. By searching for these around 404 quiescent hosts within a physical annulus 10 h $^{-1}$ kpc $\lt$ R $\lt$ 30 h $^{-1}$ kpc, we estimate the minor merger rate over 0.4 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2. We find that 13\%-18\% of quiescent hosts have likely physical companions with stellar mass ratios of 0.1 or greater. Mergers of these companions will typically increase the host mass by 6\% {\plusmn} 2\% per merger timescale. We estimate the minimum growth rate necessary to explain the declining abundance of compact galaxies. Using a simple model motivated by recent numerical simulations, we then assess whether mergers of the faint companions with their hosts are sufficient to explain this minimal rate. We find that mergers may explain most of the size evolution observed at z $\lt$\~{} 1 if a relatively short merger timescale is assumed, but the rapid growth seen at higher redshift likely requires additional physical processes.},

  abstract = {We study the population of galactic discs expected in current hierarchical clustering models for structure formation. A rotationally supported disc with exponential surface density profile is assumed to form with a mass and angular momentum which are fixed fractions of those of its surrounding dark halo. We assume that haloes respond adiabatically to disc formation, and that only stable discs can correspond to real systems. With these assumptions the predicted population can match both present-day discs and the damped Lyalpha absorbers in QSO spectra. Good agreement is found provided that: (i) the masses of discs are a few per cent of those of their haloes; (ii) the specific angular momenta of discs are similar to those of their haloes; (iii) present-day discs were assembled recently (at z$\lt$=1). In particular, the observed scatter in the size-rotation velocity plane is reproduced, as are the slope and scatter of the Tully-Fisher (TF) relation. The zero-point of the TF relation is matched for a stellar mass-to-light ratio of 1 to 2 h in the I-band, consistent with observational values derived from disc dynamics. High-redshift discs are predicted to be small and dense, and could plausibly merge together to form the observed population of elliptical galaxies. In many (but not all) currently popular cosmogonies, discs with rotation velocities exceeding 200 kms\^{}-1 can account for a third or more of the observed damped Lyalpha systems at z\~{}2.5. Half of the lines of sight to such systems are predicted to intersect the absorber at r$\gt$\~{}3h\^{}-1kpc and about 10 per cent at r$\gt$10h\^{}-1kpc. The cross-section for absorption is strongly weighted towards discs with large angular momentum and therefore large size for their mass. The galaxy population associated with damped absorbers should thus be biased towards low surface brightness systems.},

  abstract      = {Using a high-resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulation of the formation of a massive spheroidal galaxy we show that elliptical galaxies can be very compact and massive at high redshift in agreement with recent observations. Accretion of stripped infalling stellar material increases the size of the system with time and the central concentration is reduced by dynamical friction of the surviving stellar cores. In a specific case of a spheroidal galaxy with a final stellar mass of 1.5 {\times} 10$^{11}$ M $_{sun}$ we find that the effective radius r$_{e}$ increases from 0.7 {\plusmn} 0.2 kpc at z = 3 to r$_{e}$ = 2.4 {\plusmn} 0.4 kpc at z = 0 with a concomitant decrease in the effective density of an order of magnitude and a decrease of the central velocity dispersion by approximately 20\% over this time interval. A simple argument based on the virial theorem shows that during the accretion of weakly bound material (minor mergers) the radius can increase as the square of the mass in contrast to the usual linear rate of increase for major mergers. By undergoing minor mergers compact high-redshift spheroids can evolve into present-day systems with sizes and concentrations similar to observed local ellipticals. This indicates that minor mergers may be the main driver for the late evolution of sizes and densities of early-type galaxies.},

  abstract      = {Observations have shown that massive galaxies at high redshift have much smaller effective radii than galaxies of similar mass today; however, recent work has shown that they have similar central densities. The primary growth of size, therefore, relates to the apparent relative abundance of low-density material at low redshifts. But various models have been proposed to accomplish this, and the exact contribution of these mechanisms, relative to others that would, for example, lower the density of the system uniformly, or relate to possible observational misestimates of the stellar mass distribution, remain uncertain, as does the degree to which this evolution is driven by processes of initial spheroid formation versus subsequent `dry' assembly of spheroids. These different possibilities also yield dramatically different constraints on any possible evolution in the M$_{BH}$-{$\sigma$} relation. Here, we compile observations of spheroid properties as a function of redshift and use them to test the different proposed models, each of which we have calibrated and studied in a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations. We show that the evolution in progenitor disc gas fractions with redshift gives rise to the initial formation of smaller spheroids at high redshift. We then consider how these early-forming systems must evolve to be consistent with the larger sizes of old spheroids today. We consider (1) equal-density `dry' mergers, (2) later major or minor `dry' mergers with less dense galaxies, (3) adiabatic expansion, after significant gas mass loss, (4) gradients in stellar mass-to-light ratios from young nuclear stellar populations (yielding smaller R$_{e}$ at early times, which vanish as the system fades), (5) biases in the stellar mass estimation of high-redshift (young) systems (from e.g. uncertain asymptotic giant branch starlight contributions) and (6) observational effects (possible biases in fitting or missed light from surface brightness dimming, or the effects of different definitions of effective radii). In principle, any of these models could be tuned to explain any observed effective radius evolution. However, the predicted evolution in velocity dispersions, central stellar mass surface densities and profile shape are very distinct. Comparing with observations, only model (2), later or minor `dry' mergers with less dense systems, is consistent with the constraints as an explanation of the entire effect. Moreover, it is the only model which allows for any evolution in M$_{BH}$-{$\sigma$} towards more massive black holes (BHs) at high redshift. Still, the amount of merging needed for this to explain the observed factor of \~{}6 size evolution is larger than that predicted by hierarchical growth and clustering constraints. We, therefore, consider a cosmologically motivated model with high-resolution simulations, in which the initial galaxy forms in a gas rich merger and is observed at an appropriate age under representative conditions, then evolves undergoing a `typical' level of dry merging and mass loss. We show that this case is consistent with all the observational constraints without tension with cosmological expectations. Effect (2), which builds up an extended, low-density envelope, dominates the evolution (giving factors \~{}2-3 size evolution), but effects (1), (3), (4) and (possibly) (6) each contribute an additional \~{}20 per cent size evolution (net factor of \~{}2), together bringing the natural cosmological predictions into good agreement with the combination of observational constraints. We discuss implications for the evolution in correlations between BH and host bulge properties and show that this naturally predicts some evolution similar to that observed; better observations of BH masses could also constrain host galaxy merger histories.},

  abstract      = {At a fixed stellar mass, the size of low-redshift early-type galaxies is found to be a factor of 2 larger than that of their counterparts at z{\tilde} 1, a result with important implications for galaxy formation models. In this paper, we have explored the buildup of the local mass-size relation of elliptical galaxies using two visually classified samples. At low redshift, we compiled a subsample of 2656 elliptical galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, whereas at higher redshift (up to z{\tilde} 1), we extracted a sample of 228 objects from the Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys images of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey. All the galaxies in our study have spectroscopic data, allowing us to determine the age and mass of the stellar component. Contrary to previous claims in the literature, using the fossil record information contained in the stellar populations of our local sample, we do not find any evidence for an age segregation at a given stellar mass, depending on the size of the galaxies. At a fixed dynamical mass, there is only a {\lsim}9 per cent size difference in the two extreme age quartiles of our sample. Consequently, the local evidence does not support a scenario whereby the present-day mass-size relation has been progressively established via a bottom-up sequence, where older galaxies occupy the lower part of this relation, remaining in place since their formation. We do not find any age-segregation difference in our high-z sample either. Therefore, we find a trend in size that is insensitive to the age of the stellar populations, at least since z{\tilde} 1. This result supports the idea that the stellar mass-size relation is formed at z{\tilde} 1, with all galaxies populating a region which roughly corresponds to 1/2 of the present size distribution. We have explored two possible scenarios for size growth: puffing up or minor merging. The fact that the evolution in size is independent of the stellar age, together with the absence of an increase in the scatter of the relationship with redshift does not support the puffing-up mechanism. The observational evidence, however, cannot reject at this stage the minor-merging hypothesis. We have made an estimation of the number of minor-merger events necessary to bring the high-z galaxies into the local relation compatible with the observed size evolution. Since z= 0.8, if the mass ratio of the merger is 1:3, then we estimate {\tilde}3 {\plusmn} 1 minor mergers and if the ratio is 1:10, then we obtain {\tilde}8 {\plusmn} 2 events.},

  abstract      = {There is observational evidence for inside-out growth of giant elliptical galaxies since z {\gsim} 2-3, which is - in contrast to disc galaxies - not driven by in situ star formation. Many of the {\tilde}10$^{11}$ M$_{⊙}$ systems at high redshift have small sizes {\tilde}1 kpc and surface brightness profiles with low-S{\'e}rsic indices n. The most likely descendants at z = 0 have, on average, grown by a factor of 2 in mass and a factor of 4 in size, indicating r {\prop} M$^{α}$ with {$\alpha$} {\gsim} 2. They also have surface brightness profiles with n {\gsim} 5. This evolution can be qualitatively explained on the basis of two assumptions: compact ellipticals predominantly grow by collisionless minor (mass-ratio 1:10) or intermediate (mass-ratio 1:5) `dry' mergers, and they are embedded in massive dark matter haloes which support the stripping of merging satellite stars at large radii. We draw these conclusions from idealized collisionless mergers spheroidal galaxies - with and without dark matter - with mass ratios of 1:1, 1:5 and 1:10. The sizes evolve as r {\prop} M$^{α}$ with {$\alpha$} $\lt$ 2 for mass-ratios of 1:1 (and 1:5 without dark matter haloes) and, while doubling the stellar mass, the S{\'e}rsic index increases from n {\tilde} 4 to n {\tilde} 5. For minor mergers of galaxies embedded in dark matter haloes, the sizes grow significantly faster and the profile shapes change more rapidly. Surprisingly, already mergers with moderate mass-ratios of 1:5, well motivated by recent cosmological simulations, give {$\alpha$} {\tilde} 2.3 and after only two merger generations ({\tilde}40 per cent added stellar mass) the S{\'e}rsic index has increased to n $\gt$ 8 (n {\tilde} 5.5 without dark matter), reaching a final value of n = 9.5 after doubling the stellar mass. This is accompanied by a significant increase of the dark matter fraction (from {\tilde}40 to {\gsim}70 per cent) within the stellar half-mass radius, driven by the strong size increase probing larger, dark matter-dominated regions. For equal-mass mergers the effect is much weaker. We conclude that only a few intermediate mass-ratio mergers ({\tilde} 3-5 with initial mass-ratios of 1:5) of galaxies embedded in massive dark matter haloes can result in the observed concurrent inside-out growth and the rapid evolution in profile shapes. This process might explain the existence of present-day giant ellipticals with sizes, r $\gt$ 4 kpc, high S{\'e}rsic indices, n $\gt$ 5, and a significant amount of dark matter within the half-light radius. Apart from negative stellar metallicity gradients such a `minor' merger scenario also predicts significantly lower dark matter fractions for z {\tilde} 2 compact quiescent galaxies and their rare present-day analogues.},

  abstract      = {We present the evolution of the stellar mass function (SMF) of galaxies from z = 4.0 to z = 1.3 measured from a sample constructed from the deep near-infrared Multi-wavelength Survey by Yale-Chile, the Faint Infrared Extragalactic Survey, and the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-Chandra Deep Field South surveys, all having very high-quality optical to mid-infrared data. This sample, unique in that it combines data from surveys with a large range of depths and areas in a self-consistent way, allowed us to (1) minimize the uncertainty due to cosmic variance and empirically quantify its contribution to the total error budget; (2) simultaneously probe the high-mass end and the low-mass end (down to \~{}0.05 times the characteristic stellar mass) of the SMF with good statistics; and (3) empirically derive the redshift-dependent completeness limits in stellar mass. We provide, for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of random and systematic uncertainties affecting the derived SMFs, including the effect of metallicity, extinction law, stellar population synthesis model, and initial mass function. We find that the mass density evolves by a factor of \~{}17$^{+7}$ $_{-10}$ since z = 4.0, mostly driven by a change in the normalization {$\Phi$}$^{sstarf}$. If only random errors are taken into account, we find evidence for mass-dependent evolution, with the low-mass end evolving more rapidly than the high-mass end. However, we show that this result is no longer robust when systematic uncertainties due to the SED-modeling assumptions are taken into account. Another significant uncertainty is the contribution to the overall stellar mass density of galaxies below our mass limit; future studies with WFC3 will provide better constraints on the SMF at masses below 10$^{10}$ M $_{sun}$ at z$\gt$2. Taking our results at face value, we find that they are in conflict with semianalytic models of galaxy formation. The models predict SMFs that are in general too steep, with too many low-mass galaxies and too few high-mass galaxies. The discrepancy at the high-mass end is susceptible to uncertainties in the models and the data, but the discrepancy at the low-mass end may be more difficult to explain.

  abstract      = {A central challenge in observational studies of galaxy formation is how to associate progenitor galaxies with their descendants at lower redshifts. One promising approach is to link galaxies at fixed number density rather than fixed luminosity or mass. This method is effective if stellar mass rank order is broadly conserved through cosmic time. In this paper, we use the Guo et al. semi-analytical model to analyze under what circumstances this assumption is valid in the context of a cosmological simulation. Specifically, we select progenitor galaxies at a constant number density and compare the stellar mass evolution of their descendants to the evolution at a constant number density. The median stellar mass of the descendants increases by a factor of four (0.6 dex) from z = 3 to z = 0. Constant number density selection reproduces this to within 40\% (0.15 dex) over a wide range of number densities. We show that the discrepancy primarily results from scatter in the stellar mass growth rates and merging. After applying simple, observationally based corrections for these processes, the discrepancy is reduced to 12\% (0.05 dex). We conclude that number density selection can be used to predict the median descendant mass of high-redshift progenitor galaxies. The main uncertainty in this study is that semi-analytical models do not reproduce the observed mass evolution of galaxies, which makes the quantitative aggregate effects of star formation, merging, and quenching on the rank order of galaxies somewhat uncertain.},

  abstract      = {Comparing galaxies across redshifts at fixed cumulative number density is a popular way to estimate the evolution of specific galaxy populations. This method ignores scatter in mass accretion histories and galaxy-galaxy mergers, which can lead to errors when comparing galaxies over large redshift ranges ({$\Delta$}z $\gt$ 1). We use abundance matching in the {$\Lambda$}CDM paradigm to estimate the median change in cumulative number density with redshift and provide a simple fit (+0.16 dex per unit {$\Delta$}z) for progenitors of z = 0 galaxies. We find that galaxy descendants do not evolve in the same way as galaxy progenitors, largely due to scatter in mass accretion histories. We also provide estimates for the 1{$\sigma$} range of cumulative number densities corresponding to galaxy progenitors and descendants. Finally, we discuss some limits on cumulative number density comparisons, which arise due to difficulties measuring physical quantities (e.g., stellar mass) consistently across redshifts. A public tool to calculate cumulative number density evolution for galaxies, as well as approximate halo masses, is available online.},

We present X-Shooter spectra from the UV to NIR and dynamical mass measurements of five quiescent massive ($\gt$10$^{11}$ M $_{⊙}$) galaxies at z \~{} 2. This triples the sample of z $\gt$ 1.5 galaxies with well-constrained ({$\delta$}{$\sigma$} $\lt$ 100 km s$^{-1}$) velocity dispersion measurements. From spectral population synthesis modeling we find that these galaxies have stellar ages that range from 0.5 to 2 Gyr, with no signs of ongoing star formation. We measure velocity dispersions (290-450 km s$^{-1}$) from stellar absorption lines and find that they are 1.6-2.1 times higher than those of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at the same mass. Sizes are measured using GALFIT from Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 H $_{160}$ and UDS K-band images. The dynamical masses correspond well to the spectral energy distribution based stellar masses, with dynamical masses that are \~{}15\% higher. We find that M $_{*}$/M $_{dyn}$ may decrease slightly with time, which could reflect the increase of the dark matter fraction within an increasing effective radius. We combine different stellar kinematic studies from the literature and examine the structural evolution from z \~{} 2 to z \~{} 0: we confirm that at fixed dynamical mass, the effective radius increases by a factor of \~{}2.8, and the velocity dispersion decreases by a factor of \~{}1.7. The mass density within one effective radius decreases by a factor of \~{}20, while within a fixed physical radius (1 kpc) it decreases only mildly (factor of \~{}2). When we allow for an evolving mass limit by selecting a population of galaxies at fixed number density, a stronger size growth with time is found (factor of \~{}4), velocity dispersion decreases by a factor of \~{}1.4, and interestingly, the mass density within 1 kpc is consistent with no evolution. This finding suggests that massive quiescent galaxies at z \~{} 2 grow inside out, consistent with the expectations from minor mergers.},

Combining our H{$\alpha$} measurements of 854 galaxies at 0.8 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1.5 with those of ground-based surveys at lower and higher redshift, we can consistently determine the evolution of the EW(H{$\alpha$}) distribution from z = 0 to z = 2.2. We find that at all masses the characteristic EW(H{$\alpha$}) is decreasing toward the present epoch, and that at each redshift the EW(H{$\alpha$}) is lower for high-mass galaxies. We find EW(H{$\alpha$}) \~{}(1 + z)$^{1.8}$ with little mass dependence. Qualitatively, this measurement is a model-independent confirmation of the evolution of star-forming galaxies with redshift. A quantitative conversion of EW(H{$\alpha$}) to specific star formation rate (sSFR) is model dependent because of differential reddening corrections between the continuum and the Balmer lines. The observed EW(H{$\alpha$}) can be reproduced with the characteristic evolutionary history for galaxies, whose star formation rises with cosmic time to z \~{} 2.5 and then decreases to z = 0. This implies that EW(H{$\alpha$}) rises to 400 {\AA} at z = 8. The sSFR evolves faster than EW(H{$\alpha$}), as the mass-to-light ratio also evolves with redshift. We find that the sSFR evolves as (1 + z)$^{3.2}$, nearly independent of mass, consistent with previous reddening insensitive estimates. We confirm previous results that the observed slope of the sSFR-z relation is steeper than the one predicted by models, but models and observations agree in finding little mass dependence.

We use four redshift windows chosen to exploit new near-infrared multi-object spectrographs. We predict how the BPT diagram will appear in these four redshift windows given different sets of assumptions. We show that the position of star-forming galaxies on the BPT diagram traces the interstellar medium conditions and radiation field in galaxies at a given redshift. Galaxies containing active galactic nucleus (AGN) form a mixing sequence with purely star-forming galaxies. This mixing sequence may change dramatically with cosmic time, due to the metallicity sensitivity of the optical emission-lines. Furthermore, the position of the mixing sequence may probe metallicity gradients in galaxies as a function of redshift, depending on the size of the AGN narrow-line region. We apply our latest slow shock models for gas shocked by galactic-scale winds. We show that at high redshift, galactic wind shocks are clearly separated from AGN in line ratio space. Instead, shocks from galactic winds mimic high metallicity starburst galaxies. We discuss our models in the context of future large near-infrared spectroscopic surveys.},

  abstract = {In the first paper in this series, we presented a low-density grid of models of high-velocity photoionizing radiative shocks, including magnetic pressure support in the photoionization/recombination zone. Here we apply these models to the line ratios observed in narrow-line emission regions in active galaxies. From a set of line diagnostic diagrams, we find that LINER galaxies, narrow-line radio galaxies, and cooling flow emission regions can be modeled in terms of fast shocks in a relatively gas poor environment. Emission from a photoionized precursor of the shock is either weak or absent. On the other hand, the narrow-line regions associated with Seyfert 2 and 1.5 galaxies and the energetic luminous IR galaxies can be understood as fast shocks in a gas-rich environment, in which the EUV photons produced in the shock are fully, or mostly, absorbed in the shock precursor H ii region. For LINER-like objects, shock velocities required range from 150 to 500 km s$^{-1}$, but the Seyfert spectra require shocks typically in the range 300-500 km s$^{-1}$ These figures are comparable to the observed line widths in both these classes of object. The magnetic parameter that characterizes these shocks is about 2 $\lt$ B/n$^{1/2}$ $\lt$ 4 {$\mu$}G cm$^{3/2}$, typical of the general interstellar medium. Our fast shock models are capable of explaining the long-standing ``temperature problem'' of active galactic nuclei, in which the electron temperatures observed are found to be systematically higher than predicted by photoionization models. For Seyfert galaxies, the preshock densities are clearly higher than the 1 cm$^{-3}$ used in the model grid. Finally, we find evidence that nitrogen is enhanced above solar values in both Seyfert and in LINER nuclei.},

Comparing H{$\alpha$} sizes to continuum sizes, we find $\lt$r$_{e}$ (H{$\alpha$})/r$_{e}$ (R) $\gt$ =1.3 {\plusmn} 0.1 for the full sample. That is, star formation, as traced by H{$\alpha$}, typically occurs out to larger radii than the rest-frame R-band stellar continuum; galaxies are growing their radii and building up from the inside out. This effect appears to be somewhat more pronounced for the largest galaxies. Using the measured H{$\alpha$} sizes, we derive star formation rate surface densities, {$\Sigma$}$_{SFR}$. We find that {$\Sigma$}$_{SFR}$ ranges from \~{}0.05 M $_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$ for the largest galaxies to \~{}5 M $_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$ for the smallest galaxies, implying a large range in physical conditions in rapidly star-forming z \~{} 1 galaxies. Finally, we infer that all galaxies in the sample have very high gas mass fractions and stellar mass doubling times $\lt$500 Myr. Although other explanations are also possible, a straightforward interpretation is that we are simultaneously witnessing the rapid formation of compact bulges and large disks at z \~{} 1.},

  abstract      = {We present Hα maps at 1 kpc spatial resolution for star-forming galaxies at z ˜ 1, made possible by the Wide Field Camera 3 grism on Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Employing this capability over all five 3D-HST/CANDELS fields provides a sample of 3200 galaxies enabling a division into subsamples based on stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR). By creating deep stacked Hα images, we reach surface brightness limits of 1 × 10-18 erg s-1 cm-2 arcsec-2, allowing us to map the distribution of ionized gas to ˜10 kpc for typical L* galaxies at this epoch. We find that the spatial extent of the Hα distribution increases with stellar mass as {r}{{H}α }=1.5{({M}* /{10}10{M}⊙ )}0.23 kpc. The Hα emission is more extended than the stellar continuum emission, consistent with inside-out assembly of galactic disks. This effect grows stronger with mass as {r}{{H}α }/{r}* =1.1 {({M}* /{10}10{M}⊙ )}0.054. We map the Hα distribution as a function of SFR(IR+UV) and find evidence for “coherent star formation” across the SFR-M * plane: above the main sequence (MS), Hα is enhanced at all radii; below the MS, Hα is depressed at all radii. This suggests that at all masses the physical processes driving the enhancement or suppression of star formation act throughout the disks of galaxies. At high masses ({10}10.5\lt {M}* /{M}⊙ \lt {10}11), above the MS, Hα is particularly enhanced in the center, potentially building bulges and/or supermassive black holes. Below the MS, a strong central dip in the EW(Hα), as well as the inferred specific SFR, appears. Importantly, though, across the entirety of the SFR-M * plane, the absolute SFR as traced by Hα is always centrally peaked, even in galaxies below the MS. },

  abstract      = {We combine molecular gas masses inferred from CO emission in 500 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) between z = 0 and 3, from the IRAM-COLDGASS, PHIBSS1/2, and other surveys, with gas masses derived from Herschel far-IR dust measurements in 512 galaxy stacks over the same stellar mass/redshift range. We constrain the scaling relations of molecular gas depletion timescale (t $_{depl}$) and gas to stellar mass ratio (M $_{mol gas}$/M$_{*}$ ) of SFGs near the star formation ``main-sequence'' with redshift, specific star-formation rate (sSFR), and stellar mass (M$_{*}$ ). The CO- and dust-based scaling relations agree remarkably well. This suggests that the CO {\rarr} H$_{2}$ mass conversion factor varies little within {\plusmn}0.6 dex of the main sequence (sSFR(ms, z, M $_{*}$)), and less than 0.3 dex throughout this redshift range. This study builds on and strengthens the results of earlier work. We find that t $_{depl}$ scales as (1 + z)$^{-0.3}$ {\times} (sSFR/sSFR(ms, z, M $_{*}$))$^{-0.5}$, with little dependence on M $_{*}$. The resulting steep redshift dependence of M $_{mol gas}$/M $_{*}$ {\ap} (1 + z)$^{3}$ mirrors that of the sSFR and probably reflects the gas supply rate. The decreasing gas fractions at high M$_{*}$ are driven by the flattening of the SFR-M $_{*}$ relation. Throughout the probed redshift range a combination of an increasing gas fraction and a decreasing depletion timescale causes a larger sSFR at constant M $_{*}$. As a result, galaxy integrated samples of the M $_{mol gas}$-SFR rate relation exhibit a super-linear slope, which increases with the range of sSFR. With these new relations it is now possible to determine M $_{mol gas}$ with an accuracy of {\plusmn}0.1 dex in relative terms, and {\plusmn}0.2 dex including systematic uncertainties.

  abstract      = {We investigate whether the Hubble sequence can be reproduced by the relics of merger events. We verify that, at z$_{median}$ = 0.65, the abundant population of anomalous starbursts - i.e. with peculiar morphologies and abnormal kinematics - is mainly linked to the local spirals. Their morphologies are dominated by young stars and are intimately related to their ionised-gas kinematics. We show that both morphologies and kinematics can be reproduced by using gas modelling from Barnes' (2002, MNRAS, 333, 481) study of major mergers. Their gas content may be indirectly evaluated by assuming that distant starbursts follow the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation: the median gas fraction is found to be 31\%. Using our modelling to estimate the gas-to-star transformation during a merger, we identify the gas fraction in the progenitors to be generally above 50\%. All distant and massive starbursts can be distributed along a temporal sequence from the first passage to the nuclei fusion and then to the disk rebuilding phase. This later phase has been recently illustrated for J033245.11-274724.0, a distant compact galaxy dominated by a red, dust-enshrouded disk. This active production of rebuilt disks is in excellent agreement with model predictions for gaseous rich encounters. It confirms that the rebuilding spiral disk scenario - a strong and recent reprocessing of most disks by major mergers - is possibly an important channel for the formation of present-day disks in grand-design spirals. Because half of the present-day spirals had peculiar morphologies and anomalous kinematics at z$_{median}$ = 0.65, they could indeed have been in major merger phases 6 Gyr ago, and almost all at z \~{} 1. It is time now to study in detail the formation of spiral disks and of their substructures, including bulge, disks, arms, bars and rings that may mainly originate from instabilities created during the last major merger. Many galaxies also show a helicoidal structure, which is probably due to a central torque, and seems to play an important role in regulating the angular momentum of the newly-formed disks.

Models including both galactic winds and metal cooling (i) suppress early star formation at z {\gsim} 1 and predict reasonable star formation histories for galaxies in present-day haloes of {\lsim}10$^{12}$ M$_{⊙}$, (ii) produce galaxies with high cold gas fractions (30-60 per cent) at high redshift, (iii) significantly reduce the galaxy formation efficiencies for haloes (M$_{halo}$ {\lsim} 10$^{12}$ M$_{⊙}$) at all redshifts in overall good agreement with recent observational data and constraints from abundance matching, (iv) result in high-redshift galaxies with reduced circular velocities in agreement with the observed Tully-Fisher relation at z {\tilde} 2 and (v) significantly increase the sizes of low-mass galaxies (M$_{stellar}$ {\lsim} 3 {\times} 10$^{10}$ M$_{⊙}$) at high redshift resulting in a weak size evolution - a trend in agreement with observations. However, the low-redshift (z $\lt$ 0.5) star formation rates of more massive galaxies are higher than observed (up to 10 times). No tested model predicts the observed size evolution for low-mass and high-mass galaxies simultaneously. Without winds the sizes of low-mass galaxies evolve rapidly, and with winds the size evolution of massive galaxies is too weak. Due to the delayed onset of star formation in the wind models, the metal enrichment of gas and stars is delayed and agrees well with observational constraints. Metal cooling and stellar winds are both found to increase the ratio of in situ formed to accreted stars - the relative importance of dissipative versus dissipationless assembly. For halo masses below {\tilde}10$^{12}$ M$_{⊙}$, this is mainly caused by less stellar accretion and compares well to predictions from semi-analytical models and but differs from abundance matching models as the in situ formed fractions of stellar mass are still too low in the simulations. For higher masses, however, the fraction of in situ stars is overpredicted due to the unrealistically high star formation rates at low redshifts.},

Our laser guide star adaptive optics and good seeing data show the presence of turbulent rotating star-forming outer rings/disks, plus central bulge/inner disk components, whose mass fractions relative to the total dynamical mass appear to scale with the [N II]/H{$\alpha$} flux ratio and the star formation age. We propose that the buildup of the central disks and bulges of massive galaxies at z \~{} 2 can be driven by the early secular evolution of gas-rich proto-disks. High-redshift disks exhibit large random motions. This turbulence may in part be stirred up by the release of gravitational energy in the rapid ``cold'' accretion flows along the filaments of the cosmic web. As a result, dynamical friction and viscous processes proceed on a timescale of $\lt$1 Gyr, at least an order of magnitude faster than in z \~{} 0 disk galaxies. Early secular evolution thus drives gas and stars into the central regions and can build up exponential disks and massive bulges, even without major mergers. Secular evolution along with increased efficiency of star formation at high surface densities may also help to account for the short timescales of the stellar buildup observed in massive galaxies at z \~{} 2.

The principal new observational results are as follows: (1) As a class, the emission-line spectra of tepid FIRGs are most similar to LINERs, but about half are intermediate between LINERs and low-excitation H II regions. The sample as a whole bears a strong spectroscopic resemblance to the well-known M82 filaments.

  abstract = {We present the results of axisymmetric time-dependent hydrodynamic calculations of line-driven winds from accretion disks in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We assume the disk is flat, Keplerian, geometrically thin, and optically thick, radiating according to the {$\alpha$}-disk prescription. The central engine of the AGN is a source of both ionizing X-rays and wind-driving UV photons. To calculate the radiation force, we take into account radiation from the disk and the central engine. The gas temperature and ionization state in the wind are calculated self-consistently from the photoionization and heating rate of the central engine. We find that a disk accreting onto a 10$^{8}$ M$_{solar}$ black hole at the rate of 1.8 M$_{solar}$ yr$^{-1}$ can launch a wind at \~{}10$^{16}$ cm from the central engine. The X-rays from the central object are significantly attenuated by the disk atmosphere so they cannot prevent the local disk radiation from pushing matter away from the disk. However, in the supersonic portion of the flow high above the disk, the X-rays can overionize the gas and decrease the wind terminal velocity. For a reasonable X-ray opacity, e.g., {$\kappa$}$_{X}$=40 g$^{-1}$ cm$^{2}$, the disk wind can be accelerated by the central UV radiation to velocities of up to 15,000 km s$^{-1}$ at a distance of \~{}10$^{17}$ cm from the central engine. The covering factor of the disk wind is \~{}0.2. The wind is unsteady and consists of an opaque, slow vertical flow near the disk that is bounded on the polar side by a high-velocity stream. A typical column density through the fast stream is a few times 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ so the stream is optically thin to the UV radiation. This low column density is precisely why gas can be accelerated to high velocities. The fast stream contributes nearly 100\% to the total wind mass-loss rate of 0.5 M$_{solar}$ yr$^{-1}$.},

We find a fairly sharp onset of the incidence of broad nuclear emission (FWHM in the H{$\alpha$}, [N II], and [S II] lines \~{}450-5300 km s$^{-1}$), with large [N II]/H{$\alpha$} ratios, above log(M $_{*}$/M $_{⊙}$) \~{} 10.9, with about two-thirds of the galaxies in this mass range exhibiting this component. Broad nuclear components near and above the Schechter mass are similarly prevalent above and below the main sequence of star-forming galaxies, and at z \~{} 1 and \~{}2. The line ratios of the nuclear component are fit by excitation from active galactic nuclei (AGNs), or by a combination of shocks and photoionization. The incidence of the most massive galaxies with broad nuclear components is at least as large as that of AGNs identified by X-ray, optical, infrared, or radio indicators. The mass loading of the nuclear outflows is near unity. Our findings provide compelling evidence for powerful, high-duty cycle, AGN-driven outflows near the Schechter mass, and acting across the peak of cosmic galaxy formation.

  abstract      = {We report the detection of ubiquitous powerful nuclear outflows in massive ($\gt$=10$^{11}$ M $_{⊙}$) z \~{} 2 star-forming galaxies (SFGs), which are plausibly driven by an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The sample consists of the eight most massive SFGs from our SINS/zC-SINF survey of galaxy kinematics with the imaging spectrometer SINFONI, six of which have sensitive high-resolution adaptive optics-assisted observations. All of the objects are disks hosting a significant stellar bulge. The spectra in their central regions exhibit a broad component in H{$\alpha$} and forbidden [N II] and [S II] line emission, with typical velocity FWHM \~{} 1500 km s$^{-1}$, [N II]/H{$\alpha$} ratio {\ap} 0.6, and intrinsic extent of 2-3 kpc. These properties are consistent with warm ionized gas outflows associated with Type 2 AGN, the presence of which is confirmed via independent diagnostics in half the galaxies. The data imply a median ionized gas mass outflow rate of \~{}60 M $_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$ and mass loading of \~{}3. At larger radii, a weaker broad component is detected but with lower FWHM \~{}485 km s$^{-1}$ and [N II]/H{$\alpha$} {\ap} 0.35, characteristic for star formation-driven outflows as found in the lower-mass SINS/zC-SINF galaxies. The high inferred mass outflow rates and frequent occurrence suggest that the nuclear outflows efficiently expel gas out of the centers of the galaxies with high duty cycles and may thus contribute to the process of star formation quenching in massive galaxies. Larger samples at high masses will be crucial in confirming the importance and energetics of the nuclear outflow phenomenon and its connection to AGN activity and bulge growth.

It is found that the data provide both qualitative and quantitative support for the 'superwind' model in which the kinetic energy provided by SNe and winds from massive stars in a central starburst drives a large-scale outflow that can shock heat and accelerate ambient interstellar and circumgalactic gas. Clear kinematic signatures of an outflow along the galaxy's minor axis are found for the three nearest far-IR galaxies (FIRGs). The FIRG nebulae are highly overpressured relative to the Galactic ISM, with the pressure dropping systematically with distance from the nucleus. Superwinds are energetically adequate to power both the observed optical and X-ray nebulae, and the relative emission-line intensities and their radial variations are consistent with ionization by wind-driven shocks, but not with photoionization by normal O stars or an AGN. The possible astrophysical implications of superwinds are discussed.},

  abstract      = {A six-dimensional parameter space based on high-resolution numerical simulations of isolated binary galaxy collisions has been constructed to investigate the dynamical friction timescales, $\tau\_{\rm mer}$, for major mergers. Our experiments follow the gravitational encounters between $\sim 600$ pairs of similarly massive late- and early-type galaxies with orbital parameters compliant to the predictions of the LambdaCDM cosmology. We analyze the performance of different schemes for tracking the secular evolution of mergers, finding that the product of the intergalactic distance and velocity is best suited to identify the time of coalescence. In contrast, a widely used merger time estimator such as the exhaustion of the orbital spin is shown to systematically underpredict $\tau\_ {\rm mer}$, resulting in relative errors that can reach 60\% for nearly radial encounters. Regarding the internal spins of the progenitors, we find that they can lead to total variations in the merger times above 30\% in highly circular encounters, whereas only that of the principal halo is capable of modulating the strength of the interaction prevailing throughout a merger. The comparison of our simulated merger times with predictions from different variants of a well-known fitting formula has revealed an only partially satisfactory agreement, which has led us to recalculate the values of the coefficients of these expressions to obtain relations that fit perfectly major mergers. The observed biases between data and predictions, that do not only apply to the present work, are inconsistent with expectations from differences in the degree of idealization of the collisions, their metric, spin-related biases, or the simulation set-up. This hints to a certain lack of accuracy of the dynamical friction modelling, arising perhaps from a still not quite complete identification of the parameters governing orbital decay.},

  abstract      = {In models of galaxy formation, feedback driven both by supernova (SN) and active galactic nucleus (AGN) is not efficient enough to quench star formation in massive galaxies. Models of smaller galaxies have suggested that cosmic rays (CRs) play a major role in expelling material from the star forming regions by diffusing SN energy to the lower density outskirts. We therefore run gas dynamical simulations of galactic outflows from a galaxy contained in a halo with $5\times10^{12}$\~{}M$\_{\odot}$ that resembles a local ultraluminous galaxy, including both SN thermal energy and a treatment of CRs using the same diffusion approximation as Salem {\amp} Bryan. We find that CR pressure drives a low-density bubble beyond the edge of the shell swept up by thermal pressure, but the main bubble driven by SN thermal pressure overtakes it later, which creates a large-scale biconical outflow. CRs diffusing into the disk are unable to entrain its gas in the outflows, yielding a mass-loading rate of only $\sim0.1~\\%$ with varied CR diffusion coefficients. We find no significant difference in mass-loading rates in SN driven outflows with or without CR pressure. Our simulations strongly suggest that it is hard to drive a heavily mass-loaded outflow with CRs from a massive halo potential, although more distributed star formation could lead to a different result.},

  abstract      = {Photoionizing radiation and stellar winds from massive stars deposit energy and momentum into the interstellar medium (ISM). They might disperse the local ISM, change its turbulent multi-phase structure, and even regulate star formation. Ionizing radiation dominates the massive stars' energy output, but the relative effect of winds might change with stellar mass and the properties of the ambient ISM. We present simulations of the interaction of stellar winds and ionizing radiation of 12, 23, and 60 M$\_{\odot}$ stars within a cold neutral (CNM, $n\_{0}$ = 100 cm$^{-3}$), warm neutral (WNM, $n\_{0}$ = 1, 10 cm$^{-3}$) or warm ionized (WIM, $n\_{0}$ = 0.1 cm$^{-3}$) medium. The FLASH simulations adopt the novel tree-based radiation transfer algorithm TreeRay. With the On-the-Spot approximation and a temperature-dependent recombination coefficient, it is coupled to a chemical network with radiative heating and cooling. In the homogeneous CNM, the total momentum injection ranges from 1.6$\times$10$^{4}$ to 4$\times$10$^{5}$ M$\_{\odot}$ km s$^{-1}$ and is always dominated by the expansion of the ionized H$\_{\text{II}}$ region. In the WIM, stellar winds dominate (2$\times$10$^{2}$ to 5$\times$10$^{3}$ M$\_{\odot}$ km s$^{-1}$), while the input from radiation is small ($\sim$ 10$^{2}$ M$\_{\odot}$ km s$^{-1}$). The WNM ($n\_{0}$ = 1 cm$^{-3}$) is a transition regime. Energetically, stellar winds couple more efficiently to the ISM ($\sim$ 0.1 percent of wind luminosity) than radiation ($\lt$ 0.001 percent of ionizing luminosity). For estimating the impact of massive stars, the strongly mass-dependent ratios of wind to ionizing luminosity and the properties of the ambient medium have to be considered.},

The molecular gas is aligned with the stellar component, and we see no evidence of strong gas outflows.

  abstract = {We describe the GALFORM semi-analytic model for calculating the formation and evolution of galaxies in hierarchical clustering cosmologies. It improves upon, and extends, the earlier scheme developed by Cole et al. The model employs a new Monte Carlo algorithm to follow the merging evolution of dark matter haloes with arbitrary mass resolution. It incorporates realistic descriptions of the density profiles of dark matter haloes and the gas they contain; it follows the chemical evolution of gas and stars, and the associated production of dust; and it includes a detailed calculation of the sizes of discs and spheroids. Wherever possible, our prescriptions for modelling individual physical processes are based on results of numerical simulations. They require a number of adjustable parameters, which we fix by reference to a small subset of local galaxy data. This results in a fully specified model of galaxy formation which can be tested against other data. We apply our methods to the {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology f$_{12}$(M$_{1}$,M$_{2}$) dM$_{1}$ [1/{\surd}2{$\pi$}] [({$\delta$}$_{c1}$ - {$\delta$}$_{c2}$)/ ({$\sigma$}$^{2}$$_{1}$ - {$\sigma$}$^{2}$$_{2}$)$^{3/2}$] x exp [-({$\delta$}$_{c1}$ - {$\delta$}$_{c2}$)$^{2}$/ 2({$\sigma$}$^{2}$$_{2}$)] [d{$\sigma$}$^{2}$$_{1}$/dM$_{1}$] d M$_{1}$ ({$\Omega$}$_{0}$=0.3) (df$_{12}$)/(dt$_{1}$ t$_{1}$t$_{2}$) dM$_{1}$ dt$_{1}$ [1/{\surd}(2{$\pi$})] [1 / {$\sigma$}$^{2}$$_{1}$ - {$\sigma$}$^{2}$$_{2}$)$^{3/2}$] [d{$\delta$}$_{c1}$/dt$_{1}$] [d{$\sigma$}$^{2}$$_{1}$/dM$_{1}$] dM$_{1}$ dt$_{1}$ {$\Lambda$}$_{0}$=0.7),-$\gt$ and find good agreement with a wide range of properties of the local galaxy population: the B- and K-band luminosity functions, the distribution of colours for the population as a whole, the ratio of ellipticals to spirals, the distribution of disc sizes, and the current cold gas content of discs. In spite of the overall success of the model, some interesting discrepancies remain: the colour-magnitude relation for ellipticals in clusters is significantly flatter than observed at bright magnitudes (although the scatter is about right), and the model predicts galaxy circular velocities, at a given luminosity, that are about 30per cent larger than is observed. It is unclear whether these discrepancies represent fundamental shortcomings of the model, or whether they result from the various approximations and uncertainties inherent in the technique. Our more detailed methods do not change our earlier conclusion that just over half the stars in the Universe are expected to have formed since [dN/dM$_{1}$] [df$_{12}$/dt$_{1}$] [M$_{2}$/M$_{1}$] dt$_{1}$ (M$_{1}$ $\lt$ M$_{2}$). z $\lt$\~{}1.5.},

Our results are consistent with observed galaxy stellar mass functions, specific star formation rates (SSFRs), and cosmic star formation rates (CSFRs) from z = 0 to z = 8. We consider the effects of a wide range of uncertainties on our results, including those affecting stellar masses, SFRs, and the halo mass function at the heart of our analysis. As they are relevant to our method, we also present new calibrations of the dark matter halo mass function, halo mass accretion histories, and halo-subhalo merger rates out to z = 8. We also provide new compilations of CSFRs and SSFRs; more recent measurements are now consistent with the buildup of the cosmic stellar mass density at all redshifts. Implications of our work include: halos near 10$^{12}$ M $_{⊙}$ are the most efficient at forming stars at all redshifts, the baryon conversion efficiency of massive halos drops markedly after z \~{} 2.5 (consistent with theories of cold-mode accretion), the ICL for massive galaxies is expected to be significant out to at least z \~{} 1-1.5, and dwarf galaxies at low redshifts have higher stellar mass to halo mass ratios than previous expectations and form later than in most theoretical models. Finally, we provide new fitting formulae for SFHs that are more accurate than the standard declining tau model. Our approach places a wide variety of observations relating to the SFH of galaxies into a self-consistent framework based on the modern understanding of structure formation in {$\Lambda$}CDM.

  abstract    = {We investigate the galaxy quenching process at intermediate redshift using a sample of $\sim4400$ galaxies with $M_{\ast} > 10^{9}M_{\odot}$ between redshift 0.5 and 1.0 in all five CANDELS fields. We divide this sample, using the integrated specific star formation rate (sSFR), into four sub-groups: star-forming galaxies (SFGs) above and below the ridge of the star-forming main sequence (SFMS), transition galaxies and quiescent galaxies. We study their $UVI$ ($U-V$ versus $V-I$) color gradients to infer their sSFR gradients out to twice effective radii. We show that on average both star-forming and transition galaxies at all masses are not fully quenched at any radii, whereas quiescent galaxies are fully quenched at all radii. We find that at low masses ($M_{\ast} = 10^{9}-10^{10}M_{\odot}$) SFGs both above and below the SFMS ridge generally have flat sSFR profiles, whereas the transition galaxies at the same masses generally have sSFRs that are more suppressed in their outskirts. In contrast, at high masses ($M_{\ast} > 10^{10.5}M_{\odot}$), SFGs above and below the SFMS ridge and transition galaxies generally have varying degrees of more centrally-suppressed sSFRs relative to their outskirts. These findings indicate that at $z\sim~0.5-1.0$ the main galaxy quenching mode depends on its already formed stellar mass, exhibiting a transition from "the outside-in" at $M_{\ast} \leq 10^{10}M_{\odot}$ to "the inside-out" at $M_{\ast} > 10^{10.5}M_{\odot}$. In other words, our findings support that internal processes dominate the quenching of massive galaxies, whereas external processes dominate the quenching of low-mass galaxies.},

Combined with the complementary information provided by our ground-based spectroscopy, the HST images show that the warm gas outflows are relatively compact for most of the objects in the sample: in three objects the outflow regions are barely resolved at the resolution of HST ($0.065 < R_{[OIII]} < 0.12$ kpc); in a further four cases the outflows are spatially resolved but with flux weighted mean radii in the range $0.65 < R_{[OIII]} < 1.2$ kpc; and in only one object (Mrk273) is there clear evidence for a more extended outflow, with a maximum extent of $R_{[OIII]}\sim5$ kpc. Overall, our observations show little evidence for the galaxy-wide outflows predicted by some models of AGN feedback.},

  abstract      = {The Galactic Bulge can uniquely be studied from large samples of individual stars, and is therefore of prime importance for understanding the stellar population structure of bulges in general. Here the observational evidence on the kinematics, chemical composition, and ages of Bulge stellar populations based on photometric and spectroscopic data is reviewed. The bulk of Bulge stars are old and span a metallicity range -1.5$\lt$\~{}[Fe/H]$\lt$\~{}+0.5. Stellar populations and chemical properties suggest a star formation timescale below \~{}2 Gyr. The overall Bulge is barred and follows cylindrical rotation, and the more metal-rich stars trace a Box/Peanut (B/P) structure. Dynamical models demonstrate the different spatial and orbital distributions of metal-rich and metal-poor stars. We discuss current Bulge formation scenarios based on dynamical, chemical, chemodynamical and cosmological models. Despite impressive progress we do not yet have a successful fully self-consistent chemodynamical Bulge model in the cosmological framework, and we will also need more extensive chrono-chemical-kinematic 3D map of stars to better constrain such models.},

  abstract      = {We observed Brackett $\alpha$ 4.05$\mu$m emission towards the supernebula in NGC 5253 with NIRSPEC on Keck II in adaptive optics mode, NIRSPAO, to probe feedback from its exciting embedded super star cluster (SSC). NIRSPEC's Slit-Viewing Camera was simultaneously used to image the K-band continuum at $\sim$$0.1''$ resolution. We register the IR continuum with HST imaging, and find that the visible clusters are offset from the K-band peak, which coincides with the Br $\alpha$ peak of the supernebula and its associated molecular cloud. The spectra of the supernebula exhibit Br $\alpha$ emission with a strong, narrow core. The linewidths are 65-76 km s$^{-1}$, FWHM, comparable to those around individual ultra-compact HII regions within our Galaxy. A weak, broad (FWHM$\simeq$150-175 km s$^{-1}$) component is detected on the base of the line, which could trace a population of sources with high-velocity winds. The core velocity of Br $\alpha$ emission shifts by +13 km s$^{-1}$ from NE to SW across the supernebula, possibly indicating a bipolar outflow from an embedded object, or linked to a foreground redshifted gas filament. The results can be explained if the supernebula comprises thousands of ionized wind regions around individual massive stars, stalled in their expansion due to critical radiative cooling and unable to merge to drive a coherent cluster wind. Based on the absence of an outflow with large mass loss, we conclude that feedback is currently ineffective at dispersing gas, and the SSC retains enriched material out of which it may continue to form stars.},

We explore two matched sets of cosmological zoom-in runs of 24 halos with masses \~{}$10^{12.0}-10^{13.4}$ M\_sun run with two different feedback models. Our `NoAGN' model includes stellar feedback via UV heating, stellar winds and supernovae, photoelectric heating and cosmic X-ray background heating from a meta-galactic background. Our fiducial `MrAGN' model is identical except that it also includes a model for black hole seeding and accretion, as well as heating and momentum injection associated with the radiation from black hole accretion. Our MrAGN model launches galactic outflows which result in both `ejective' feedback - the outflows themselves which drive gas out of galaxies - and `preventative' feedback, which suppresses the inflow of new and recycling gas. As much as 80 \% of outflowing galactic gas can be expelled, and accretion can be suppressed by as much as a factor of 30 in the MrAGN runs when compared with the NoAGN runs. The histories of NoAGN galaxies are recycling-dominated, with \~{}70\% of material that leaves the galaxy eventually returning, and the majority of outflowing gas re-accretes on 1 Gyr timescales without AGN feedback. Outflowing gas in the MrAGN runs has higher characteristic velocity (500 - 1,000 km/s versus 100-300 km/s for outflowing NoAGN gas) and travels as far as a few Mpcs. Only \~{}10\% of ejected material is re-accreted in the MrAGN galaxies.},

  abstract      = {Since the discovery that the majority of low-redshift galaxies exhibit some level of spiral structure, a number of theories have been proposed as to why these patterns exist. A popular explanation is a process known as swing amplification, yet there is no observational evidence to prove that such a mechanism is at play. By using a number of measured properties of galaxies, and scaling relations where there are no direct measurements, we model samples of SDSS and S$^4$G spiral galaxies in terms of their relative halo, bulge and disc mass and size. Using these models, we test predictions of swing amplification theory with respect to directly measured spiral arm numbers from Galaxy Zoo 2. We find that neither a universal cored or cuspy inner dark matter profile can correctly predict observed numbers of arms in galaxies. However, by invoking a halo contraction/expansion model, a clear bimodality in the spiral galaxy population emerges. Approximately 40 per cent of unbarred spiral galaxies at $z \lesssim 0.1$ and $\mathrm{M\_*} \gtrsim 10^{10} \mathrm{M\_\odot}$ have spiral arms that can be modelled by swing amplification. This population display a significant correlation between predicted and observed spiral arm numbers, evidence that they are swing amplified modes. The remainder are dominated by two-arm systems for which the model predicts significantly higher arm numbers. These are likely driven by tidal interactions or other mechanisms.},

When choosing the 14 BAL and mini-BALs comprising this sample, the data did not cover the S IV and S IV* troughs, whose ratio can be used to determine the distance of the outflows from the central source (R). Therefore, this ``Blind Survey'' is unbiased towards a particular distance scale. Out of the eight outflows where R can be measured, six have R $\gt$ 100 pc (spanning the range 100-4500 pc), one has R $\gt$ 10 pc, and only one (at R $\lt$ 60 pc) is compatible with a much smaller R scale. At least two of the outflows have a kinetic luminosity greater than 0.5\% of their Eddington luminosity, implying that they are able to provide significant AGN feedback. The outflows span a range of 0 to -10000 km s$^{-1}$ in velocity; total column density between 10$^{20}$ - 10$^{22.5}$ cm$^{-2}$ ; ionization parameter ($U\_H$ ) in the range 0.01 - 1; and electron number density between 10$^3$ - 10$^{5.5}$ cm$^{-3}$ , with one upper and one lower limit. The results of this survey can be extrapolated to the majority of BAL outflows, implying that most of these outflows are situated far away from the AGN accretion disk; and that a significant portion of them can contribute to AGN feedback processes.},

  abstract      = {Galactic-scale outflows regulate the stellar mass growth and chemical enrichment of galaxies, yet key outflow properties such as the chemical composition and mass loss rate remain largely unknown. We address these physical properties with rest-frame ultraviolet spectra of nine gravitationally lensed z=2-3 star forming galaxies taken with Keck/ESI. Using transitions spanning a range of optical depths and atomic elements, we study the kinematics, covering fractions, and composition of the interstellar medium in our sample. The interstellar medium seen in absorption is dominated by outflowing material, with typical velocities -150 km/s. Approximately 80\% of the total column density is associated with a net outflow. Mass loss rates in the low ionization phase are comparable to or in excess of the star formation rate, with total outflow rates likely higher when accounting for ionized gas. Of order half of the heavy element yield from star formation is ejected in the low ionization phase, confirming that outflows play a critical role in regulating galaxy chemical evolution. Covering fractions vary and are in general non-uniform, with most galaxies having incomplete covering by the low ions across all velocities. Our sample spans an order of magnitude in column density yet ionic abundance patterns show remarkably little scatter, revealing a distinct ``chemical fingerprint'' of outflows. Gas phase Si abundances are significantly super-solar relative to Fe and Ni ([Si/Fe]$\gtrsim$0.4), indicating a combination of $\alpha$-enhancement and dust depletion. Derived properties are comparable to the most kinematically broad, metal-rich, and depleted DLAs at similar redshifts, suggesting that these extreme systems are associated with galactic outflows at small impact parameters. We discuss implications of the abundance patterns in z=2-3 galaxies and the role of outflows at this epoch.},

  abstract    = {As part of the QUADROS project to quantify the impact of AGN-driven outflows in rapidly evolving galaxies in the local universe, we present observations of 8 nearby ULIRGs ($0.04 < z < 0.2$) taken with the ISIS spectrograph on the \textit{William Herschel Telescope} (WHT), and also summarise the results of the project as a whole. Consistent with \cite{Rose2018}, we find that the outflow regions are compact (0.08 < $R_{[OIII]}$ < 1.5 kpc), and the electron densities measured using the [SII], [OII] trans-auroral emission-line ratios are relatively high (2.5 < log n$_{e}$(cm$^{-3}$) < 4.5, median log n$_{e}$(cm$^{-3})\sim 3.1$). Many of the outflow regions are also significantly reddened (median E(B-V) $\sim$ 0.5). Assuming that the de-projected outflow velocities are represented by the 5$\rm^{th}$ percentile velocities ($v_{05}$) of the broad, blueshifted components of [OIII]$\lambda$5007, we calculate relatively modest mass outflow rates ($0.1 < \dot{M} < 20$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, median $\dot{M}$ $\sim$ 2 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$), and find kinetic powers as a fraction of the AGN bolometric luminosity ($\dot{F} = \dot{E}/L_{bol}$) in the range 0.02 < $\dot{F}$ < 3 \%, median $\dot{F}$ $\sim$ 0.3 \%). The latter estimates are in line with the predictions of multi-stage outflow models, or single-stage models in which only a modest fraction of the initial kinetic power of the inner disk winds is transferred to the larger-scale outflows. Considering the QUADROS sample as a whole, we find no clear evidence for correlations between the properties of the outflows and the bolometric luminosities of the AGN, albeit based on a sample that covers a relatively small range in $L_{bol}$. Overall, our results suggest that there is a significant intrinsic scatter in outflow properties of ULIRGs for a given AGN luminosity.},

Here we perform a suite of three hydrodynamic simulations to investigate whether AGN jets could drive these metal-rich outflows in a representative cluster. By using both the tracer variable and virtual particle methods, and additionally following the gas metallicity evolution, we show that metal-rich gas initially located in central regions can indeed be uplifted by the AGN bubble to large distances, a phenomenon called Darwin drift in fluid mechanics, and forming a filamentary trailing outflow extending beyond 100 kpc behind the bubble. The gas entrained in the trailing outflow is entirely outflowing with an average outflow rate of nearly 100M\_soalr/yr during the first 100 Myr, and at later times, a growing lower part flows back towards the cluster center due to gravity. The outflow mass rises up to about 10\^{}10M\_solar, consistent with observations and predictions from the drift model, and by the end of our simulation (\~{}800 Myr after the AGN event), several 10\^{}9M\_soalr of the uplifted high-metallicity gas still remains at large altitudes, potentially contributing to the enrichment of the bulk ICM and the broadening of central metallicity peaks observed in cool core clusters.},

  abstract    = {Recent observations have found extended multi-phase gas in a significant fraction of massive elliptical galaxies. We perform high-resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of two idealized elliptical galaxies -- one representing a typical galaxy characterized by initial conditions conducive to the development of thermal instability and the other one less likely to develop thermal instability -- in order to study the development of thermal instability and the formation of multi-phase structures. We analyze the interplay between radiative cooling, momentum-driven AGN feedback, star formation, and stellar feedback from both young and old stars. We find that in one class of elliptical galaxies, the entropy of the hot halo gas rises sharply as a function of radius, and the hot halo is thermally stable and run-away cooling can only happen in the very center of the galaxy. In other class of ellipticals, the hot halo gas has a cooling to free-fall time ratio close to 10, and the non-linear perturbation driven by AGN feedback can cause the hot gas to frequently precipitate into extended multi-phase filaments. Both multi- and single-phase elliptical galaxies experience cooling-driven AGN feedback cycles. Interestingly, AGN feedback maintains the multi- or single-phase nature of the halo but does not turn multi-phase galaxies into single-phase ones or vice versa. Some of the extended cold gas in the multi-phase galaxy also forms young stars. The level of star formation and its spatial distribution are in excellent agreement with {\it Hubble} observations of nearby elliptical galaxies.},

  abstract    = {The Hubble sequence provides a useful classification of galaxy morphology at low redshift. However, morphologies are not static, but rather evolve as the growth of structure proceeds through mergers, accretion and secular processes. We investigate how kinematically defined disc and spheroidal structures form and evolve in the EAGLE hydrodynamic simulation of galaxy formation. At high redshift most galaxies of all masses are asymmetric. By redshift $z\simeq 1.5$ the Hubble sequence is established and after this time most of the stellar mass is in spheroids whose contribution to the stellar mass budget continues to rise to the present day. The stellar mass fraction in discs peaks at $z\simeq 0.5$ but overall remains subdominant at all times although discs contribute most of the stellar mass in systems of mass $M^*\sim 10^{10.5}{\rm M_\odot}$ at $z \leq 1.5$. Star formation occurs predominantly in disc structures throughout most of cosmic time but morphological transformations rearrange stars, thus establishing the low-redshift morphological mix. Morphological transformations are common and we quantify the rates at which they occur. The rate of growth of spheroids decreases at $z < 2$ while the rate of decay of discs remains roughly constant at $z < 1$. Finally, we find that the prograde component of galaxies becomes increasingly dynamically cold with time.},

The prevalence of optical/radio-loud AGNs is found to be similar for centrals and satellites at given stellar masses.

We detect a parsec-sized, bipolar, and high velocity outflow in all the lines, which allow us, in combination with the existing CO J = 2--1 data, to perform a multi-line analysis of physical conditions of the outflowing gas. The CO 7--6/6--5, 6--5/3--2, and 6--5/2--1 ratios are found to be nearly constant over a velocity range of $\sim$5--25 km s$^{-1}$ for both blueshifted and redshifted lobes. We carry out rotation diagram and large velocity gradient (LVG) calculations of the four lines, and find that the outflow is approximately isothermal with a gas temperature of $\sim$50 K, and that the the CO column density clearly decreases with the outflow velocity. If the CO abundance and the velocity gradient do not vary much, the decreasing CO column density indicates a decline in the outflow gas density with velocity. By comparing with theoretical models of outflow driving mechanisms, our observations and calculations suggest that the massive outflow in G240.31+0.07 is being driven by a wide-angle wind and further support a disk mediated accretion at play for the formation of the central high-mass star.},

  title       = {Bar resilience to flybys in a cosmological framework},
  abstract    = {It has been proposed that close interactions with satellite galaxies can significantly perturb the morphology of the main galaxy. However, the dynamics of an already formed bar following the interaction with the external environment has not been studied in detail. In this letter, analyzing the cosmological zoom-in simulation Eris2k, we study the effects that a very unequal-mass flyby crossing the stellar disc has on the stability of the pre-existing bar. We characterise the evolution of the bar strength and length showing that the perturbation exerted by the flyby shuffles the orbits of stars for less than one Gyr. After this time, the bar shows a remarkable resilience, reforming with properties comparable to those it had before the interaction. Our work shows that close unequal-mass encounters, the most frequent interactions occurring during the evolution of cosmic structures, have (i) an overall minor impact on the global evolution of the bar in the long term, still (ii) the effect is destructive and (iii) a very weak interaction is sufficient to dismantle a strong bar leading to its "apparent death".},

  title        = {Evolution of the Outflows in NGC 3516},
  abstract     = {We analyze the 2011 HST/COS spectrum of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3516, which demonstrates clear changes in one of the intrinsic absorption troughs (component 5), slight evidence of change in a second trough (component 6), and the appearance of a new absorption trough (component 9). We interpret both the changes and the appearance of the new trough as bulk motion across the line of sight. The implied lower limit on the transverse velocity of component 5 is 360 km/s, compared to the earlier 2001 HST/STIS spectrum, while the lower limits for components 6 and 9 are 920 km/s, based on 2009 FUSE data. Component 5 also exhibits a shift in velocity centroid. This is only the second known case of this behavior in a Seyfert galaxy. Due to the high quality of the HST/COS spectrum, we identify a previously undetected trough due to an excited state of Si II for component 1. In combination with the resonance trough of Si II and photoionization modeling, we directly determine the distance of the component 1 outflow to be 67.2 pc.},

In this letter, we explore the impact of ATC on the prevalence of cool-cores (CCs) using 12 pairs of magnetohydrodynamical galaxy cluster simulations, simulated using the IllustrisTNG model with and without ATC. Although the impact of ATC varies from cluster to cluster and with CC criterion, its inclusion produces a systematic shift to larger CC fractions at z = 0 for all CC criteria considered. Additionally, the inclusion of ATC yields a flatter CC fraction redshift evolution, easing the tension with the observed evolution. With ATC included, the energy required for the central black hole to achieve self-regulation is reduced and the gas fraction in the cluster core increases, resulting in larger CC fractions. ATC makes the ICM unstable to perturbations and the increased efficiency of AGN feedback suggests that its inclusion results in a greater level of mixing in the ICM. Therefore, ATC is potentially an important physical process in reproducing the thermal structure of the ICM.},

  abstract    = {We investigate the clustering properties and close neighbour counts for galaxies with different types of bulges and stellar masses. We select samples of "classical" and "pseudo" bulges, as well as "bulge-less" disk galaxies, based on the bulge/disk decomposition catalog of SDSS galaxies provided by Simard et al. (2011). For a given galaxy sample we estimate: the projected two-point cross-correlation function with respect to a spectroscopic reference sample, w_p(r_p), and the average background-subtracted neighbour count within a projected separation using a photometric reference sample, N_neighbour(<r_p). We compare the results with the measurements of control samples matched in color, concentration and redshift. We find that, when limited to a certain stellar mass range and matched in color and concentration, all the samples present similar clustering amplitudes and neighbour counts on scales above ~0.1h^{-1}Mpc. This indicates that neither the presence of a central bulge, nor the bulge type is related to intermediate-to-large scale environments. On smaller scales, in contrast, pseudo-bulge and pure-disk galaxies similarly show strong excess in close neighbour count when compared to control galaxies, at all masses probed. For classical bulges, small-scale excess is also observed but only for M_stars < 10^{10} M_sun; at higher masses, their neighbour counts are similar to that of control galaxies at all scales. These results imply strong connections between galactic bulges and galaxy-galaxy interactions in the local Universe, although it is unclear how they are physically linked in the current theory of galaxy formation.},

  abstract      = {Late bloomers are massive ($M\_* \gt 10^{10}\,M\_\odot$) galaxies that formed the majority of their stars within $\sim$2 Gyr of the epoch of observation. Our improved methodology for deriving star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies at redshifts $0.45 \lt z \lt 0.75$ from the Carnegie-Spitzer-IMACS Survey includes confidence intervals that robustly distinguish late bloomers from ``old'' galaxies. We use simulated SFHs to test for ``false positives'' and contamination from old galaxies to demonstrate that the late bloomer population is not an artifact of our template modeling technique. We show that late bloomers account for $\sim$20\% of $z\sim0.6$ galaxies with masses of the modern Milky Way, with a moderate dependence on mass. We take advantage of a 1\% overlap of our sample with HST (CANDELS) imaging to construct a ``gold standard'' catalog of 74 galaxies with high-confidence SFHs, SEDs, basic data, and HST images to facilitate comparison with future studies by others. This small subset suggests that galaxies with both old and young SFHs cover the full range of morphology and environment (excluding rich groups or clusters), albeit with a mild but suggestive correlation with local environment. We begin the investigation of whether late bloomers of sufficient mass and frequency are produced in current-generation $\Lambda$CDM-based semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. In terms of halo growth, we find a late-assembling halo fraction within a factor-of-two of our late bloomer fraction. However, sufficiently delaying star formation in such halos may be a challenge for the baryon component of such models.},

  abstract    = {We study molecular outflows in a sample of 45 local galaxies, both star forming and AGN, primarily by using CO data from the ALMA archive and from the literature. For a subsample we also compare the molecular outflow with the ionized and neutral atomic phases. We infer an empirical analytical function relating the outflow rate simultaneously to the SFR, $L_{\rm AGN}$, and galaxy stellar mass; this relation is much tighter than the relations with the individual quantities. The outflow kinetic power shows a larger scatter than in previous studies, spanning from 0.1 to 5~per cent of $L_{\rm AGN}$, while the momentum rate ranges from 1 to 30 times $L_{\rm AGN}/c$, indicating that these outflows can be both energy-driven, but with a broad range of coupling efficiencies with the ISM, and radiation pressure-driven. For about 10~per cent of the objects the outflow properties significantly exceed the maximum theoretical values; we interpret these as "fossil outflows" resulting from activity of a past strong AGN, which has now faded. We estimate that, in the stellar mass range probed here ($>$ 10$^{10}~\rm M_{\odot}$), less than 5~per cent of the outflowing gas escapes the galaxy. The molecular gas depletion time associated with the outflow can be as short as a few million years in powerful AGNs, however the total gas (H$_2$+HI) depletion times are much longer. Altogether, our findings suggest that even AGN-driven outflows might be relatively ineffective in clearing galaxies of their entire gas content, although they are likely capable of clearing and quenching the central region. Finally, we find no correlation between molecular outflow rate and radio power, suggesting that on average radio jets do not play a major role in driving massive molecular outflows in the luminosity range (log($L_{\rm AGN}$) = 41-46 erg s$^{-1}$) probed here.},

We find that the system reaches a quasi-steady state on a Gyr-timescale though with strong temporal fluctuations. Clustered SNe lead to the formation of superbubbles which break out of the disk and vent out hot gas, launching the winds. At the virial radius, the time-averaged loading factors of mass, momentum and energy are 3, 1 and 0.05, respectively, and the metal enrichment factor is 1.5. Winds that escape the halo consist of two populations that differ in their launching temperatures. Hot gas acquires enough kinetic energy to escape when launched while warm gas does not. However, warm gas can be further accelerated by the ram pressure of the subsequently launched hot gas and eventually escape. The strong interactions between different temperature phases highlight the caveat of extrapolating properties of warm gas to large distances based on its local conditions (e.g. the Bernoulli parameter). Our convergence study finds that wind properties converge at $m_{\rm gas}=5 {\rm M_\odot}$ (with an injection mass of $500 {\rm M_\odot}$), and the winds weaken dramatically once the cooling masses of individual SNe become unresolved. We demonstrate that injecting the terminal momentum of SNe (neglecting the residual thermal energy), a popular sub-grid model in the literature, fails to capture pressure-driven winds. The failure owes to its assumption that most thermal energy is radiated away right after injection even for highly clustered SNe.},

  abstract    = {We study idealised hydrodynamical simulations of Perseus-like galaxy cluster cores, with the goal of studying cooling flow regulation by jets generated by active galactic nuclei (AGN). The simulations are performed with the Eulerian code athena using high-resolution Godunov methods with low numerical diffusion. We use novel analysis methods to measure the cooling rate, the total heating rate, the heating rate from weak shocks and the heating rate from the decay of turbulent motions excited by the jet. We find that successful regulation of the cooling flow can be achieved with kinetic jets. Heating is anisotropic and is mostly distributed along the jet axis where the cooling flow is suppressed. Away from the jet axis the cooling flow is reduced by weak shock heating, but not fully suppressed. Turbulence is a significant source of heating only near the cluster centre, but this mechanism becomes inefficient at $\sim$50 kpc scales where it only represents a few % of the total heating rate and where most of the heating is provided by weak shocks. This qualitative picture is in agreement with previous numerical work. However, we find that several details of the simulations depend on the choice made for the hydro solver. This is a consequence of the difficulty of achieving proper numerical convergence for this problem: current physics implementations and resolutions do not properly capture multiphase gas that develops as a consequence of thermal instability. These processes happen at the grid scale and leave numerical solutions sensitive to the properties of the chosen hydro solver.},

  title       = {Gas accretion in Milky Way-like galaxies: temporal and radial dependencies},
  abstract    = {One of the fundamental assumptions of chemical evolution models (CEMs) of the Milky Way (MW) and other spirals is that higher gas accretion rates are expected in the past, and in the inner regions of the Galaxy. This leads to the so-called "inside-out disc formation scenario". Yet, these are probably the most unconstrained inputs of such models. In the present paper, we aim at investigating these main assumptions by studying how gas is accreted in four simulated MW-like galaxies assembled within the $\Lambda$CDM scenario. The galaxies were obtained using two different simulation techniques, cosmological setups and initial conditions. Two of them are MW candidates corresponding to the chemodynamical model of Minchev et al. (2013, 2014) (known as MCM) and the Local Group cosmological simulation of Nuza et al. (2014). We investigate vertical and radial gas accretion on to galaxy stellar discs as a function of cosmic time and disc radius. We find that accretion in the MW-like galaxies seem to happen in two distinct phases, namely: an early, more violent period; followed by a subsequent, slowly declining phase. Our simulations seem to give support to the assumption that the amount of gas incorporated into the MW disc exponentially decreases with time, leading to current net accretion rates of $0.3-1\,$M$_\odot\,$yr$^{-1}$. In particular, accretion timescales on to the simulated thin-disc-like structures are within $\sim5-7\,$Gyr, consistent with expectations from CEMs. Moreover, our simulated MW discs are assembled from the inside-out with gas in the inner disc regions accreted in shorter timescales than in external ones, in qualitative agreement with CEMs of the Galaxy. However, this type of growth is not general to all galaxies and it is intimately linked to their particular merger and gas accretion history.},

Active galactic nuclei feedback seems to play an important role on the determination of the stellar metallicity at high stellar masses.

In order to reproduce the overall redshift evolution we require the efficiency of converting gas into stars to decrease with decreasing redshift. Even for $z\ge 6$, our models require supernovae (SNe) feedback to reproduce the observed LF suggesting the prevalence of galactic winds that could have polluted the inter-galactic medium even at very high redshifts. The observed LF in the low luminosity end for $z<2.5$ shows an upward turn. In our models we reproduce this trend using passively evolving population of galaxies. Measuring stellar mass, age and metallicity of these galaxies using multi-band spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting will place strong constraints on the existence of such galaxies. While Active galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback is essential to reproduce the LF at high luminosity end for $z<4$, it may not needed in the case of $z\ge 6$. We show that the expected turn around in the LF due to cooling criteria occurs at luminosity much lower than what has been probed with present day observations. With future deep observations, that can measure the LF more accurately, we will be able to distinguish between different modes of SNe feedback and get insights into the physical processes that drive the galaxy evolution.},

By observing this 21-centimetre signal{\mdash}either its sky-averaged spectrum or maps of its fluctuations, obtained using radio interferometers{\mdash}we can obtain information about cosmic dawn, the era when the first astrophysical sources of light were formed. The recent detection of the global 21-centimetre spectrum reveals a stronger absorption than the maximum predicted by existing models, at a confidence level of 3.8 standard deviations. Here we report that this absorption can be explained by the combination of radiation from the first stars and excess cooling of the cosmic gas induced by its interaction with dark matter. Our analysis indicates that the spatial fluctuations of the 21-centimetre signal at cosmic dawn could be an order of magnitude larger than previously expected and that the dark-matter particle is no heavier than several proton masses, well below the commonly predicted mass of weakly interacting massive particles. Our analysis also confirms that dark matter is highly non-relativistic and at least moderately cold, and primordial velocities predicted by models of warm dark matter are potentially detectable.

  title       = {Cosmological simulations of black hole growth II: how (in)significant are merger events for fuelling nuclear activity?},
  abstract    = {Which mechanism(s) are mainly driving nuclear activity in the centres of galaxies is a major unsettled question. In this study, we investigate the statistical relevance of galaxy mergers for fuelling gas onto the central few kpc of a galaxy, potentially resulting in an active galactic nucleus (AGN). To robustly address that, we employ large-scale cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from the Magneticum Pathfinder set, adopting state-of-the-art models for BH accretion and AGN feedback. Our simulations predict that for luminous AGN ($L_{\rm AGN} > 10^{45} L_{\rm bol}$) at $z = 2$, more than 50 per cent of their host galaxies have experienced a merger in the last 0.5Gyr. These high merger fractions, however, merely reflect the intrinsically high merger rates of massive galaxies at $z=2$, in which luminous AGN preferentially occur. Apart from that, our simulation predictions disprove that merger events are the statistically dominant fuelling mechanism for nuclear activity over a redshift range $z=0-2$: irrespective of AGN luminosity, less than 20 per cent of AGN hosts have undergone a recent merger, in agreement with a number of observational studies. The central ISM conditions required for inducing AGN activity can be, but are not necessarily caused by a merger. Despite the statistically minor relevance of mergers, at a given AGN luminosity and stellar mass, the merger rates of AGN hosts can be by up to three times higher than that of inactive galaxies. Such elevated merger rates still point towards an intrinsic connection between AGN activity and mergers, consistent with our traditional expectation.},

  abstract      = {We investigate the variations in galaxy occupancy of the dark matter haloes with the large-scale environment and halo formation time, using two state-of-the-art hydrodynamical cosmological simulations, EAGLE and Illustris. For both simulations, we use three galaxy samples with a fixed number density ranked by stellar mass. For these samples we find that low-mass haloes in the most dense environments are more likely to host a central galaxy than those in the least dense environments. When splitting the halo population by formation time, these relations are stronger. Hence, at a fixed low halo mass, early-formed haloes are more likely to host a central galaxy than late-formed haloes since they have had more time to assemble. The satellite occupation shows a reverse trend where early-formed haloes host fewer satellites due to having more time to merge with the central galaxy. We also analyse the stellar mass -- halo mass relation for central galaxies in terms of the large-scale environment and formation time of the haloes. We find that low mass haloes in the most dense environment host relatively more massive central galaxies. This trend is also found when splitting the halo population by age, with early-formed haloes hosting more massive galaxies. Our results are in agreement with previous findings from semi-analytical models, providing robust predictions for the occupancy variation signature in the halo occupation distribution of galaxy formation models.},

Using the data from the catalogs, the size of the whole inhomogeneity in distribution of the galaxy cluster with the peak near z=0.56 is also estimated as about 6-8 degrees or 140-190 Mpc. A possibility of inhomogeneity (a galaxy cluster) near the GRB021004 direction can be also confirmed by an inhomogeneity in the cosmic microwave background related with the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect.},

In this Letter, we have measured the rest-frame NUV - B color gradients in {\tilde}1400 large (r $_{e}$ $\gt$ 0.{\Prime}18), nearly face-on (b/a $\gt$ 0.5) main sequence star-forming galaxies (SFGs) between redshift 0.5 and 1.5 in the CANDELS/GOODS-S and UDS fields. With this sample, we study the origin of UV-optical color gradients in the SFGs at z {\tilde} 1 and discuss their link with the buildup of stellar mass. We find that the more massive, centrally compact, and more dust extinguished SFGs tend to have statistically more negative raw color gradients (redder centers) than the less massive, centrally diffuse, and less dusty SFGs. After correcting for dust reddening based on optical-spectral energy distribution fitting, the color gradients in the low-mass (M $_{*}$ $\lt$ 10$^{10}$ M $_{⊙}$) SFGs generally become quite flat, while most of the high-mass (M $_{*}$ $\gt$ 10$^{10.5}$ M $_{⊙}$) SFGs still retain shallow negative color gradients. These findings imply that dust reddening is likely the principal cause of negative color gradients in the low-mass SFGs, while both increased central dust reddening and buildup of compact old bulges are likely the origins of negative color gradients in the high-mass SFGs. These findings also imply that at these redshifts the low-mass SFGs buildup their stellar masses in a self-similar way, while the high-mass SFGs grow inside out.},

  abstract      = {We extend the phenomenological study of the evolving galaxy population of Peng et al. (2010) to the central/satellite dichotomy in Yang et al. Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) groups. We find that satellite galaxies are responsible for all the environmental effects in our earlier work. The fraction of centrals that are red does not depend on their environment but only on their stellar masses, whereas that of the satellites depends on both. We define a relative satellite quenching efficiency {$\epsilon$}$_{sat}$, which is the fraction of blue centrals that are quenched upon becoming the satellite of another galaxy. This is shown to be independent of stellar mass, but to depend strongly on local overdensity, {$\delta$}, ranging between 0.2 and at least 0.8. The red fraction of satellites correlate much better with the local overdensity {$\delta$}, a measure of location within the group, than with the richness of the group, i.e., dark matter halo mass. This, and the fact that satellite quenching depends on local density and not on either the stellar mass of the galaxy or the dark matter halo mass, gives clues as to the nature of the satellite-quenching process. We furthermore show that the action of mass quenching on satellite galaxies is also independent of the dark matter mass of the parent halo. We then apply the Peng et al. approach to predict the mass functions of central and satellite galaxies, split into passive and active galaxies, and show that these match very well the observed mass functions from SDSS, further strengthening the validity of this phenomenological approach. We highlight the fact that the observed M* is exactly the same for the star-forming centrals and satellites and the observed M* for the star-forming satellites is independent of halo mass above 10$^{12}$ M $_{⊙}$, which emphasizes the universality of the mass-quenching process that we identified in Peng et al. Post-quenching merging modifies the mass function of the central galaxies but can increase the mass of typical centrals by only about 25\%.},

Our sample is based on the NASA-Sloan Atlas which is a reanalysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 8. We examine the relative number of quenched versus star-forming dwarf galaxies, defining quenched galaxies as having no H{$\alpha$} emission (EW$_{Hα}$ $\lt$ 2 {\AA}) and a strong 4000 {\AA} break. The fraction of quenched dwarf galaxies decreases rapidly with increasing distance from a massive host, leveling off for distances beyond 1.5 Mpc. We define galaxies beyond 1.5 Mpc of a massive host galaxy to be in the field. We demonstrate that there is a stellar mass threshold of M $_{stellar}$ $\lt$ 1.0 {\times} 10$^{9}$ M $_{⊙}$ below which quenched galaxies do not exist in the field. Below this threshold, we find that none of the 2951 field dwarf galaxies are quenched; all field dwarf galaxies show evidence for recent star formation. Correcting for volume effects, this corresponds to a 1{$\sigma$} upper limit on the quenched fraction of 0.06\%. In more dense environments, quenched galaxies account for 23\% of the dwarf population over the same stellar mass range. The majority of quenched dwarf galaxies (often classified as dwarf elliptical galaxies) are within 2 virial radii of a massive galaxy, and only a few percent of quenched dwarf galaxies exist beyond 4 virial radii. Thus, for galaxies with stellar mass less than 1.0 {\times} 10$^{9}$ M $_{⊙}$, ending star formation requires the presence of a more massive neighbor, providing a stringent constraint on models of star formation feedback.},

We combine imaging from three deep near-infrared-selected surveys (ZFOURGE/CANDELS, Ultra Deep Survey, and UltraVISTA), which allows us to select a stellar-mass complete sample of satellites with $\mathrm{log}({M}_{\mathrm{sat}}/{M}_{\odot })\gt 9.3$. Satellites for both star-forming and quiescent central galaxies ("centrals") have higher quiescent fractions compared to field galaxies matched in stellar mass at all redshifts. We also observe "galactic conformity": satellites around quiescent centrals are more likely to be quenched compared to the satellites around star-forming centrals. In our sample, this conformity signal is significant at $\gtrsim 3\sigma $ for $0.6\lt z\lt 1.6$, whereas it is only weakly significant at $0.3\lt z\lt 0.6$ and $1.6\lt z\lt 2.5$. Therefore, conformity (and thus satellite quenching) has been present for a significant fraction of the age of the universe. The satellite quenching efficiency increases with increasing stellar mass of the central, but does not appear to depend on the stellar mass of the satellite to the mass limit of our sample. When we compare the satellite quenching efficiency of star-forming centrals with stellar masses 0.2 dex higher than quiescent centrals (which should account for any difference in halo mass), the conformity signal decreases, but remains statistically significant at $0.6\lt z\lt 0.9$. This is evidence that satellite quenching is connected to the star formation properties of the central galaxy as well as to the mass of the halo. We discuss physical effects that may contribute to galactic conformity, and emphasize that they must allow for continued star formation in the central galaxy even as the satellites are quenched.},

For 2905 field galaxies, complete to 10$^{10}$(10$^{10.8}$) M$_{solar}$ at z$\lt$0.7(1), with Keck spectroscopic redshifts out to z=1.1, we compile SF rates (SFRs) from emission lines, GALEX, and Spitzer MIPS 24 {$\mu$}m photometry, optical-NIR M$_{*}$ measurements, and HST morphologies. Galaxies with reliable signs of SF form a distinct ``main sequence'' (MS), with a limited range of SFRs at a given M$_{*}$ and z (1 {$\sigma$}$\lt$\~{}+/-0.3 dex), and log(SFR) approximately proportional to logM$_{*}$. The range of log(SFR) remains constant to z$\gt$1, while the MS as a whole moves to higher SFR as z increases. The range of the SFR along the MS constrains the amplitude of episodic variations of SF and the effect of mergers on the SFR. Typical galaxies spend \~{}67\%(95\%) of their lifetime since z=1 within a factor of $\lt$\~{}2(4) of their average SFR at a given M$_{*}$ and z. The dominant mode of the evolution of SF since z\~{}1 is apparently a gradual decline of the average SFR in most individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of starburst episodes, or a decreasing factor by which SFRs are enhanced in starbursts. LIRGs at z\~{}1 seem to mostly reflect the high SFR typical for massive galaxies at that epoch. The smooth MS may reflect that the same set of few physical processes governs SF prior to additional quenching processes. A gradual process like gas exhaustion may play a dominant role.},

We therefore rule out simple models in which bulges were fully assembled at high redshift and disks gradually formed around them. Instead, bulges (and black holes) likely formed in lockstep with disks, through bar instabilities, migration, or other processes. We find that after z = 1 the growth in the central regions gradually stopped and the disk continued to be built up, consistent with recent studies of the gas distributions in z \~{} 1 galaxies and the properties of many spiral galaxies today.},

We identify 5 pairs and 1 triplet, enclosing a total of 13 galaxies, based on limits on projected separation and line-of-sight velocity difference. Of these systems, none show signs of ongoing interaction, and therefore we do not find any true mergers in our sample. This negative result sets a 1{$\sigma$} upper limit of 1.5\% per Gyr for the major dry merger rate, consistent with the low rates expected in present-day clusters. Detailed examination of the images of all the RS galaxies in the sample reveals only one with low surface brightness features identifiable as the remnant of a past merger or interaction, implying a post-merger fraction below 2\%.},

Even within the star-forming `main sequence', the measured sSFR decreases with stellar mass, both in an integrated and spatially-resolved sense. Flat sSFR radial profiles are observed for $\rm log(M\_\star/ M\_\odot) \lt 10.5$, while star-forming galaxies of higher mass show a significant decrease in sSFR in the central regions, a likely consequence of both larger bulges and an inside-out growth history. Our primary focus is the green valley, constituted by galaxies lying below the star formation main sequence, but not fully passive. In the green valley we find sSFR profiles that are suppressed with respect to star-forming galaxies of the same mass at all galactocentric distances out to 2 effective radii. The responsible quenching mechanism therefore appears to affect the entire galaxy, not simply an expanding central region. The majority of green valley galaxies of $\rm log(M\_\star/ M\_\odot) \gt 10.0$ are classified spectroscopically as central low-ionisation emission-line regions (cLIERs). Despite displaying a higher central stellar mass concentration, the sSFR suppression observed in cLIER galaxies is not simply due to the larger mass of the bulge. Drawing a comparison sample of star forming galaxies with the same $\rm M\_\star$ and $\rm \Sigma\_{1~kpc}$ (the mass surface density within 1 kpc), we show that a high $\rm \Sigma\_{1~kpc}$ is not a sufficient condition for determining central quiescence.},

These results, derived using the STARLIGHT code, are compared with a control sample of non-active galaxies matching the properties of the AGN hosts. We find that the fraction of young stellar populations (SP) in high-luminosity AGN is higher in the inner ($R \leq 0.5\,R_e$) regions when compared with the control sample; low-luminosity AGN, on the other hand, present very similar fractions of young stars to the control sample hosts for the entire studied range ($1\,R_e$). The fraction of intermediate age SP of the AGN hosts increases outwards, with a clear enhancement when compared with the control sample. The inner region of the galaxies (AGN and control galaxies) presents a dominant old SP, whose fraction decreases outwards. We also compare our results (differences between AGN and control galaxies) for the early and late-type hosts and find no significant differences. In summary, our results suggest that the most luminous AGN seems to have been triggered by a recent supply of gas that has also triggered recent star formation ($t\,\leq\,40\,Myrs$) in the central region.},

  abstract    = {We investigate the global neutral hydrogen (HI) content of isolated galaxies selected from the SDSS spectroscopic survey with optical evidence of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Our sample includes galaxies with unresolved HI observations from the ALFALFA 70% data release combined with deeper HI observations of low-mass galaxies with 7.0 < log(M*) < 9.5. We examine the HI masses of this sample using the distance from the star-forming sequence on the OIII\Hb and NII\Ha Baldwin Phillips Terlevich (BPT) diagram as a measurement of AGN activity. In agreement with previous studies, we find that, for galaxies with log(M*) > 9.5, AGN activity does not correlate with the global HI content. However, for galaxies with 9.2 < log(M*) < 9.5, we identify a set of objects at large distances from the BPT star-forming sequence and lower than expected HI masses. This gas-depleted sample is red in both g-r and NUV-r colors and compact without distinguishable signs of star formation. This is surprising because the vast majority of isolated galaxies in this stellar mass regime are both star-forming and gas-rich. These galaxies are greater than 1.5 Mpc from any massive galaxy, ruling out environmental processes as a source of the gas-depletion. We suggest that either black hole feedback or shocks from extremely bursty star formation cause the emission lines and have destroyed or otherwise consumed the cold gas.},

A method based on the density field and the Hoshen-Kopelman algorithm is developed to identify filaments. We show that cold and dense gas preprocessed by dark matter filaments can be further accreted into residing individual low-mass haloes in directions along the filaments. Consequently, comparing with field haloes, gas accretion is very anisotropic for filament haloes. About 30-40 percent of the accreted gas of a residing filament halo was preprocessed by filaments, leading to two different thermal histories for the gas in filament haloes. Filament haloes have higher baryon and stellar fractions when comparing with their field counterparts. Our results suggest that filaments assist gas cooling and enhance star formation in their residing dark matter haloes.},

We consider the chemical evolution models for the Galactic disc developed by Grisoni et al. (2017) for the solar neighborhood, both the two-infall and the one-infall, and we extend our analysis to the other Galactocentric distances. In particular, we examine the processes which mainly influence the formation of abundance gradients: i) the inside-out scenario for the formation of the Galactic thin disc, ii) a variable star formation efficiency, and iii) radial gas flows. We compare our model results with recent abundance patterns along the Galactic disc from APOGEE survey and with abundance gradients observed from Cepheids, open clusters, HII regions and PNe. We conclude that the inside-out scenario is a key ingredient, but cannot be the only one to explain abundance patterns at different Galactocentric distances and abundance gradients. Further ingredients, such as radial gas flows and variable star formation efficiency, are needed to reproduce the observed features in the thin disc. In particular, the model with a variable star formation efficiency is in very good agreement with the observational data, both the abundance patterns at different Galactocentric distances and abundance gradients. The model with variable star formation efficiency predicts a flattening of the gradient with time, which is in agreement with other chemical evolution models and cosmological simulations, but it does not allow the inversion of gradients, observed at high redshift.},

PSB galaxies have a quite precise life-time ($\lt$ 1 - 1.5Gyr), and they hold important clues for understanding galaxy evolution. While the properties (stellar mass, absolute magnitude, color) of PSBs do not depend on environment, their frequency increases going from single galaxies to binary systems to groups, both considering the incidence with respect to the global number of galaxies and to the number of currently+recently star-forming galaxies. Including in our analysis the sample of cluster PSBs drawn from the WIde-field Nearby Galaxy-cluster Survey presented in Paccagnella et al. , we extend the halo mass range covered and present a coherent picture of the effect of the environment on galaxy transformations. We find that the PSB/(PSB+EML) fraction steadily increases with halo mass going from 1\% in 10\^{}11Msun haloes to \~{}15\% in the most massive haloes (10\^{}15.5Msun). Our analysis does not allow us to definitely identify the main mechanisms responsible for the appearance of the PSB spectrum. However, the higher incidence of PSB galaxies in the densest environments suggests that the processes operating in the most massive haloes, such as ram pressure stripping, are more effective in producing such population than the processes operating in the sparsest environments, most likely galaxy interactions.},

Approximating intrinsic shapes of the galaxies as triaxial ellipsoids and assuming a multivariate normal distribution of galaxy size and two shape parameters, we construct their intrinsic shape and size distributions to obtain the fractions of prolate, oblate and spheroidal galaxies in each redshift and mass bin. We find that galaxies tend to be prolate at low m and high redshifts, and oblate at high M and low redshifts, qualitatively consistent with van der Wel et al. (2014), implying that galaxies tend to evolve from prolate to oblate. These results are consistent with the predictions from simulations (Ceverino et al. 2015, Tomassetti et al. 2016) that the transition from prolate to oblate is caused by a compaction event at a characteristic mass range, making the galaxy center baryon dominated. We give probabilities of a galaxy's being prolate, oblate or spheroidal as a function of its M, redshift, projected b/a and a, which can facilitate target selections of galaxies with specific shapes at hight redshifts. We also give predicted optical depths of galaxies, which are qualitatively consistent with the expected correlation that AV should be higher for edge-on disk galaxies in each log a slice at low redshift and high mass bins.},

  abstract      = {High Mach number shocks are ubiquitous in interstellar turbulence. The Pencil Code is particularly well suited to the study of magnetohydrodynamics in weakly compressible turbulence and the numerical investigation of dynamos because of its high-order advection and time evolution algorithms. However, the high-order algorithms and lack of Riemann solver to follow shocks make it less well suited to handling high Mach number shocks, such as those produced by supernovae (SNe). Here, we outline methods required to enable the code to efficiently and accurately model SNe, using parameters that allow stable simulation of SN-driven turbulence, in order to construct a physically realistic galactic dynamo model. These include the resolution of shocks with artificial viscosity, thermal conductivity, and mass diffusion; the correction of the mass diffusion terms; and generalization of the Courant condition to include all source terms in the momentum and energy equations. We test our methods with the numerical solution of the 1D Riemann shock tube (Sod 1978), also extended to a 1D adiabatic shock with parameters and Mach number relevant to SN shock evolution, including shocks with radiative losses. We extend our test with the 3D numerical simulation of individual SN remnant evolution for a range of ambient gas densities typical of the interstellar medium and relate these to the analytical solutions of Sedov-Taylor (adiabatic) and the snowplough and Cioffi et al.

  abstract      = {Infrared interferometry of Seyfert galaxies has revealed that their warm ($300-400\,$K) dust emission originates primarily from polar regions instead of from an equatorial dust torus as predicted by the classic AGN unification scheme. We present new data for the type 1.2 object ESO$\,$323-G77 obtained with the MID-infrared interferometric Instrument (MIDI) and a new detailed morphological study of its warm dust. The partially resolved emission on scales between $5$ and $50\,$mas ($1.6-16\,$pc) is decomposed into a resolved and an unresolved source. Approximately $65\\%$ of the correlated flux between $8$ and $13\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ is unresolved at all available baseline lengths. The remaining $35\\%$ is partially resolved and shows angular structure. From geometric modelling we find that the emission is elongated along a position angle of $155^\circ\pm14^\circ$ with an axis ratio (major/minor) of $2.9\pm0.3$. Because the system axis is oriented in position angle $174^\circ\pm2^\circ$, we conclude that the dust emission of this object is also polar extended. A $\textit{CAT3D-WIND}$ radiative transfer model of a dusty disk and a dusty wind with a half opening angle of $30^\circ$ can reproduce both the interferometric data and the SED, while a classical torus model is unable to fit the interferometric data. We interpret this as further evidence that a polar dust component is required even for low-inclination type 1 sources.},

  abstract    = {Galaxy mass and environment play a major role in the evolution of galaxies. In the transition from star-forming to quenched galaxies, Active galactic nuclei (AGN) have also a principal action. However, the connections between these three actors are still uncertain. In this work we investigate the effects of stellar mass and the large-scale environment (LSS), on the fraction of optical nuclear activity in a population of isolated galaxies, where AGN would not be triggered by recent galaxy interactions or mergers. As a continuation of a previous work, we focus on isolated galaxies to study the effect of stellar mass and the LSS in terms of morphology (early- and late-type), colour (red and blue), and specific star formation rate (quenched and star-forming). To explore where AGN activity is affected by the LSS we fix the stellar mass into low- and high-mass galaxies. We use the tidal strength parameter to quantify their effects. We found that AGN is strongly affected by stellar mass in 'active' galaxies (namely late-type, blue, and star-forming), however it has no influence for 'quiescent' galaxies (namely early-type, red, and quenched), at least for masses down to $\rm 10^{10}\,[M_\odot]$. In relation to the LSS, we found an increment on the fraction of SFN with denser LSS in low-mass star forming and red isolated galaxies. Regarding AGN, we find a clear increment of the fraction of AGN with denser environment in quenched and red isolated galaxies, independently of the stellar mass. AGN activity would be 'mass triggered' in 'active' isolated galaxies. This means that AGN is independent of the intrinsic property of the galaxies, but on its stellar mass. On the other hand, AGN would be 'environment triggered' in 'quiescent' isolated galaxies, where the fraction of AGN in terms of sSFR and colour increases from void regions to denser LSS, independently of its stellar mass.},

  abstract    = {The formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies in low-density environments is less clear compared to classical elliptical galaxies in high-density environments. Isolated galaxies are defined as galaxies without massive neighbors within scales of galaxy groups. The impact of environment at several Mpc scales on the their properties has been barely explored. Here we study the role of large-scale environment in 573 isolated elliptical galaxies out to z=0.08. The aim is to explore whether the large-scale environment affects some of their physical properties. We use three environmental estimators of the large-scale structure within a projected radius of 5 Mpc around isolated galaxies: the tidal strength parameter, the projected density eta_k, and the distance to the fifth nearest neighbor galaxy. We find that 80% of galaxies at lower densities correspond to 'red and dead' elliptical galaxies. Blue and red galaxies do not tend to be located in different environments according to eta_k. Almost all the isolated ellipticals in the densest large-scale environments are red and/or quenched, where a third of them are low-mass galaxies. We have identified 33 blue, star-forming isolated ellipticals, which are in low density environments. A half of them are star-forming nuclei, whereas 92% of the isolated ellipticals with emission lines corresponds to AGN or composite objects. The large-scale environment is not playing the main role to determine the color and sSFR of isolated elliptical galaxies. The large-scale environment seems to be negligible from a stellar mass scale around 10^10.6 Msun, probably due to the dominant presence of AGN at larger masses. For lower masses, the processes of cooling and infall of gas from large scales are very inefficient in ellipticals. AGN might be also an important ingredient to keep most of the low-mass isolated elliptical galaxies quenched.},

  abstract      = {Using a representative sample of 911 central galaxies (CENs) from the SDSS DR4 group catalogue, we study how the structure of the most massive members in groups and clusters depend on (1) galaxy stellar mass (Mstar), (2) dark matter halo mass of the host group (Mhalo), and (3) their halo-centric position. We establish and thoroughly test a GALFIT-based pipeline to fit 2D Sersic models to SDSS data. We find that the fitting results are most sensitive to the background sky level determination and strongly recommend using the SDSS global value. We find that uncertainties in the background translate into a strong covariance between the total magnitude, half-light size (r50), and Sersic index (n), especially for bright/massive galaxies. We find that n depends strongly on Mstar for CENs, but only weakly or not at all on Mhalo. Less (more) massive CENs tend to be disk (spheroid)-like over the full Mhalo range. Likewise, there is a clear r50-Mstar relation for CENs, with separate slopes for disks and spheroids. When comparing CENs with satellite galaxies (SATs), we find that low mass ($\lt$10e10.75 Msun/h\^{}2) SATs have larger median n than CENs of similar Mstar. Low mass, late-type SATs have moderately smaller r50 than late-type CENs of the same Mstar. However, we find no size differences between spheroid-like CENs and SATs, and no structural differences between CENs and SATs matched in both mass and colour. The similarity of massive SATs and CENs shows that this distinction has no significant impact on the structure of spheroids. We conclude that Mstar is the most fundamental property determining the basic structure of a galaxy. The lack of a clear n-Mhalo relation rules out a distinct group mass for producing spheroids, and the responsible morphological transformation processes must occur at the centres of groups spanning a wide range of masses.

The large SDSS data base provides statistics of unprecedented accuracy. For each type of galaxy, the size distribution at given luminosity (or stellar mass) is well described by a log-normal function, characterized by its median and dispersion {$\sigma$}$_{lnR}$. For late-type galaxies, there is a characteristic luminosity at M$_{r,0}$\~{}-20.5 (assuming h= 0.7) corresponding to a stellar mass M$_{0}$\~{} 10$^{10.6}$ M$_{solar}$. Galaxies more massive than M$_{0}$ have and {$\sigma$}$_{lnR}$\~{} 0.3, while less massive galaxies have and {$\sigma$}$_{lnR}$\~{} 0.5. For early-type galaxies, the relation is significantly steeper, , but the {$\sigma$}$_{lnR}$-M relation is similar to that of bright late-type galaxies. Faint red galaxies have sizes quite independent of their luminosities. We use simple theoretical models to interpret these results. The observed relation for late-type galaxies can be explained if the fraction of baryons that form stars is as predicted by the standard feedback model. Fitting the observed {$\sigma$}$_{lnR}$-M relation requires in addition that the bulge/disc mass ratio be larger in haloes of lower angular momentum and that the bulge material transfers part of its angular momentum to the disc. This can be achieved if bulge formation occurs so as to maintain a marginally stable disc. For early-type galaxies, the observed {$\sigma$}$_{lnR}$-M relation is inconsistent with formation through single major mergers of present-day discs. It is consistent with formation through repeated mergers, if the progenitors have properties similar to those of faint ellipticals or Lyman break galaxies and merge from relatively strongly bound orbits.},

  abstract      = {Understanding the evolution of carbon and iron in the Milky Way's halo is of importance because these two elements play crucial roles constraining star formation, Galactic assembly, and chemical evolution in the early Universe. Here, we explore the spatial distributions of carbonicity, [C/Fe], and metallicity, [Fe/H], of the halo system based on medium-resolution ($R \sim$ 1,300) spectroscopy of $\sim$58,000 stars in the Southern Hemisphere from the AAOmega Evolution of Galactic Structure (AEGIS) survey. The AEGIS carbonicity map exhibits a positive gradient with distance, as similarly found for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) carbonicity map of Lee et al. The metallicity map confirms that [Fe/H] decreases with distance, from the inner halo to the outer halo. We also explore the formation and chemical-evolution history of the halo by considering the populations of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars present in the AEGIS sample. The cumulative and differential frequencies of CEMP-no stars (as classified by their characteristically lower levels of absolute carbon abundance, $A$(C) $\leq$ 7.1 for sub-giants and giants) increases with decreasing metallicity, and is $\backslash$textit$\{$substantially higher than previous determinations$\}$ for CEMP stars as a whole. In contrast, that of CEMP-$s$ stars (with higher $A$(C)), remains almost flat, at a value $\sim$10$\backslash$\%, in the range $-\,4.0 \lesssim$ [Fe/H] $\lesssim-$2.0. The distinctly different behaviors of the CEMP-no and CEMP-$s$ stars relieve the tension with population-synthesis models assuming a binary mass-transfer origin, which previously struggled to account for the higher reported frequencies of CEMP stars, taken as a whole, at low metallicity.},

We provide a catalog of cluster galaxies that lists magnitudes, redshifts, morphologies, bulge-to-total ratios, and local density. Based on the 1409 spectroscopically-confirmed cluster galaxies brighter than -19.8 in the r-band, we study galaxy morphology, color, and visual features generated by galaxy mergers. We see a clear trend between morphological content and cluster velocity dispersion, which was not presented by previous studies using local clusters. Passive spirals are preferentially found in a highly dense region (i.e., cluster center), indicating that they have gone through the environmental quenching. In deep images (mu\_r \~{} 27 mag/``\^{}2), 20\% of our sample show signatures of recent mergers, which is not expected from theoretical predictions and a low frequency of ongoing mergers in our sample (\~{} 4\%). Such a high fraction of recent mergers in the cluster environment supports a scenario that the merger events that made the features have preceded the galaxy accretion into the cluster environment. We conclude that mergers affect a cluster population mainly through the pre-processing on recently accreted galaxies.},

Based on the average size versus stellar-mass relation in each redshift bin, we divide our galaxies into Small SFGs (SSFGs), i.e., smaller than average for its mass, and Large SFGs (LSFGs), i.e., larger than average. We find that, at low masses ($M\_{\ast} \lt 10^{10}M\_{\odot}$), the SSFGs generally have nearly flat $\varepsilon$ and A$\_4$ profiles for both edge-on and face-on views, especially at redshifts $z\gt1$. Moreover, the median A$\_4$ values at all radii are almost zero. In contrast, the highly-inclined, low-mass LSFGs in the same mass-redshift bins generally have monotonically increasing $\varepsilon$ with radius and are dominated by disky values at intermediate radii. These findings at intermediate redshifts imply that low-mass SSFGs are not disk-like, while low-mass LSFGs appear to harbour disk-like components flattened by significant rotation. At high masses ($M\_{\ast} \gt 10^{10}M\_{\odot}$), highly-inclined SSFGs and LSFGs both exhibit a general, distinct trend for both $\varepsilon$ and A$\_4$ profiles: increasing values with radius at lower radii, reaching maxima at intermediate radii, and then decreasing values at larger radii. Such a trend is more prevalent for more massive ($M\_{\ast} \gt 10^{10.5}M\_{\odot}$) galaxies or those at lower redshifts ($z\lt1.4$). The distinct trend in $\varepsilon$ and A$\_4$ can be simply explained if galaxies possess all three components: central bulges, disks in the intermediate regions, and halo-like stellar components in the outskirts.},

  abstract      = {Post-starbursts are galaxies in transition from the blue cloud to the red sequence. Although they are rare today, integrated over time they may be an important pathway to the red sequence. This work uses SDSS, GALEX, and WISE observations to identify the evolutionary sequence from starbursts to fully quenched post-starbursts in the narrow mass range $\log M(M\_\odot) = 10.3-10.7$, and identifies ``transiting'' post-starbursts which are intermediate between these two populations. In this mass range, $\sim 0.3\\%$ of galaxies are starbursts, $\sim 0.1\\%$ are quenched post-starbursts, and $\sim 0.5\\%$ are the transiting types in between. The transiting post-starbursts have stellar properties that are predicted for fast-quenching starbursts and morphological characteristics that are already typical of early-type galaxies. The AGN fraction, as estimated from optical line ratios, of these post-starbursts is about 3 times higher ($\gtrsim 36 \pm 8 \\%$) than that of normal star-forming galaxies of the same mass, but there is a significant delay between the starburst phase and the peak of nuclear optical AGN activity (median age difference of $\gtrsim 200 \pm 100$ Myr), in agreement with previous studies. The time delay is inferred by comparing the broad-band near NUV-to-optical photometry with stellar population synthesis models. We also find that starbursts and post-starbursts are significantly more dust-obscured than normal star-forming galaxies in the same mass range. About $20\\%$ of the starbursts and $15\\%$ of the transiting post-starbursts can be classified as the ``Dust-Obscured Galaxies'' (DOGs), while only $0.8\\%$ of normal galaxies are DOGs.The time delay between the starburst phase and AGN activity suggests that AGN do not play a primary role in the original quenching of starbursts but may be responsible for quenching later low-level star formation during the post-starburst phase.},

GALEX UV data are used to cleanly divide the sample into star-forming and quenched galaxies, and to identify galaxies in transition (the green valley). Despite a stark difference in visual appearance between blue and red galaxies, their average radial stellar mass density profiles are remarkably similar (especially in the outer regions) at fixed mass. The inner stellar mass surface density within a radius of 1 kpc, $\backslash$Sigma\_1, is used to quantify the growth of the bulge as galaxies evolve. When galaxies are divided into narrow mass bins, their distribution in the color-$\backslash$Sigma\_1 plane at fixed mass forms plausible evolutionary tracks. $\backslash$Sigma\_1 seems to grow as galaxies evolve through the blue cloud, and once it crosses a threshold value, galaxies are seen to quench at fixed $\backslash$Sigma\_1. The $\backslash$Sigma\_1 threshold for quenching grows with stellar mass, $\backslash$Sigma\_1 \~{} M\_*\^{}$\{$0.64$\}$. However, the existence of some star-forming galaxies above the threshold $\backslash$Sigma\_1 implies that a dense bulge is necessary but not sufficient to quench a galaxy fully. This would be consistent with a two-step quenching process in which gas within a galaxy is removed or stabilized against star formation by bulge-driven processes (such as a starburst, AGN feedback, or morphological quenching), whereas external gas accretion is suppressed by separate halo-driven processes (such as halo gas shock heating). Quenching thus depends on an interplay between the inner structure of a galaxy and its surrounding dark matter halo, and lack of perfect synchrony between the two could produce the observed scatter in color vs. $\backslash$Sigma\_1.

Broad-line AGNs are distributed throughout the blue cloud and green valley at a given stellar mass, and are much rarer in quiescent (red sequence) galaxies. This is in contrast to the published host galaxy properties of weaker narrow-line AGNs, indicating that broad-line AGNs occur during a different phase in galaxy evolution. More luminous broad-line AGNs have bluer host galaxies, even at fixed mass, suggesting that the same processes that fuel nuclear activity also efficiently form stars. The data favor processes that simultaneously fuel both star formation activity and rapid supermassive black hole accretion. If AGNs cause feedback on their host galaxies in the nearby universe, the evidence of galaxy-wide quenching must be delayed until after the broad-line AGN phase.},

  abstract      = {The shutdown of star formation in galaxies is generally termed `quenching'. Although quenching may occur through a variety of processes, the exact mechanism(s) that is in fact responsible for quenching is still in question. This paper addresses quenching by searching for traces of possible quenching processes through their effects on galaxy structural parameters such as surface stellar mass density and Sersic index (n). We analyze the rest-frame U-B color correlations versus these structural parameters using a sample of galaxies in the redshift range 0.5$\lt$ z$\lt$0.8 from the DEEP2/AEGIS survey. We find that Sersic index (n) has the smallest overlap region among all tested parameters and resembles a step-function with a threshold value of n=2.3. There exists, however, a significant population of outliers with blue colors yet high n values that seem to contradict this behavior. We hypothesize that their Sersic values may be distorted by bursts of star formation, AGNs, and/or poor fits, leading us to consider central surface stellar mass density as an alternative to Sersic index. Not only does it correct the outliers, it also forms a tight relationship with color, suggesting that the innermost structure of galaxies is most physically linked with quenching. Furthermore, at z\~{}0.65, the majority of the blue cloud galaxies cannot simply fade onto the red sequence since their GIM2D bulge masses are only half as large on average as the bulge masses of similar red sequence galaxies, thus demonstrating that stellar mass must absolutely increase at the centers of galaxies as they quench. We discuss a two-stage model for quenching in which galaxy star formation rates are controlled by their dark halos while they are still in the blue cloud and a second quenching process sets in later, associated with the central stellar mass build-up.},

A sample is drawn from bulge-dominated GALEX/SDSS galaxies on the optical red sequence with strong UV excess and yet quiescent SDSS spectra. High-resolution far-UV imaging of 27 such ETGs using HST ACS/SBC reveals structured UV morphology in 93\% of the sample, consistent with low-level ongoing SF (\~{}0.5 Ms/yr). In 3/4 of the sample the SF is extended on galaxy scales (25-75 kpc), while the rest contains smaller (5-15 kpc) SF patches in the vicinity of an ETG - presumably gas-rich satellites being disrupted. Optical imaging reveals that all ETGs with galaxy-scale SF in our sample have old stellar disks (mostly S0 type). None is classified as a true elliptical. In our sample, galaxy-scale SF takes the form of UV rings of varying sizes and morphologies. For the majority of such objects we conclude that the gas needed to fuel current SF has been accreted from the IGM, probably in a prolonged, quasi-static manner, leading in some cases to additional disk buildup. The remaining ETGs with galaxy-scale SF have UV and optical morphologies consistent with minor merger-driven SF or with the final stages of SF in fading spirals. Our analysis excludes that all recent SF on the red sequence resulted from gas-rich mergers. We find further evidence that galaxy-scale SF is almost exclusively an S0 phenomenon (\~{}20\% S0s have SF) by examining the overall optically red SDSS ETGs. Conclusion is that significant number of field S0s maintain or resume low-level SF because the preventive feedback is not in place or is intermittent. True ellipticals, on the other hand, stay entirely quiescent even in the field.},

  abstract      = {The removal of gas by ram pressure stripping of galaxies is treated by a purely kinematic description. The solution has two asymptotic limits: if the duration of the ram pressure pulse exceeds the period of vertical oscillations perpendicular to the galactic plane, the commonly used quasi-static criterion of Gunn {\amp} Gott is obtained which uses the maximum ram pressure that the galaxy has experienced along its orbit. For shorter pulses the outcome depends on the time-integrated ram pressure. This parameter pair fully describes the gas mass fraction that is stripped from a given galaxy. This approach closely reproduces results from SPH simulations. We show that typical galaxies follow a very tight relation in this parameter space corresponding to a pressure pulse length of about 300 Myr. Thus, the Gunn {\amp} Gott criterion provides a good description for galaxies in larger clusters. Applying the analytic description to a sample of 232 Virgo galaxies from the GoldMine database, we show that the ICM provides indeed the ram pressures needed to explain the deficiencies. We also can distinguish current and past strippers, including objects whose stripping state was unknown.},

We achieve this goal by combining photometric information from SDSS, UKIDSS, and WISE surveys as well as complementing with a stacking analysis of Herschel, AKARI, and Planck maps at the location of the QSOs. The near-UV and optical parts of the reconstructed mean rest-frame SED are similar to those found in other studies. However, the SED shows an excess at 1-2 $\mu$m (when compared to the aforementioned SEDs normalized in the near-UV) and a prominent bump around 4-6 $\mu$m, followed by a decrease out to $\sim 20 \,\mu$m and a subsequent far-IR bump. We perform SED fitting to the composite SEDs in order to estimate the average active galactic nuclei (AGN) luminosity $L\_{\rm AGN}$ and star formation rate (SFR) as function of cosmic time, finding typical $L\_{\rm AGN} \sim 10^{46} - 10^{47}$ erg/s and SFR $\sim 50 - 1000\, M\_{\odot}/$yr. We develop mid-IR based criteria to split the QSO sample, finding that these allow us to move along the average relationship in the $L\_{\rm AGN}-$SFR plane toward increasing luminosities. We also find the detection in the far-IR band to be an effective criterion to select objects where the star formation is on the verge of being quenched by AGN activity.},

  abstract      = {We use the photon flux and absorption tracer algorithm presented in Katz et al. 2018, to characterise the contribution of haloes of different mass and stars of different age and metallicity to the reionization of the Universe. We employ a suite of cosmological multifrequency radiation hydrodynamics AMR simulations that are carefully calibrated to reproduce a realistic reionization history and galaxy properties at $z \geq 6$. In our simulations, haloes with mass $10^9{\rm M\_{\odot}}h^{-1}\ltM\lt10^{10}{\rm M\_{\odot}}h^{-1}$, stars with metallicity $10^{-3}Z\_{\odot}\ltZ\lt10^{-1.5}Z\_{\odot}$, and stars with age $3\,{\rm Myr} \lt t \lt 10 \, {\rm Myr}$ dominate reionization by both mass and volume. We show that the sources that reionize most of the volume of the Universe by $z=6$ are not necessarily the same sources that dominate the meta-galactic UV background at the same redshift. We further show that in our simulations, the contribution of each type of source to reionization is not uniform across different gas phases. The IGM, CGM, filaments, ISM, and rarefied supernova heated gas have all been photoionized by different classes of sources. Collisional ionisation contributes at both the lowest and highest densities. In the early stages of the formation of individual HII bubbles, reionization proceeds with the formation of concentric shells of gas ionised by different classes of sources, leading to large temperature variations as a function of galacto-centric radius. The temperature structure of individual HII bubbles may thus give insight into the star formation history of the galaxies acting as the first ionising sources. Our explorative simulations highlight how the complex nature of reionization can be better understood by using our photon tracer algorithm.},

  abstract      = {We develop a model for the cosmological role of mergers in the evolution of starbursts, quasars, and spheroidal galaxies. By combining theoretically well-constrained halo and subhalo mass functions as a function of redshift and environment with empirical halo occupation models, we can estimate where galaxies of given properties live at a particular epoch. This allows us to calculate, in an a priori cosmological manner, where major galaxy-galaxy mergers occur and what kinds of galaxies merge, at all redshifts. We compare this with the observed mass functions, clustering, fractions as a function of halo and galaxy mass, and small-scale environments of mergers, and we show that this approach yields robust estimates in good agreement with observations and can be extended to predict detailed properties of mergers. Making the simple Ansatz that major, gas-rich mergers cause quasar activity (but not strictly assuming they are the only triggering mechanism), we demonstrate that this model naturally reproduces the observed rise and fall of the quasar luminosity density at z = 0-6, as well as quasar luminosity functions, fractions, host galaxy colors, and clustering as a function of redshift and luminosity. The recent observed excess of quasar clustering on small scales at z \~{} 0.2-2.5 is a natural prediction of our model, as mergers will preferentially occur in regions with excess small-scale galaxy overdensities. In fact, we demonstrate that quasar environments at all observed redshifts correspond closely to the empirically determined small group scale, where major mergers of \~{}L$_{*}$ gas-rich galaxies will be most efficient. We contrast this with a secular model in which quasar activity is driven by bars or other disk instabilities, and we show that, while these modes of fueling probably dominate the high Eddington ratio population at Seyfert luminosities (significant at z = 0), the constraints from quasar clustering, observed pseudobulge populations, and disk mass functions suggest that they are a small contributor to the z gtrsim 1 quasar luminosity density, which is dominated by massive BHs in predominantly classical spheroids formed in mergers. Similarly, low-luminosity Seyferts do not show a clustering excess on small scales, in agreement with the natural prediction of secular models, but bright quasars at all redshifts do so. We also compare recent observations of the colors of quasar host galaxies and show that these correspond to the colors of recent merger remnants, in the transition region between the blue cloud and the red sequence, and are distinct from the colors of systems with observed bars or strong disk instabilities. Even the most extreme secular models, in which all bulge (and therefore BH) formation proceeds via disk instability, are forced to assume that this instability acts before the (dynamically inevitable) mergers, and therefore predict a history for the quasar luminosity density that is shifted to earlier times, in disagreement with observations. Our model provides a powerful means to predict the abundance and nature of mergers and to contrast cosmologically motivated predictions of merger products such as starbursts and active galactic nuclei.},

  abstract      = {We develop and test a model for the cosmological role of mergers in the formation and quenching of red, early-type galaxies. By combining theoretically well-constrained halo and subhalo mass functions as a function of redshift and environment with empirical halo occupation models, we predict the distribution of mergers as a function of redshift, environment, and physical galaxy properties. Making the simple Ansatz that star formation is quenched after a gas-rich, spheroid-forming major merger, we demonstrate that this naturally predicts the turnover in the efficiency of star formation and baryon fractions in galaxies at \~{}L$_{*}$ (without any parameters tuned to this value), as well as the observed mass functions and mass density of red galaxies as a function of redshift, the formation times of early-type galaxies as a function of mass, and the fraction of quenched galaxies as a function of galaxy and halo mass, environment, and redshift. Comparing our model to a variety of semianalytic models in which quenching is primarily driven by halo mass considerations or secular/disk instabilities, we demonstrate that our model makes unique and robust qualitative predictions for a number of observables, including the bivariate red fraction as a function of galaxy and halo mass, the density of passive galaxies at high redshifts, the emergence/evolution of the color-morphology-density relations at high redshift, and the fraction of disky/boxy (or cusp/core) spheroids as a function of mass. In each case, the observations favor a model in which some mechanism quenches future star formation after a major merger builds a massive spheroid. Models where quenching is dominated by a halo mass threshold fail to match the behavior of the bivariate red fractions, predict too low a density of passive galaxies at high redshift, and overpredict by an order of magnitude the mass of the transition from disky to boxy ellipticals. Models driven by secular disk instabilities also qualitatively disagree with the bivariate red fractions, fail to predict the observed evolution in the color-density relations, and predict order-of-magnitude incorrect distributions of kinematic types in early-type galaxies. We make specific predictions for how future observations, for example, quantifying the red fraction as a function of galaxy mass, halo mass, environment, or redshift, can break the degeneracies between a number of different assumptions adopted in present galaxy formation models. We discuss a variety of physical possibilities for this quenching and propose a mixed scenario in which traditional quenching in hot, quasi-static massive halos is supplemented by the strong shocks and feedback energy input associated with a major merger (e.g., tidal shocks, starburst-driven winds, and quasar feedback), which temporarily suppress cooling and establish the conditions of a dynamically hot halo in the central regions of the host, even in low-mass halos (below the traditional threshold for accretion shocks).},

  abstract      = {We use semi-analytic modelling on top of the Millennium simulation to study the joint formation of galaxies and their embedded supermassive black holes. Our goal is to test scenarios in which black hole accretion and quasar activity are triggered by galaxy mergers, and to constrain different models for the light curves associated with individual quasar events. In the present work, we focus on studying the spatial distribution of simulated quasars. At all luminosities, we find that the simulated quasar two-point correlation function is fit well by a single power law in the range 0.5 $\lt$\~{} r $\lt$\~{} 20h$^{-1}$Mpc, but its normalization is a strong function of redshift. When we select only quasars with luminosities within the range typically accessible by today's quasar surveys, their clustering strength depends only weakly on luminosity, in agreement with observations. This holds independently of the assumed light-curve model, since bright quasars are black holes accreting close to the Eddington limit, and are hosted by dark matter haloes with a narrow mass range of a few 10$^{12}$h$^{-1}$M$_{solar}$. Therefore, the clustering of bright quasars cannot be used to disentangle light-curve models, but such a discrimination would become possible if the observational samples can be pushed to significantly fainter limits. Overall, our clustering results for the simulated quasar population agree rather well with observations, lending support to the conjecture that galaxy mergers could be the main physical process responsible for triggering black hole accretion and quasar activity.},

  abstract      = {We model the cosmological co-evolution of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes (BHs) within a semi-analytical framework developed on the outputs of the Millennium Simulation. This model, described in detail by Croton et al. and De Lucia and Blaizot, introduces a `radio mode' feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) at the centre of X-ray emitting atmospheres in galaxy groups and clusters. Thanks to this mechanism, the model can simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass dropout rate in cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off in the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function and (iii) the bulge-dominated morphologies and old stellar ages of the most massive galaxies in clusters. This paper is the first of a series in which we investigate how well this model can also reproduce the physical properties of BHs and AGN. Here we analyse the scaling relations, the fundamental plane and the mass function of BHs, and compare them with the most recent observational data. Moreover, we extend the semi-analytic model to follow the evolution of the BH mass accretion and its conversion into radiation, and compare the derived AGN bolometric luminosity function with the observed one. While we find for the most part a very good agreement between predicted and observed BH properties, the semi-analytic model underestimates the number density of luminous AGN at high redshifts, independently of the adopted Eddington factor and accretion efficiency. However, an agreement with the observations is possible within the framework of our model, provided it is assumed that the cold gas fraction accreted by BHs at high redshifts is larger than at low redshifts.},

  abstract = {We incorporate a simple scheme for the growth of supermassive black holes into semi-analytic models that follow the formation and evolution of galaxies in a cold dark matter-dominated Universe. We assume that supermassive black holes are formed and fuelled during major mergers. If two galaxies of comparable mass merge, their central black holes coalesce and a few per cent of the gas in the merger remnant is accreted by the new black hole over a time-scale of a few times 10$^{7}$yr. With these simple assumptions, our model not only fits many aspects of the observed evolution of galaxies, but also reproduces quantitatively the observed relation between bulge luminosity and black hole mass in nearby galaxies, the strong evolution of the quasar population with redshift, and the relation between the luminosities of nearby quasars and those of their host galaxies. The strong decline in the number density of quasars from z\~{}2 to z=0 is a result of the combination of three effects: (i) a decrease in the merging rate; (ii) a decrease in the amount of cold gas available to fuel black holes, and (iii) an increase in the time-scale for gas accretion. The predicted decline in the total content of cold gas in galaxies is consistent with that inferred from observations of damped Ly{$\alpha$} systems. Our results strongly suggest that the evolution of supermassive black holes, quasars and starburst galaxies is inextricably linked to the hierarchical build-up of galaxies.},

  abstract      = {High redshift quasars emit copious X-ray photons which heat the intergalactic medium to temperatures up to $\sim$ 10$^6$ K. At such high temperatures the primordial gas will not form stars until it is assembled into dark matter haloes with masses of $\sim$ 10$^{11}$ M$\_{\odot}$, at which point the hot gas collapses and cools under the influence of gravity. Once this occurs, there is a massive reservoir of primordial gas from which stars can form, potentially setting the stage for the brightest Population (Pop) III starbursts in the early Universe. Supporting this scenario, recent observations of quasars at z $\sim$ 6 have revealed a lack of accompanying Lyman $\alpha$ emitting galaxies, consistent with suppression of primordial star formation in haloes with masses below $\sim$ 10$^{10}$ M$\_{\odot}$. Here we model the chemical and thermal evolution of the primordial gas as it collapses into such a massive halo irradiated by a nearby quasar in the run-up to a massive Pop III starburst. We show that at distances of $\sim$ 1 Mpc from a typical quasar the conditions are prime for HD cooling to play a role in the evolution of the gas, possibly resulting in a shift to a lower characteristic stellar mass. Within $\sim$ 100 kpc of the highest redshift quasars discovered to date the Lyman-Werner flux produced by the stars in the quasar host galaxy may be high enough to stimulate the formation of a direct collapse black hole (DCBH). Given that metal-enriched outflows are expected to extend out to only $\simeq$ 50 kpc from high-z quasars, this suggests that there is ample unpolluted primordial gas for the formation of DCBHs and Pop III starbursts. How frequently these objects form can be constrained with the James Webb Space Telescope in the coming years.},

Key findings include: galaxy assembly correlates strongly with halo assembly; quenching at z$\gt$1 correlates strongly with halo mass; quenched fractions at fixed halo mass decrease with increasing redshift; massive quenched galaxies reside in higher-mass haloes than star-forming galaxies at fixed galaxy mass; star-forming and quenched galaxies' star formation histories at fixed mass differ most at z$\lt$0.5; satellites have large scatter in quenching timescales after infall, and have modestly higher quenched fractions than central galaxies; Planck cosmologies result in up to 0.3 dex lower stellar mass-halo mass ratios at early times; and, nonetheless, stellar mass-halo mass ratios rise at z$\gt$5. Also presented are revised stellar mass-halo mass relations for all, quenched, star-forming, central, and satellite galaxies; the dependence of star formation histories on halo mass, stellar mass, and galaxy SSFR; quenched fractions and quenching timescale distributions for satellites; and predictions for higher-redshift galaxy correlation functions and weak lensing surface densities.

  abstract      = {The predominantly ancient stellar populations observed in the lowest-mass galaxies (i.e. ultra-faint dwarfs) suggest that their star formation was suppressed (or ``quenched'') by reionization. Most of the well-studied ultra-faint dwarfs, however, are within the central half of the Milky Way dark matter halo, such that they are consistent with a population that was accreted at early times and thus potentially quenched via environmental processes. To study the potential role of environment in suppressing star formation on the smallest scales, we utilize the Exploring the Local Volume in Simulations (ELVIS) suite of $N$-body simulations to constrain the distribution of infall times for low-mass subhalos likely to host the ultra-faint population. For the ultra-faint satellites of the Milky Way with star-formation histories inferred from $Hubble~Space~Telescope$ imaging, we find that environment is highly unlikely to play a dominant role in quenching their star formation. Even when including the potential effects of pre-processing, there is a $\lesssim 1\\%$ probability that environmental processes quenched all of the known ultra-faint dwarfs early enough to explain their observed star-formation histories. Instead, we argue for a mass floor in the effectiveness of satellite quenching at roughly $M\_{\star} \sim 10^{5}~M\_{\odot}$, below which star formation in surviving galaxies is globally suppressed by reionization. We predict a large population of quenched ultra-faint dwarfs in the local field, with as many as $\sim 200$ to be discovered by future wide-field imaging surveys.},

Our results show that the colours of cluster and substructure members have consistent spatial distributions. In particular, the colour fractions of galaxies inside substructures follow the same spatial trends observed in the main clusters. Additionally, we find that at large cluster-centric distances $\backslash$mbox$\{$($r \geq r\_{200}$)$\}$ the fraction of blue galaxies in both the main clusters and in the substructures is always lower than the average fraction of UVJ-selected star-forming galaxies in the field as measured in the COSMOS/UltraVista data set.

We use the Zurich ENvironmental Study (ZENS), which is a survey of galaxy groups with a large fraction of satellite galaxies. QGs shape a narrow locus in the {$\Sigma$}$_{1}$-M $_{⋆}$ plane, which we refer to as {$\Sigma$}$_{1}$ ridgeline. Colors of (B - I) and (I - J) are used to divide QGs into three age categories: young ($\lt$2 Gyr), intermediate (2-4 Gyr), and old ($\gt$4 Gyr). At fixed stellar mass, old QGs on the {$\Sigma$}$_{1}$ ridgeline have higher {$\Sigma$}$_{1}$ than young QGs. This shows that galaxies landing on the {$\Sigma$}$_{1}$ ridgeline at later epochs arrive with lower {$\Sigma$}$_{1}$, which drives the zeropoint of the ridgeline down with time. We compare the present-day zeropoint of the oldest population at z = 0 with the zeropoint of the quiescent population 4 Gyr back in time, at z = 0.37. These zeropoints are identical, showing that the intrinsic evolution of individual galaxies after they arrive on the {$\Sigma$}$_{1}$ ridgeline must be negligible, or must evolve parallel to the ridgeline during this interval. The observed evolution of the global zeropoint of 0.07 dex over the last 4 Gyr is thus largely due to the continuous addition of newly quenched galaxies with lower {$\Sigma$}$_{1}$ at later times ({\ldquo}progenitor bias{\rdquo}). While these results refer to the satellite-rich ZENS sample as a whole, our work suggests a similar age-{$\Sigma$}$_{1}$ trend for central galaxies.},

  abstract      = {We investigate the roles of two classes of quenching mechanisms for central and satellite galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (z $\lt$ 0.075): those involving the halo and those involving the formation of a compact centre. For central galaxies with inner compactness {$\Sigma$}$_{1 kpc}$ {\tilde} 10$^{9-9.4}$ M$_{⊙}$ kpc$^{-2}$, the quenched fraction f$_{q}$ is strongly correlated with {$\Sigma$}$_{1 kpc}$ with only weak halo mass M$_{h}$ dependence. However, at higher and lower {$\Sigma$}$_{1 kpc}$, specific star formation rate (sSFR) is a strong function of M$_{h}$ and mostly independent of {$\Sigma$}$_{1 kpc}$. In other words, {$\Sigma$}$_{1 kpc}$ {\tilde} 10$^{9-9.4}$ M$_{⊙}$ kpc$^{-2}$ divides galaxies into those with high sSFR below and low sSFR above this range. In both the upper and lower regimes, increasing M$_{h}$ shifts the entire sSFR distribution to lower sSFR without a qualitative change in shape. This is true even at fixed M$_{*}$, but varying M$_{*}$ at fixed M$_{h}$ adds no quenching information. Most of the quenched centrals with M$_{h}$ $\gt$ 10$^{11.8}$ M$_{⊙}$ are dense ({$\Sigma$}$_{1 kpc}$ $\gt$ 10$^{9}$ M$_{⊙}$ kpc$^{-2}$), suggesting compaction-related quenching maintained by halo-related quenching. However, 21 per cent are diffuse, indicating only halo quenching. For satellite galaxies in the outskirts of haloes, quenching is a strong function of compactness and a weak function of host M$_{h}$. In the inner halo, M$_{h}$ dominates quenching, with {\tilde}90 per cent of the satellites being quenched once M$_{h}$ $\gt$ 10$^{13}$ M$_{⊙}$. This regional effect is greatest for the least massive satellites. As demonstrated via semi-analytic modelling with simple prescriptions for quenching, the observed correlations can be explained if quenching due to central compactness is rapid while quenching due to halo mass is slow.},

  abstract      = {Modern data empower observers to describe galaxies as the spatially and biographically complex objects they are. We illustrate this through case studies of four z {\sim} 1.3 systems based on deep, spatially resolved, 17-band + G102 + G141 Hubble Space Telescope grism spectrophotometry. Using full-spectrum rest-UV/-optical continuum fitting, we characterize these galaxies{\rsquo} observed {\sim}kpc-scale structures and star formation rates (SFRs) and reconstruct their history over the age of the universe. The sample{\rsquo}s diversity{\mdash}passive to vigorously star-forming; stellar masses log $\{$M$\}$$_{* }$/$\{$M$\}$$_{ȯ }$ = 10.5 to 11.2{\mdash}enables us to draw spatiotemporal inferences relevant to key areas of parameter space (Milky Way{\ndash} to super-M31{\ndash}mass progenitors). Specifically, we find signs that bulge mass fractions (B/T) and SF history shapes/spatial uniformity are linked, such that higher B/Ts correlate with {\ldquo}inside-out growth{\rdquo} and central specific SFRs that peaked above the global average for all star-forming galaxies at that epoch. Conversely, the system with the lowest B/T had a flat, spatially uniform SFH with normal peak activity. Both findings are consistent with models positing a feedback-driven connection between bulge formation and the switch from rising to falling SFRs ({\ldquo}quenching{\rdquo}). While sample size forces this conclusion to remain tentative, this work provides a proof-of-concept for future efforts to refine or refute it: JWST, WFIRST, and the 30 m class telescopes will routinely produce data amenable to this and more sophisticated analyses. Such samples spanning representative mass, redshift, SFR, and environmental regimes will be ripe for converting into thousands of subgalactic-scale empirical windows on what individual systems actually looked like in the past, ushering in a new dialogue between observation and theory.

With the sensitivity and spacing of MIRI filters, we will detect $\gt$4 times as many AGN hosts as with Spitzer/IRAC criteria. Any star formation rates based on the 7.7 {$\mu$}m PAH feature (likely to be applied to MIRI photometry) must be corrected for the contribution of the AGN, or the star formation rate will be overestimated by {\tilde}35\% for cases where the AGN provides half the IR luminosity and {\tilde}50\% when the AGN accounts for 90\% of the luminosity. Finally, we demonstrate that our MIRI color technique can select AGNs with an Eddington ratio of $\{${$\lambda$} $\}$$_{Edd}$$\}${\tilde} 0.01 and will identify AGN hosts with a higher specific star formation rate than X-ray techniques alone. JWST/MIRI will enable critical steps forward in identifying and understanding dust-obscured AGNs and the link to their host galaxies.},

  abstract      = {[abridged] This work aims to observationally investigate the history of size growth of early-type galaxies and how the growth depends on cosmic epoch and the mass of the halo in which they are embedded. We carried out a photometric and structural analysis in the rest-frame $V$ band of a mass-selected ($\log M/M\_\odot \gt10.7$) sample of red-sequence early-type galaxies with spectroscopic/grism redshift in the general field up to $z=2$ to complement a previous work presenting an identical analysis but in halos 100 times more massive and 1000 times denser. We homogeneously derived sizes (effective radii) fully accounting for the multi-component nature of galaxies and the common presence of isophote twists and ellipticity gradients. By using these mass-selected samples, composed of 170 red-sequence early-type galaxies in the general field and 224 identically selected and analyzed in clusters, we isolate the effect on galaxy sizes of the halo in which galaxies are embedded and its dependence on epoch. We find that the $\log$ of the galaxy size at a fixed stellar mass, $\log M/M\_\odot= 11$, has increased with epoch at a rate twice as fast in the field than in cluster in the last 10 Gyr ($0.26\pm0.03$ versus $0.13\pm0.02$ dex per unit redshift). Red-sequence early-type galaxies in the general field reached the size of their cousins in denser environment by $z=0.25\pm0.13$ in spite of being three times smaller at $z\sim2$. Data point toward a model where size growth is epoch-independent (i.e., $\partial \log r\_e /\partial z = c$), but with a rate $c$ depending on environment, $\partial c /\partial \log M\_{halo} \approx 0.05$. Environment determines the growth rate ($d \log r\_e / dz$) at all redshifts, indicating an external origin for the galaxy growth without any clear epoch where it ceases to have an effect.},

We obtain spectroscopic redshifts for half of the sample, using absorption or emission lines, and confirm the high accuracy of the photometric redshifts with a median error of 1.2\%. Two galaxies turn out to be dusty objects at lower redshifts (z$\lt$2.5), and are the only two detected in the sub-mm with ALMA. High equivalent-width [OIII] was observed in two galaxies, contributing up to 30\% of the K-band flux and mimicking the colors of an old stellar population. This implies a failure rate of only 20\% for the UVJ selection at these redshifts. Balmer absorption was identified in 4 of the brighest galaxies, confirming the absence of OB stars. Modeling all QGs with a wide range of star-formation histories, we find sSFR a factor of 10 below the main sequence (MS) for all but one galaxy, and less than 0.01 Gyr$^{-1}$ for half of the sample. This is consistent with the H$\beta$ and [OII] luminosities, and the ALMA non-detections. We then find that these QGs have quenched on average 300 Myr before observation, between z=3.5 and 5, and that they formed at z\~{}5.5 with a mean SFR\~{}300 Msun/yr. Considering an alternative selection of QGs based solely on the sSFR from SED modeling, we find that galaxies a factor 10 below the MS are 40\% more numerous than UVJ-quiescent galaxies, implying that the UVJ selection is pure but incomplete. Current models fail at reproducing our observations and underestimate either the number density of QGs by more than an order of magnitude or the duration of their quiescence by a factor two. Overall, these results confirm the existence of an unexpected population of QGs at z$\gt$3, and offer the first insights on their formation history. [abridged]},

  abstract      = {Evolved asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and Type Ia supernovae (SNe) are important contributors to the elements that form dust in the interstellar medium of galaxies, in particular, carbon and iron. However, they require at least a Gyr to start producing these elements, therefore, a change in dust quantity or properties may appear at high redshifts. In this work, we use extinction of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows as a tool to look for variations in dust properties at z$\gt$3. We use a spectroscopically selected sample of GRB afterglows observed with the VLT/X-shooter instrument to determine extinction curves out to high redshifts. We present ten new z$\gt$3 X-shooter GRBs of which six are dusty. Combining these with individual extinction curves of three previously known z$\gt$3 GRBs, we find an average extinction curve consistent with the SMC-Bar. A comparison with spectroscopically selected GRBs at all redshifts indicates a drop in visual extinction (A\_V) at z$\gt$3.5 with no moderate or high extinction bursts. We check for observational bias using template spectra and find that GRBs up to z\~{}8 are detectable with X-shooter up to A\_V\~{}0.3 mag. Although other biases are noted, a uniformly low dust content above z$\gt$3.5 indicates a real drop, suggesting a transition in dust properties and/or available dust building blocks. The remarkable increase in dust content at z$\lt$3.5 could arise due to carbon and possibly iron production by the first carbon-rich AGB and Type Ia SNe, respectively. Alternatively, z$\gt$3.5 dust drop could be the result of low stellar masses of GRB host galaxies.},

  abstract      = {The goal of the Local Cluster Survey is to look for evidence of environmentally driven quenching among star-forming galaxies in nearby galaxy groups and clusters. Quenching is linked with environment and stellar mass, and much of the current observational evidence comes from the integrated properties of galaxies. However, the relative size of the stellar and star-forming disk is sensitive to environmental processing and can help identify the mechanisms that lead to a large fraction of quenched galaxies in dense environments. Toward this end, we measure the size of the star-forming disks for 224 galaxies in nine groups and clusters (0.02$\lt$z$\lt$0.04; SFR $\gt$ 0.1 M$\_\odot$/yr) using 24um imaging from the Spitzer Space Telescope. We normalize the 24um effective radius (R24) by the size of the stellar disk (Rd). We find that star-forming galaxies with higher bulge-to-total ratios (B/T) and galaxies in more dense environments have more centrally concentrated star formation. Comparison with H\~{}I mass fractions and NUV-r colors indicates that a galaxy's transition from gas-rich and blue to depleted and red is accompanied by an increase in the central concentration of star formation. We build a simple model to constrain the timescale over which the star-forming disks shrink in the cluster environment. Our results are consistent with a long-timescale ($\gt$2Gyr) mechanism that produces outside-in quenching, such as the removal of the extended gas halo or weak stripping of the cold disk gas.},

The aim of this work is to measure the cold gas reservoir of three highly obscured QSOs to test if their gas fraction is similar to that of sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs), as expected by some models, and place these measurements in the context of the SB-QSO framework. We target CO(1-0) transition in BzK4892, a Compton Thick (CT) QSO at z=2.6, CO(1-0) in BzK8608 and CO(2-1) in CDF153, two highly obscured QSOs at z=2.5 and z=1.5, respectively. For all these targets, we place 3$\sigma$ upper limits on the CO, with $L'\_{CO} \lt (1.5\div 2.8)\times 10^{10}$ K km/s pc$^2$. We also compare the molecular gas conditions of our targets with those of other systems at z$\gt$1, considering normal star forming galaxies and SMGs, unobscured and obscured AGN from the literature. For the AGN samples, we provide an updated and (almost) complete collection of targets with CO follow-up. BzK4892 displays a high star formation efficiency (SFE$=L\_{IR}/L'\_{CO}\gt410$ L$\_{\odot}$/(K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$)) and a gas fraction $f\_{gas}\lt0.1$. Less stringent constraints are derived for the other two targets ($f\_{gas}\lt0.5$ and SFE$\gt10$). From the comparison with literature data, we found that a) obscured AGN at z$\gt$1 are associated with higher SFE and lower $f\_{gas}$ with respect to star forming galaxies; b) mildly and highly obscured active galaxies have comparable gas fractions; c) the SFE of CT and obscured AGN are similar to those of unobscured AGN. Within the SB-QSO framework, these findings could be consistent with a scenario where feedback can impact the host galaxy already from the early phases of the SB-QSO sequence.},

ORELSE is a large photometric and spectroscopic campaign dedicated to mapping out and characterizing galaxy properties across a full range of environments in 15 fields containing large-scale structures (LSSs) in a redshift range of $0.6 \lt z \lt 1.3$. We constrained the rotation velocity for our kinematic sample in an ORELSE field, containing the SC1604 supercluster, by fitting high-resolution semi-analytical models to the data. We constructed the stellar-mass/B-band Tully-Fisher relation and found no dependence of the intrinsic scatter on both local and global environment. Moreover, we compared the stellar-to-dynamical mass ratio ($M\_\ast/M\_{dyn}$) of SC1604 galaxies to those residing in less dense local environment by leveraging data from the HR-COSMOS sample. We found that, at fixed stellar mass, SC1604 galaxies have $\sim30\\%$ smaller dynamical masses on average. By comparing the distributions of the galaxy parameters that define $M\_{dyn}$ (i.e., circular velocity and the characteristic radius $r\_{2.2}$) between SC1604 and HR-COSMOS, we found that smaller dynamical masses are mostly caused by smaller $r\_{2.2}$ for SC1604 galaxies. We also observed that SC1604 galaxies in general show $\sim20\\%$ lower stellar specific angular momentum ($j\_\ast$) with respect to the HR-COSMOS sample. Adopting literature estimates for (1) the excess rate of galaxy-galaxy mergers in intermediate/high-density environments and (2) the average amount of $j\_\ast$ loss per merger event, we investigated the possibility that galaxy mergers are mainly responsible for the loss of angular momentum in higher density environments.},

  abstract      = {A key task of observational extragalactic astronomy is to determine where -- within galaxies of diverse masses and morphologies -- stellar mass growth occurs, how it depends on galaxy properties and what processes regulate star formation. Using spectroscopic indices derived from the stellar continuum at $\sim 4000$$\backslash$AA, we determine the spatially resolved star-formation histories of 980000 spaxels in 2404 galaxies in the SDSS-IV MaNGA IFU survey. We examine the spatial distribution of star-forming, quiescent, green valley, starburst and post-starburst spaxels as a function of stellar mass and morphology to see where and in what types of galaxy star formation is occurring. The spatial distribution of star-formation is dependent primarily on stellar mass, with a noticeable change in the distribution at $\backslash$mstar$\gt10^{10}$$\backslash$msun. Galaxies above this mass have an increasing fraction of regions that are forming stars with increasing radius, whereas lower mass galaxies have a constant fraction of star forming regions with radius. Our findings support a picture of inside-out growth and quenching at high masses. We find that morphology (measured via concentration) correlates with the fraction of star-forming spaxels, but not with their radial distribution. We find (post-)starburst regions are more common outside of the galaxy centre, are preferentially found in asymmetric galaxies, and have lower gas-phase metallicity than other regions, consistent with interactions triggering starbursts and driving low metallicity gas into regions at $\lt1.5R\_e$.},

We have performed a seeing convolved 2D single S$\backslash$'ersic fit to the galaxy images in the 4 photometric bands (u, g, r, i) observed by KiDS, by selecting high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N $\gt$ 50) systems in every bands. We have classified galaxies as spheroids and disc-dominated by combining their spectral energy distribution properties and their S$\backslash$'ersic index. Using photometric redshifts derived from a machine learning technique, we have determined the evolution of the effective radius, $\backslash$Re$\backslash$ and stellar mass, $\backslash$mst, versus redshift, for both mass complete samples of spheroids and disc-dominated galaxies up to z \~{} 0.6. Our results show a significant evolution of the structural quantities at intermediate redshift for the massive spheroids ($\mbox{Log}\ M\_*/M\_\odot\gt11$, Chabrier IMF), while almost no evolution has found for less massive ones ($\mbox{Log}\ M\_*/M\_\odot \lt 11$). On the other hand, disc dominated systems show a milder evolution in the less massive systems ($\mbox{Log}\ M\_*/M\_\odot \lt 11$) and possibly no evolution of the more massive systems. These trends are generally consistent with predictions from hydrodynamical simulations and independent datasets out to redshift z \~{} 0.6, although in some cases the scatter of the data is large to drive final conclusions. These results, based on 1/10 of the expected KiDS area, reinforce precedent finding based on smaller statistical samples and show the route toward more accurate results, expected with the the next survey releases.},

  abstract      = {Nuclear outflows driven by accreting massive black holes are one of the main feedback mechanisms invoked at high-z to reproduce the distinct separation between star-forming, disk galaxies and quiescent spheroidal systems. Yet, our knowledge of feedback at high-z remains limited by the lack of observations of the multiple gas phases in galaxy outflows. In this work we use new deep, high-spatial resolution ALMA CO(3-2) and archival VLT/SINFONI H$\alpha$ observations to study the molecular and ionized components of the AGN-driven outflow in zC400528 ---a massive, main sequence galaxy at z=2.3 in the process of quenching. We detect a powerful molecular outflow that shows a positive velocity gradient and extends for at least \~{}10 kpc from the nuclear region, about three times the projected size of the ionized wind. The molecular gas in the outflow does not reach velocities high enough to escape the galaxy and is therefore expected to be reaccreted. Keeping in mind the various assumptions involved in the analysis, we find that the mass and energetics of the outflow are dominated by the molecular phase. The AGN-driven outflow in zC400528 is powerful enough to deplete the molecular gas reservoir on a timescale at least twice shorter than that needed to exhaust it by star formation. This suggests that the nuclear outflow is one of the main quenching engines at work in the observed suppression of the central star-formation activity in zC400528.},

We find low-velocity outflows to be prevalent in regions of high SFRs and stellar masses (10 $\lesssim$log M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$ $\lesssim$ 11.5), however we do not find any detections in the low mass (log M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$ $\lesssim$ 10) regime. We also find tentative detections of inflowing gas in high mass galaxies across the star forming populations. We derive mass outflow rates with ranges 0.14-1.74\,M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ and upper limits on inflow rates <2 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, allowing us to place constraints on the mass loading factor ($\eta$=$\dot{M}_{\text{out}}$/SFR) for use in simulations of the local Universe. We discuss the fate of the outflows by comparing the force provided by the starburst to the critical force needed to push the outflow outward, and find the vast majority of the outflows unlikely to escape the host system. Finally, as outflow detection rates and central velocities do not vary strongly with the presence of a (weak) active supermassive black hole, we determine that star formation appears to be the primary driver of outflows at $z\sim$0.},

  abstract    = {We present new measurements of the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMF) and UV luminosity functions (UV LF) for galaxies from $z=6-9$ within the Frontier Field cluster MACSJ0416.1-2403 and its parallel field. To obtain these results, we derive the stellar masses of our sample by fitting synthetic stellar population models to their observed spectral energy distribution with the inclusion of nebular emission lines. This is the deepest and farthest in distance mass function measured to date and probes down to a level of M$_{*} = 10^{6.8}M_{\odot}$. The main result of this study is that the low-mass end of our stellar mass functions to these limits and redshifts continues to become steeper from $-1.96_{-0.04}^{+0.04}$ at $z=6$ to $-2.38_{-0.25}^{+0.30}$ at $z=9$, steeper than previously observed, and we find no evidence of turnover in the mass range probed. We furthermore demonstrate that the UV LF for these system also continues to show a steepening at the highest redshifts, without any evidence of turnover in the luminosity range probed. Our $M_{\mathrm{UV}}-M_{*}$ relation exhibit shallower slopes than previously observed and are in accordance with a constant mass-to-light ratio. Integrating our GSMF, we find that the stellar mass density increases by a factor of $\sim12$, from log$_{10}\rho_{*}=5.63_{-0.89}^{+0.91}$ at $z=9$ to log$_{10}\rho_{*}=6.74_{-0.12}^{+0.09}$ at $z=6$. We estimate the dust-corrected star formation rates (SFRs) to calculate the specific star formation rates ($\mathrm{sSFR}=\mathrm{SFR/M_{*}}$) of our sample, and find that for a fixed stellar mass of $5\times10^{9}M_{\odot}$, sSFR $\propto(1+z)^{2.01\pm0.16}$. Finally, from our new measurements, we estimate the UV luminosity density ($\rho_{\textrm{UV}}$) and find that our results support a smooth decline of $\rho_{\textrm{UV}}$ towards high redshifts.},

The same holds for the quenched fractions as a function of central velocity dispersion, which is tightly correlated with black hole mass, as long as one controls for both stellar and halo mass. Here we use mock galaxy catalogs constructed from the latest semi-analytic model, L-GALAXIES, and the state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulation, EAGLE, to investigate whether these models can reproduce the trends seen in the data. We also check how the group finder used to identify centrals and satellites impacts our results. We find that L-GALAXIES fails to reproduce the trends. The predicted quenched fraction of central galaxies increases sharply with halo mass around $10^{12.5}h^{-1}M\_{\odot}$ and with black hole mass around $\sim10^{6.5}M\_{\odot}$, while the predicted quenched fraction of satellites increases with both halo and black hole masses gradually. In contrast, centrals and satellites in EAGLE follow almost the same trend as seen in the data. We discuss the implications of our results for how feedback processes regulate galaxy quenching.},

  abstract      = {We use three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of vertically stratified patches of galactic discs to study how the spatio-temporal clustering of supernovae (SNe) enhances the power of galactic winds. SNe that are randomly distributed throughout a galactic disc drive inefficient galactic winds because most supernova remnants lose their energy radiatively before breaking out of the disc. Accounting for the fact that most star formation is clustered alleviates this problem. Super-bubbles driven by the combined effects of clustered SNe propagate rapidly enough to break out of galactic discs well before the clusters' SNe stop going off. The radiative losses post-breakout are reduced dramatically and a large fraction ($\gtrsim 0.2$) of the energy released by SNe vents into the halo powering a strong galactic wind. These energetic winds are capable of providing strong preventative feedback and eject substantial mass from the galaxy with outflow rates on the order of the star formation rate. The momentum flux in the wind is only of order that injected by the SNe, because the hot gas vents before doing significant work on the surroundings. We show that our conclusions hold for a range of galaxy properties, both in the local Universe (e.g., M82) and at high redshift (e.g., $z \sim 2$ star forming galaxies). We further show that if the efficiency of forming star clusters increases with increasing gas surface density, as suggested by theoretical arguments, the condition for star cluster-driven super-bubbles to break out of galactic discs corresponds to a threshold star formation rate surface density for the onset of galactic winds $\sim 0.03$ M$\_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$, of order that observed.},

We use Horizon-AGN, a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, to perform a comprehensive study of the processes that drive morphological change in massive (M $\gt$ 10\^{}10 MSun) galaxies over cosmic time. We show that (1) essentially all the morphological evolution in galaxies that are spheroids at z=0 is driven by mergers with mass ratios greater than 1:10, (2) major mergers alone cannot produce today's spheroid population -- minor mergers are responsible for a third of all morphological transformation over cosmic time and are its dominant driver after z\~{}1, (3) prograde mergers trigger milder morphological transformation than retrograde mergers -- while both types of events produce similar morphological changes at z$\gt$2, the average change due to retrograde mergers is around twice that due to their prograde counterparts at z\~{}0, (4) remnant morphology depends strongly on the gas fraction of a merger, with gas-rich mergers routinely re-growing discs, and (5) at a given stellar mass, discs do not exhibit drastically different merger histories from spheroids -- disc survival in mergers is driven by acquisition of cold gas (via cosmological accretion and gas-rich interactions) and a preponderance of prograde mergers in their merger histories.},

  abstract      = {The majority of spiral and elliptical galaxies in the Universe host very dense and compact stellar systems at their centres known as nuclear star clusters (NSCs). In this work we study the stellar populations and star formation histories (SFH) of the NSCs of six nearby galaxies with stellar masses ranging between $2$ and $8\times10^9~{\rm M\_{\odot}}$ (four late-type spirals and two early-types) with high resolution spectroscopy. Our observations are taken with the X-Shooter spectrograph at the VLT. We make use of an empirical simple stellar population (SSP) model grid to fit composite stellar populations to the data and recover the SFHs of the nuclei. We find that the nuclei of all late-type galaxies experienced a prolonged SFH, while the NSCs of the two early-types are consistent with SSPs. The NSCs in the late-type galaxies sample appear to have formed a significant fraction of their stellar mass already more than $10$ Gyr ago, while the NSCs in the two early-type galaxies are surprisingly younger. Stars younger than $100$ Myr are present in at least two nuclei: NGC 247 and NGC 7793, with some evidence for young star formation in NGC 300's NSC. The NSCs of the spirals NGC 247 and NGC 300 are consistent with prolonged $\backslash$in situ star formation with a gradual metallicity enrichment from $\sim-1.5$ dex more than $10$ Gyr ago, reaching super-Solar values few hundred Myr ago. NGC 3621 appears to be very metal rich already in the early Universe and NGC 7793 presents us with a very complex SFH, likely dominated by merging of various massive star clusters coming from different environments.},

  abstract      = {It has recently been shown that the abundance of cold neutral gas may follow a similar evolution as the star formation history. This is physically motivated, since stars form out of this component of the neutral gas and if the case, would resolve the longstanding issue that there is a clear disparity between the total abundance of neutral gas and star forming activity over the history of the Universe. Radio-band 21-cm absorption traces the cold gas and comparison with the Lyman-alpha absorption, which traces all of the gas, provides a measure of the cold gas fraction or the spin temperature. The recent study has shown that the spin temperature (degenerate with the ratio of the absorber/emitter extent) appears to be anti-correlated with the star formation density, undergoing a similar steep evolution as the star formation rate over redshifts of 0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3, whereas the total neutral hydrogen exhibits little evolution. Above z $\gt$ 3, where the SFR shows a steep decline with redshift, there is insufficient 21-cm data to determine whether the spin temperature continues to follow the SFR. Knowing this is paramount in ascertaining whether the cold neutral gas does trace the star formation over the Universe's history. We explore the feasibility of resolving this with 21-cm observations of the largest contemporary sample of reliable damped Lyman-alpha absorption systems and conclude that, while today's largest radio interferometers can reach the required sensitivity at z $\lt$ 3.5, the Square Kilometre Array is required to probe to higher redshifts.},

We resolve molecular gas on scales of approximately 1-2 kpc, and our main finding is the discovery of a wing of blueshifted CO(2-1) emission out to -1000 km/s relative to the stars. We argue that this is the molecular component of a multiphase outflow, expelled from the central starburst within the past 5 Myr through stellar feedback, although we cannot rule out previous AGN activity as a launching mechanism. If the latter is true, then this is an example of a relic multiphase AGN outflow. We estimate a molecular mass outflow rate of approximately 300 M\_Sun/yr, or about one third of the 10 Myr-averaged star formation rate. This system epitomizes the multiphase 'blowout' episode following a dissipational major merger - a process that has violently quenched central star formation and supermassive black hole growth.},

The cluster selection is to first order independent of galaxy properties, making the SPT-SZ sample particularly well suited for cluster galaxy population studies. We carry out a 4-band imaging campaign with the $\{$$\backslash$it Hubble$\}$ and $\{$$\backslash$it Spitzer$\}$ Space Telescopes of the five $z\gtrsim 1.4$, S/N$\_{SZE}\gt$5 clusters, that are among the rarest most massive clusters known at this redshift. All five show clear overdensities of red galaxies whose colors agree with the initial cluster redshift estimates. The highest redshift cluster in this sample, SPT-CLJ0459-4947 at $z\sim1.72$, is the most distant $M\_{500}\gt10^{14}~M\_{\odot}$ ICM-selected cluster discovered thus far, and is one of only three known clusters in this mass range at $z\gtrsim 1.7$, regardless of selection. Based on UVJ-like photometric classification of quiescent and star-forming galaxies, the passive fraction in the cluster central regions ($r/r\_{500}\lt0.7$) is higher than in the field at the same redshift, with corresponding environmental quenching efficiencies typically in the range $\sim0.5-0.8$ for stellar masses $\log(M/M\_{\odot})\gt10.85$. We have explored the impact of emission from star formation on the selection of this sample, concluding that all five clusters studied here would still have been detected with S/N$\_{SZE}\gt$5, even if they had the same passive fraction as measured in the field. Our results thus point towards an efficient suppression of star formation in massive galaxies in the central regions of the most massive clusters, occurring already earlier than $z\sim1.5$.

Based on this analysis we extract a sample of \~{}150,000 SFRs and stellar masses that mimic a single cosmological survey covering the redshift range between z\~{}0 to z\~{}7. We confirm that the Star-Forming Main Sequence holds as a tight relation in this range of redshifts, and evolves strongly in both the zero-point and slope. This evolution is different for the population of local star-forming (SFGs) and retired (RGs) galaxies, with the latter presenting a stronger evolution in the zero-point and a weaker evolution in the slope. The fraction of RGs decreases rapidly with z, particularly for those classified as RGs at z\~{}0. Contrary to previous studies we detect RGs well above z$\gt$1, although not all of them are progenitors of local RGs. Finally, adopting the required corrections to make the survey complete in mass in a limited volume, we recover the cosmic star-formation rate (SFR), stellar mass density, and average specific SFR histories of the Universe in this wide range of look-back times, with a remarkable agreement with the values reported by various cosmological surveys. We demonstrate that the progenitors of local RGs were more actively forming stars in the past, contributing to most of the cosmic SFR density at z$\gt$0.5, and to most of the cosmic stellar mass density at any redshift. They suffer a general quenching in the SFR at z\~{}0.35. Below this redshift the progenitors of local SFGs dominate the SFR density of the Universe.},

  abstract      = {We present new determinations of the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) at z = 0-10 that match the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function, the star formation rate (SFR)-M$_{*}$ relation and the cosmic SFR. We utilize a compilation of 40 observational studies from the literature and correct them for potential biases. Using our robust determinations of halo mass assembly and the SHMR, we infer star formation histories, merger rates and structural properties for average galaxies, combining star-forming and quenched galaxies. Our main findings are as follows: (1) The halo mass M$_{50}$ above which 50 per cent of galaxies are quenched coincides with sSFR/sMAR {\tilde} 1, where sSFR is the specific SFR and sMAR is the specific halo mass accretion rate. (2) M$_{50}$ increases with redshift, presumably due to cold streams being more efficient at high redshifts, while virial shocks and active galactic nucleus feedback become more relevant at lower redshifts. (3) The ratio sSFR/sMAR has a peak value, which occurs around $\{$M\_vir$\}${\tilde} 2{\times} 10\^{}$\{$11$\}$ M\_$\{${\sun}$\}$. (4) The stellar mass density within 1 kpc, {$\Sigma$}$_{1}$, is a good indicator of the galactic global sSFR. (5) Galaxies are statistically quenched after they reach a maximum in {$\Sigma$}$_{1}$, consistent with theoretical expectations of the gas compaction model; this maximum depends on redshift. (6) In-situ star formation is responsible for most galactic stellar mass growth, especially for lower mass galaxies. (7) Galaxies grow inside-out. The marked change in the slope of the size-mass relation when galaxies became quenched, from d log $\{$R\_eff$\}$/d log $\{$M\_*$\}${\tilde} 0.35 to {\tilde}2.5, could be the result of dry minor mergers.},

  abstract    = {We present an update to the chemical enrichment component of the smoothed-particle hydrodynamics model for galaxy formation presented in Scannapieco et al. (2005) in order to address the needs of modelling galactic chemical evolution in realistic cosmological environments. Attribution of the galaxy-scale abundance patterns to individual enrichment mechanisms such as the winds from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars or the presence of a prompt fraction of Type Ia supernovae is complicated by the interaction between them and gas cooling, subsequent star formation and gas ejection. In this work we address the resulting degeneracies by extending our implementation to a suite of mechanisms that encompasses different IMFs, models for yields from the aforementioned stars, models for the prompt component of the delay-time-distribution (DTDs) for Type Ia SNe and metallicity-dependent gas cooling rates, and then applying these to both isolated initial conditions and cosmological hydrodynamical zoom simulations. We find DTDs with a large prompt fraction (such as the bimodal and power-law models) have, at z=0, similar abundance patterns compared to the low-prompt component time distributions (uniform or wide Gaussian models). However, some differences appear, such as the former having systematically higher [X/Fe] ratios and narrower [O/Fe] distributions compared to the latter, and a distinct evolution of the [Fe/H] abundance.},

  abstract      = {Although there has been much progress in understanding how galaxies evolve, we still do not understand how and when they stop forming stars and become quiescent. We address this by applying our galaxy spectral energy distribution models, which incorporate physically motivated star formation histories (SFHs) from cosmological simulations, to a sample of quiescent galaxies at 0.2$\backslash$lt z$\backslash$lt 2.1. A total of 845 quiescent galaxies with multi-band photometry spanning rest-frame ultraviolet through near-infrared wavelengths are selected from the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) data set. We compute median SFHs of these galaxies in bins of stellar mass and redshift. At all redshifts and stellar masses, the median SFHs rise, reach a peak, and then decline to reach quiescence. At high redshift, we find that the rise and decline are fast, as expected, because the universe is young. At low redshift, the duration of these phases depends strongly on stellar mass. Low-mass galaxies ($\{$log$\}$($\{$M$\}$$_{* }$/$\{$M$\}$$_{⊙ }$){\tilde} 9.5) grow on average slowly, take a long time to reach their peak of star formation ({\gsim} 4 Gyr), and then the declining phase is fast ({\lsim} 2 Gyr). Conversely, high-mass galaxies ($\{$log$\}$($\{$M$\}$$_{* }$/$\{$M$\}$$_{⊙ }$){\tilde} 11) grow on average fast ({\lsim} 2 Gyr), and, after reaching their peak, decrease the star formation slowly ({\gsim} 3). These findings are consistent with galaxy stellar mass being a driving factor in determining how evolved galaxies are, with high-mass galaxies being the most evolved at any time (I.e., downsizing). The different durations we observe in the declining phases also suggest that low- and high-mass galaxies experience different quenching mechanisms, which operate on different timescales.},

  abstract      = {Variations of star formation activity may happen on a large range of timescales and some of them are expected to be short, that is, a few hundred million years. The study of the physical processes linked to these rapid variations requires large statistical samples to pinpoint galaxies undergoing such transformations. Building upon a previous study, we define a method to blindly identify galaxies that have undergone, and may still be undergoing, a fast downfall of their star formation activity, that is, a more than 80\% drop in star formation rate (SFR) occurring in less than 500 Myr. Modeling galaxies' spectral energy distribution (SED) with a delayed-{$\tau$} star formation history, with and without allowing an instantaneous SFR drop within the last hundred million years, we isolate 102 candidates out of a subsample of 6680 galaxies classified as ``star forming'' from the UVJ criterion in the ZFOURGE catalogs. These galaxies are mostly located in the lower part of the SFR-M$_{*}$ main sequence (MS) and extend up to a factor 100 below it. They also lie close to the limit between the passive and active regions on the UVJ diagram, indicating that they are in a transition phase. We show that the selected candidates have different physical properties compared to galaxies with similar UVJ colors, namely, lower SFRs and different stellar masses. The morphology of the candidates shows no preference for a particular type. Among the 102 candidates, only 4 show signs of a active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity (from X-ray luminosity or ultraviolet-infrared (UV-IR) SED fitting decomposition). This low fraction of AGNs among the candidates implies that AGN activity may not be the main driver of the recent downfall, although timescale differences and duty cycle must be taken into account. We finally attempt to recover the past position of these galaxies on the SFR-M$_{*}$ plane, before the downfall of their star formation and show that some of them were in the starburst region before, and are now back on the MS. These candidates constitute a promising sample that needs more investigation in order to understand the different mechanisms at the origin of the star formation decrease of the Universe since z   2.},

  abstract      = {The similarity between the distributions of spins for galaxies ($\lambda\_{\rm g}$) and for dark-matter haloes ($\lambda\_{\rm h}$), indicated both by simulations and observations, is naively interpreted as a one-to-one correlation between the spins of a galaxy and its host halo. This is used to predict galaxy sizes in semi-analytic models via $R\_{\rm e}\simeq\lambda\_{\rm h} R\_{\rm v}$, with $R\_{\rm e}$ the half-mass radius of the galaxy and $R\_{\rm v}$ the halo radius. Utilizing two different suites of zoom-in cosmological simulations, we find that $\lambda\_{\rm g}$ and $\lambda\_{\rm h}$ are in fact only barely correlated, especially at $z\geq 1$. A general smearing of this correlation is expected based on the different spin histories, where the more recently accreted baryons through streams gain and then lose significant angular momentum compared to the gradually accumulated dark matter. Expecting the spins of baryons and dark matter to be correlated at accretion into $R\_{\rm v}$, the null correlation at the end reflects an anti-correlation between $\lambda\_{\rm g}/\lambda\_{\rm h}$ and $\lambda\_{\rm h}$, which can partly arise from mergers and a compact star-forming phase that many galaxies undergo. On the other hand, the halo and galaxy spin vectors tend to be aligned, with a median $\cos\theta=0.6$-0.7 between galaxy and halo, consistent with instreaming within a preferred plane. The galaxy spin is better correlated with the spin of the inner halo, but this largely reflects the effect of the baryons on the halo. Following the null spin correlation, $\lambda\_{\rm h}$ is not a useful proxy for $R\_{\rm e}$. While our simulations reproduce a general relation of the sort $R\_{\rm e}=AR\_{\rm vir}$, in agreement with observational estimates, the relation becomes tighter with $A=0.02(c/10)^{-0.7}$, where $c$ is the halo concentration, which in turn introduces a dependence on mass and redshift.},

  abstract      = {A simple, observationally motivated model is presented for understanding how halo masses, galaxy stellar masses, and star formation rates are related, and how these relations evolve with time. The relation between halo mass and galaxy stellar mass is determined by matching the observed spatial abundance of galaxies to the expected spatial abundance of halos at multiple epochs, i.e., more massive galaxies are assigned to more massive halos at each epoch. This ``abundance matching'' technique has been shown previously to reproduce the observed luminosity and scale dependence of galaxy clustering over a range of epochs. Halos at different epochs are connected by halo mass accretion histories estimated from N-body simulations. The halo-galaxy connection at fixed epochs in conjunction with the connection between halos across time provides a connection between observed galaxies across time. With approximations for the impact of merging and accretion on the growth of galaxies, one can then directly infer the star formation histories of galaxies as a function of stellar and halo mass. This model is tuned to match both the observed evolution of the stellar mass function and the normalization of the observed star formation rate (SFR)-stellar mass relation to z \~{} 1. The data demands, for example, that the star formation rate density is dominated by galaxies with M $_{star}$ {\ap} 10$^{10.0-10.5}$ M $_{sun}$ from 0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1, and that such galaxies over these epochs reside in halos with M $_{vir}$ {\ap} 10$^{11.5-12.5}$ M $_{sun}$. The SFR-halo mass relation is approximately Gaussian over the range 0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1 with a mildly evolving mean and normalization. This model is then used to shed light on a number of issues, including (1) a clarification of ``downsizing'', (2) the lack of a sharp characteristic halo mass at which star formation is truncated, and (3) the dominance of star formation over merging to the stellar buildup of galaxies with M $_{star}$ lsim 10$^{11}$ M $_{sun}$ at z $\lt$ 1.},

  abstract      = {In a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, galaxy formation is a globally inefficient process: it is often the case that far fewer baryons are observed in galaxy disks than expected from the cosmic baryon fraction. The location of these ``missing baryons'' is unclear. By fitting halo profiles to the rotation curves of galaxies in the SPARC data set, we measure the ``missing baryon'' mass for individual late-type systems. Assuming that haloes initially accrete the cosmological baryon fraction, we show that the maximum energy available from supernovae is typically not enough to completely eject these ``missing baryons'' from a halo, but it is often sufficient to heat them to the virial temperature. The energy available from supernovae has the same scaling with galaxy mass as the energy needed to heat or eject the ``missing baryons'', indicating that the coupling efficiency of the feedback to the ISM may be constant with galaxy virial mass. We further find that the energy available from supernova feedback is always enough to convert a primordial cusp into a core and has magnitude consistent with what is required to heat the ``missing baryons'' to the virial temperature. Taking a census of the baryon content of galaxies with ${\rm 10^9\ltM\_{vir}/M\_{\odot}\lt10^{12}}$ reveals that $\sim86\\%$ of baryons are likely to be in a hot phase surrounding the galaxies and possibly observable in the X-ray, $\sim7\\%$ are in the form of cold gas, and $\sim7\\%$ are in stars.},

This is the first paper from an on-going project to address the problem with a statistical sample of galaxies outside of the Local Group (LG) without employing an assumption that the LG is a typical halo in the Universe. Thanks to the close distances of our targets, dwarf galaxies around them can be identified as extended, diffuse galaxies. By applying a surface brightness cut together with a careful visual screening to remove artifacts and background contamination, we construct a sample of dwarf galaxies. The luminosity function (LF) of one of the targets is broadly consistent with that of the MW, but the other has a more abundant dwarf population. Numerical simulations by Okamoto (2013) seem to overpredict the number of dwarfs on average, while more recent predictions from Copernicus Complexio are in a better agreement. In both observations and simulations, there is a large diversity in the LFs, demonstrating the importance of addressing the missing satellite problem with a statistically representative sample. We also characterize the projected spatial distributions of the satellites and do not observe strong evidence for alignments around the central galaxies. Based on this successful pilot observation, we are carrying out further observations to increase the sample of nearby galaxies, which we plan to report in our future paper.},

  abstract      = {We present a multi-wavelength study of NGC 4330, a highly inclined spiral galaxy in the Virgo Cluster which is a clear example of strong, ongoing intracluster medium-interstellar medium (ICM-ISM) ram pressure stripping. The H I has been removed from well within the undisturbed old stellar disk, to 50\%-65\% of R $_{25}$. Multi-wavelength data (WIYN BVR-H{$\alpha$}, Very Large Array 21 cm H I and radio continuum, and Galaxy Evolution Explorer NUV and FUV) reveal several one-sided extraplanar features likely caused by ram pressure at an intermediate disk-wind angle. At the leading edge of the interaction, the H{$\alpha$} and dust extinction curve sharply out of the disk in a remarkable and distinctive ``upturn'' feature that may be generally useful as a diagnostic indicator of active ram pressure. On the trailing side, the ISM is stretched out in a long tail which contains 10\% of the galaxy's total H I emission, 6\%-9\% of its NUV-FUV emission, but only 2\% of the H{$\alpha$}. The centroid of the H I tail is downwind of the UV/H{$\alpha$} tail, suggesting that the ICM wind has shifted most of the ISM downwind over the course of the past 10-300 Myr. Along the major axis, the disk is highly asymmetric in the UV, but more symmetric in H{$\alpha$} and H I, also implying recent changes in the distributions of gas and star formation. The UV-optical colors indicate very different star formation histories for the leading and trailing sides of the galaxy. On the leading side, a strong gradient in the UV-optical colors of the gas-stripped disk suggests that it has taken 200-400 Myr to strip the gas from a radius of $\gt$8 to 5 kpc, but on the trailing side there is no age gradient. All our data suggest a scenario in which NGC 4330 is falling into the cluster center for the first time and has experienced a significant increase in ram pressure over the last 200-400 Myr. Many of the UV-bright stars that form outside the thin disk due to ram pressure will ultimately produce stellar thick disk and halo components with characteristic morphologies and age distributions distinct from those produced by gravitational interactions.},

The Phoenix cluster is among the most massive clusters of galaxies known in the Universe. It hosts a powerful starburst of several hundreds of Solar masses per year and a large amount of molecular gas in the center. In this work we use the high-resolution Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) on board XMM-Newton to study the X-ray emitting cool gas in the Phoenix cluster and heating-cooling balance. We detect for the first time evidence of O VIII and Fe XXI-XXII emission lines, the latter demonstrating the presence of gas below 2 keV. We find a cooling rate of 350 (-200,+250) Msun/year below 2 keV (at the 90\% confidence level), which is consistent with the star formation rate in this object. This cooling rate is high enough to produce the molecular gas found in the filaments via instabilities during the buoyant rising time. The line broadening indicates that the turbulence (\~{} 300 km/s or less) is below the level required to produce and propagate the heat throughout the cool core. This provides a natural explanation to the coexistence of large amounts of cool gas, star formation and a powerful AGN in the core. The AGN activity may be either at a young stage or in a different feedback mode, due to a high accretion rate.},

  abstract      = {The site of Zn production remains an elusive and challenging problem in astrophysics. A large enhancement of the [Zn/Fe] ratios of very metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo suggests the death of short-lived massive stars, i.e., core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), as one major site for Zn production. Previous studies have claimed that some specific CCSNe can produce Zn in sufficient quantities. However, it remains unclear which models can withstand the critical test of observations. Using a Zn abundance feature similar to that of r-process elements in faint satellite galaxies, we find evidence that Zn production took place through much rarer events than canonical CCSNe. This finding can be unified with the implied decrease in the rate of Zn production with an increasing metallicity for Galactic halo stars, which narrows down the major site of Zn production in the early galaxy to magneto-rotational SNe (MR-SNe). On the other hand, in the later phase of galactic evolution, we predict that the major Zn-production site switched from MR-SNe to thermonuclear SNe (SNe Ia). According to this scenario, an accumulation of the contributions from two types of SNe eventually led to the solar isotope composition of Zn which mainly owes 66,68Zn to MR-SNe and 64Zn to SNe Ia triggered by He-detonation. The requirement of Zn production in SNe Ia sheds a new light on the hot debate on the scenario for SN Ia progenitors, suggesting that a He-detonation model might be one major channel for SNe Ia.},

Separate fits for disks and bulges alone give alpha = 0.58 +/- 0.10 and alpha = 0.83 +/- 0.16, respectively. This model correctly predicts that galaxies follow a curved 2D surface in the 3D space of j\_*, M*, and beta\_*. We find no statistically significant indication that galaxies with classical and pseudo bulges follow different relations in this space, although some differences are permitted within the observed scatter and the inherent uncertainties in decomposing galaxies into disks and bulges. As a byproduct of this analysis, we show that the j\_*--M\_* scaling relations for disk-dominated galaxies from several previous studies are in excellent agreement with each other. In addition, we resolve some conflicting claims about the beta\_*-dependence of the j\_*--M\_* scaling relations. The results presented here reinforce and extend our earlier suggestion that the distribution of galaxies with different beta\_* in the j\_*--M\_* diagram constitutes an objective, physically-motivated alternative to subjective classification schemes such as the Hubble sequence.},

  abstract      = {Super-massive black holes (SMBHs) with $M\_{\bullet} \sim 10^9 $ M$\_{\odot}$ at $z\gt6$ likely originate from massive seed black holes (BHs). We investigate the consequences of seeding SMBHs with direct collapse BHs (DCBHs) ($M\_{\bullet}=10^{4-6}\, \mathrm{M}\_\odot$) on proto-galactic disc growth. We show that even in the absence of direct feedback effects, the growth of seed BHs reduces the development of gravitational instabilities in host galaxy discs, suppressing star formation and confining stars to a narrow ring in the disc and leading to galaxies at $z \sim 6$ which lie above the local BH-stellar mass relation. The relative magnitude of cosmic and BH accretion rates governs the evolution of the BH-stellar mass relation. For typical DCBH formation epochs, $z\_{\rm{i}} \sim 10$, we find star formation is inhibited in haloes growing at the average rate predicted by $\Lambda$CDM which host BHs capable of reaching $M\_{\bullet}\sim 10^9 \, \mathrm{M}\_{\odot}$ by $z\gtrsim6$. Slower growing BHs cause a delay in the onset of star formation; a $M\_{\bullet} \sim 10^6 $ M$\_{\odot}$ seed growing at $0.25$ times the Eddington limit will delay star formation by $\sim100$ Myr. This delay is reduced by a factor of $\sim10$ if the halo growth rate is increased by $\sim 0.6\, \sigma$. Our results suggest that SMBHs seeded by DCBHs and their host galaxies form in separate progenitor haloes. In the absence of subsequent mergers, higher than average cosmic accretion or earlier seed formation ($z\_{\rm i} \sim 20$) are required to place the evolving BH on the local BH-stellar mass relation by $z=6$.},

For the stellar ingestion, we have assumed a power-law density profile for the galaxy in our framework of a new relativistic loss cone theory that includes the effect of the black hole spin.

  abstract      = {We report the detection of H$\alpha$ trails behind three new intermediate-mass irregular galaxies in the NW outskirts of the nearby cluster of galaxies Abell 1656 (Coma). Hints that these galaxies possess an extended component were found in earlier, deeper H$\alpha$ observations carried out with the Subaru telescope. However the lack of a simultaneous $r$-band exposure, together with the presence of strong stellar ghosts in the Subaru images, prevented us from quantifying the detections. We therefore devoted one full night of H$\alpha$ observation to each of the three galaxies using the San Pedro Martir 2.1m telescope. One-sided tails of H$\alpha$ emission of 10-20 kpc projected size were detected, suggesting an ongoing ram pressure stripping event. We added these 3 new sources of extended ionized gas (EIG) added to the 12 found by Yagi et al. (2010), NGC 4848 (Fossati et al. 2012), and NGC 4921 whose ram pressure stripping is certified by HI asymmetry. This brings the number sources with H$\alpha$ trails to 17 gaseous tails out of 27 (63 $\backslash$\%) late-type galaxies (LTG) galaxies members of the Coma cluster with direct evidence of ram pressure stripping. The 27 LTG galaxies, among these the 17 with extended H$\alpha$ tails, have kinematic properties that are different from the rest of the early-type galaxy (ETG) population of the c ore of the Coma cluster, as they deviate in the phase-space diagram $\Delta$V/$\sigma$ versus $r/R\_{200}$.},

We consider fixed number density galaxy samples ranked by stellar mass or star formation rate. We investigate how the clustering of haloes and their galaxy content depend on halo formation time and concentration, and how these relationships evolve with redshift. At $z=0$ the dependences of halo clustering on halo concentration and formation time are similar. However, at higher redshift, halo assembly bias weakens for haloes selected by age, and reverses and increases for haloes selected by concentration. The variation of the halo occupation with concentration and formation time is also similar at $z=0$ and changes at higher redshifts. In this case, the occupancy variation with halo age stays mostly constant with redshift but decreases for concentration. Finally, we look at the evolution of assembly bias reflected in the galaxy distribution by examining the galaxy correlation functions relative to those of shuffled galaxy samples which remove the occupancy variation. This correlation functions ratio monotonically decreases with larger redshift and for lower number density samples, going below unity in some cases, leading to reduced galaxy clustering. While the halo occupation functions themselves vary, the assembly bias trends are similar whether selecting galaxies by stellar mass or star formation rate. Our results provide further insight into the origin and evolution of assembly bias. Our extensive occupation function measurements and fits are publicly available and can be used to create realistic mock catalogues.},

The effect is observed as strong clustering of quiescent galaxies around quiescent galaxies on angular scales of {\thetas} {\le} 20 arcsec, corresponding to a proper (comoving) scale of 168 (502) kpc at z = 2. The effect is observed only for quiescent galaxies around other quiescent galaxies; the probability to find star-forming galaxies around quiescent or around star-forming ones is consistent with the clustering strength of galaxies of the same mass and at the same redshift, as observed in dedicated studies of galaxy clustering. The effect is mass dependent in the sense that the quenching probability is stronger for galaxies of smaller masses (M $_{*}$ $\lt$ 10$^{10}$ M $_{⊙}$) than for more massive ones, i.e., it follows the opposite trend with mass relative to gravitational galaxy clustering. The spatial scale where the effect is observed suggests that these environments are massive halos, in which case the observed effect would likely be satellite quenching. The effect is also redshift dependent in that the clustering strength of quiescent galaxies around other quiescent galaxies at $\backslash$bar$\{$z$\}$=1.6 is {\ap}1.7{\times} larger than that of the galaxies with the same stellar mass at $\backslash$bar$\{$z$\}$=2.6. This redshift dependence allows for a crude estimate of the timescale of environmental quenching of low-mass galaxies, which is in the range of 1.5 {\sim} 4 Gyr, in broad agreement with other estimates and with our ideas on satellite quenching.},

The primary mechanism responsible for quenching star formation in galaxies and transforming them into quiescent and passive systems is still unclear. Sudden removal of gas through outflows or stripping is one of the mechanisms often proposed. An alternative mechanism is so-called ``strangulation'', in which the supply of cold gas to the galaxy is halted. Here we report an analysis of the stellar metallicity (the fraction of elements heavier than helium in stellar atmospheres) in local galaxies, from 26,000 spectra, that clearly reveals that strangulation is the primary mechanism responsible for quenching star formation, with a typical timescale of four billion years, at least for local galaxies with a stellar mass less than 10$^{11}$ solar masses. This result is further supported independently by the stellar age difference between quiescent and star-forming galaxies, which indicates that quiescent galaxies of less than 10$^{11}$ solar masses are on average observed four billion years after quenching due to strangulation.},

  abstract      = {GW170817 was the first gravitational-wave detection of a binary neutron-star merger. It was accompanied by radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum and localized to the galaxy NGC 4993 at a distance of 40 megaparsecs. It has been proposed that the observed {$\gamma$}-ray, X-ray and radio emission is due to an ultra-relativistic jet being launched during the merger (and successfully breaking out of the surrounding material), directed away from our line of sight (off-axis). The presence of such a jet is predicted from models that posit neutron-star mergers as the drivers of short hard-{$\gamma$}-ray bursts. Here we report that the radio light curve of GW170817 has no direct signature of the afterglow of an off-axis jet. Although we cannot completely rule out the existence of a jet directed away from the line of sight, the observed {$\gamma$}-ray emission could not have originated from such a jet. Instead, the radio data require the existence of a mildly relativistic wide-angle outflow moving towards us. This outflow could be the high-velocity tail of the neutron-rich material that was ejected dynamically during the merger, or a cocoon of material that breaks out when a jet launched during the merger transfers its energy to the dynamical ejecta. Because the cocoon model explains the radio light curve of GW170817, as well as the {$\gamma$}-ray and X-ray emission (and possibly also the ultraviolet and optical emission), it is the model that is most consistent with the observational data. Cocoons may be a ubiquitous phenomenon produced in neutron-star mergers, giving rise to a hitherto unidentified population of radio, ultraviolet, X-ray and {$\gamma$}-ray transients in the local Universe.},

Using observations of 91 star-forming and quiescent central galaxies with directly measured black hole masses, we find that quiescent galaxies host more massive black holes than star-forming galaxies with similar stellar masses. This observational result is in qualitative agreement with models that assume that effective, more-or-less continuous active galactic nucleus feedback suppresses star formation, strongly suggesting the importance of the black hole in producing quiescence in central galaxies.},

In this model, quenching is the dominant physical mechanism for introducing scatter in the growth histories of these galaxies. We find that present-day quiescent galaxies have a larger variety of growth histories than star-formers since they underwent `staggered quenching' - a term describing the correlation between the time of quenching and present-day halo mass. While halo mass correlates broadly with quiescence, we find that quiescence is primarily a function of black hole mass, where galaxies quench when heating from their active galactic nuclei becomes sufficient to offset the redshift-dependent cooling rate. In this model, the emergence of a prominent quiescent population is the main process that flattens the stellar mass-halo mass relation at mass scales at or above that of the Milky Way.},

In order to explain this relation, we propose a physical framework where the gradual suppression of a galaxy{\rsquo}s star formation activity results from the adjustment to an increase in specific black hole mass, and accordingly, an increase in the amount of heating. From this framework, it follows that at least some galaxies with intermediate specific black hole masses are in a steady state of partial quiescence with intermediate specific SFRs, implying that both transitioning and steady-state galaxies live within this region that is known as the {\ldquo}green valley.{\rdquo} With respect to galaxy formation models, our results present an important diagnostic with which to test various prescriptions of black hole feedback and its effects on star formation activity.},

  abstract      = {We study the dependence of star-formation quenching on galaxy mass and environment, in the SDSS (z\~{}0.1) and the AEGIS (z\~{}1). It is crucial that we define quenching by low star-formation rate rather than by red colour, given that one third of the red galaxies are star forming. We address stellar mass M*, halo mass Mh, density over the nearest N neighbours deltaN, and distance to the halo centre D. The fraction of quenched galaxies appears more strongly correlated with Mh at fixed M* than with M* at fixed Mh, while for satellites quenching also depends on D. We present the M*-Mh relation for centrals at z\~{}1. At z\~{}1, the dependence of quenching on M* at fixed Mh is somewhat more pronounced than at z\~{}0, but the quenched fraction is low (10\%) and the haloes are less massive. For satellites, M*-dependent quenching is noticeable at high D, suggesting a quenching dependence on sub-halo mass for recently captured satellites. At small D, where satellites likely fell in more than a few Gyr ago, quenching strongly depends on Mh, and not on M*. The Mh-dependence of quenching is consistent with theoretical wisdom where virial shock heating in massive haloes shuts down accretion and triggers ram-pressure stripping, causing quenching. The interpretation of deltaN is complicated by the fact that it depends on the number of observed group members compared to N, motivating the use of D as a better measure of local environment.},

  abstract      = {We examine the quenched fraction of central and satellite galaxies as a function of galaxy stellar mass, halo mass, and the matter density of their large-scale environment. Matter densities are inferred from our ELUCID simulation, a constrained simulation of the local universe sampled by SDSS, while halo masses and central/satellite classification are taken from the galaxy group catalog of Yang et al. The quenched fraction for the total population increases systematically with the three quantities. We find that the {\ldquo}environmental quenching efficiency,{\rdquo} which quantifies the quenched fraction as a function of halo mass, is independent of stellar mass. And this independence is the origin of the stellar mass independence of density-based quenching efficiency found in previous studies. Considering centrals and satellites separately, we find that the two populations follow similar correlations of quenching efficiency with halo mass and stellar mass, suggesting that they have experienced similar quenching processes in their host halo. We demonstrate that satellite quenching alone cannot account for the environmental quenching efficiency of the total galaxy population, and that the difference between the two populations found previously arises mainly from the fact that centrals and satellites of the same stellar mass reside, on average, in halos of different mass. After removing these effects of halo mass and stellar mass, there remains a weak, but significant, residual dependence on environmental density, which is eliminated when halo assembly bias is taken into account. Our results therefore indicate that halo mass is the prime environmental parameter that regulates the quenching of both centrals and satellites.},

  abstract      = {Using data from the COSMOS survey, we perform the first joint analysis of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, galaxy spatial clustering, and galaxy number densities. Carefully accounting for sample variance and for scatter between stellar and halo mass, we model all three observables simultaneously using a novel and self-consistent theoretical framework. Our results provide strong constraints on the shape and redshift evolution of the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) from z = 0.2 to z = 1. At low stellar mass, we find that halo mass scales as M$_{h}$ vpropM $^{0.46}$ $_{*}$ and that this scaling does not evolve significantly with redshift from z = 0.2 to z = 1. The slope of the SHMR rises sharply at M $_{*}$ $\gt$ 5 {\times} 10$^{10}$ M $_{⊙}$ and as a consequence, the stellar mass of a central galaxy becomes a poor tracer of its parent halo mass. We show that the dark-to-stellar ratio, M$_{h}$ /M $_{*}$, varies from low to high masses, reaching a minimum of M$_{h}$ /M $_{*}$ \~{} 27 at M $_{*}$ = 4.5 {\times} 10$^{10}$ M $_{⊙}$ and M$_{h}$ = 1.2 {\times} 10$^{12}$ M $_{⊙}$. This minimum is important for models of galaxy formation because it marks the mass at which the accumulated stellar growth of the central galaxy has been the most efficient. We describe the SHMR at this minimum in terms of the ``pivot stellar mass,'' M $^{piv}$ $_{*}$, the ``pivot halo mass,'' M $^{piv}$ $_{ h }$, and the ``pivot ratio,'' (M$_{h}$ /M $_{*}$)$^{piv}$. Thanks to a homogeneous analysis of a single data set spanning a large redshift range, we report the first detection of mass downsizing trends for both M $^{piv}$ $_{ h }$ and M $^{piv}$ $_{*}$. The pivot stellar mass decreases from M $^{piv}$ $_{*}$ = 5.75 {\plusmn} 0.13 {\times} 10$^{10}$ M $_{⊙}$ at z = 0.88 to M $^{piv}$ $_{*}$ = 3.55 {\plusmn} 0.17 {\times} 10$^{10}$ M $_{⊙}$ at z = 0.37. Intriguingly, however, the corresponding evolution of M $^{piv}$ $_{ h }$ leaves the pivot ratio constant with redshift at (M$_{h}$ /M $_{*}$)$^{piv}$ \~{} 27. We use simple arguments to show how this result raises the possibility that star formation quenching may ultimately depend on M$_{h}$ /M $_{*}$ and not simply on M$_{h}$ , as is commonly assumed. We show that simple models with such a dependence naturally lead to downsizing in the sites of star formation. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in the context of popular quenching models, including disk instabilities and active galactic nucleus feedback.

We also report halo mass accretion rates and concentrations. We show that the higher cosmological matter density of the Planck parameters compared with the WMAP parameters leads to higher abundance of massive haloes at high redshifts. We find that the median halo spin parameter $\{${$\lambda$} \_B$\}$= J({\surd}$\{$2$\}$M\_virR\_virV\_vir)\^{}$\{$-1$\}$ is nearly independent of redshift, leading to predicted evolution of galaxy sizes that is consistent with observations, while the significant decrease with redshift in median $\{${$\lambda$} \_P$\}$= J|E|\^{}$\{$-1/2$\}$G\^{}$\{$-1$\}$M\^{}$\{$-5/2$\}$ predicts more decrease in galaxy sizes than is observed. Using the Tully-Fisher and Faber-Jackson relations between galaxy velocity and mass, we show that a simple model of how galaxy velocity is related to halo maximum circular velocity leads to increasing overprediction of cosmic stellar mass density as redshift increases beyond z {\tilde} 1, implying that such velocity-mass relations must change at z {\gsim} 1. By making a realistic model of how observed galaxy velocities are related to halo circular velocity, we show that recent optical and radio observations of the abundance of galaxies are in good agreement with our {$\Lambda$}CDM simulations. Our halo demographics are based on updated versions of the ROCKSTAR and CONSISTENT TREES codes, and this paper includes appendices explaining all of their outputs. This paper is an introduction to a series of related papers presenting other analyses of the Bolshoi-Planck and MultiDark-Planck simulations.},

  abstract      = {We study the global and radial stellar mass assembly of eight zoomed-in Milky Way (MW)-sized galaxies produced in hydrodynamics cosmological simulations. The disk-dominated galaxies (four) show a fast initial stellar mass growth in the innermost parts, driven mostly by in situ star formation (SF), but since z {\tilde} 2-1, the SF has entered a long-term quenching phase. The outer regions follow this trend but more gently, as they are more external. As a result, the radial stellar mass growth is highly inside-out due to both inside-out structural growth and inside-out SF quenching. The half-mass radius evolves fast; for instance, $\{$R$\}$$_{0.5}$(z = 1) $\lt$ 0.5 $\{$R$\}$$_{0.5}$ (z = 0). Two other runs resemble lenticular galaxies. One also shows a pronounced inside-out growth, and the other one presents a nearly uniform radial mass assembly. The other two galaxies suffered late major mergers. Their normalized radial mass growth histories (MGHs) are very close, but with periods of outside-in assembly during or after the mergers. For all of the simulations, the archaeological radial MGHs calculated from the z = 0 stellar particle age distribution are similar to current MGHs, which shows that the mass assembly by ex situ stars and the radial mass transport do not significantly change their radial mass distributions. Our results agree qualitatively with observational inferences from the fossil record method applied to a survey of local galaxies and from look-back observations of progenitors of MW-sized galaxies. However, the inside-out growth mode is more pronounced, and the $\{$R$\}$$_{0.5}$ growth is faster in simulations than in observational inferences.},

  abstract      = {We present a new model to describe the galaxy-dark matter connection across cosmic time, which unlike the popular subhalo abundance-matching technique is self-consistent in that it takes account of the facts that (1) subhalos are accreted at different times and (2) the properties of satellite galaxies may evolve after accretion. Using observations of galaxy stellar mass functions (SMFs) out to z \~{} 4, the conditional SMF at z \~{} 0.1 obtained from Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxy group catalogs, and the two-point correlation function (2PCF) of galaxies at z \~{} 0.1 as a function of stellar mass, we constrain the relation between galaxies and dark matter halos over the entire cosmic history from z \~{} 4 to the present. This relation is then used to predict the median assembly histories of different stellar mass components within dark matter halos (central galaxies, satellite galaxies, and halo stars). We also make predictions for the 2PCFs of high-z galaxies as function of stellar mass. Our main findings are the following: (1) Our model reasonably fits all data within the observational uncertainties, indicating that the {$\Lambda$}CDM concordance cosmology is consistent with a wide variety of data regarding the galaxy population across cosmic time. (2) At low-z, the stellar mass of central galaxies increases with halo mass as M $^{0.3}$ and M $^{gsim 4.0}$ at the massive and low-mass ends, respectively. The ratio M $_{*, c }$/M reveals a maximum of \~{}0.03 at a halo mass M \~{} 10$^{11.8}$ h $^{-1}$ M $_{⊙}$, much lower than the universal baryon fraction (\~{}0.17). At higher redshifts the maximum in M $_{*, c }$/M remains close to \~{}0.03, but shifts to higher halo mass. (3) The inferred timescale for the disruption of satellite galaxies is about the same as the dynamical friction timescale of their subhalos. (4) The stellar mass assembly history of central galaxies is completely decoupled from the assembly history of its host halo; the ratio M $_{*, c }$/M initially increases rapidly with time until the halo mass reaches \~{}10$^{12}$ h $^{-1}$ M $_{⊙}$, at which point M $_{*, c }$/M \~{} 0.03. Once M $\gt$\~{} 10$^{12}$ h $^{-1}$ M $_{⊙}$, there is little growth in M $_{*, c }$, causing the ratio M $_{*, c }$/M to decline. In Milky Way (MW)-sized halos more than half of the central stellar mass is assembled at z $\lt$\~{} 0.5. (5) In low-mass halos, the accretion of satellite galaxies contributes little to the formation of their central galaxies, indicating that most of their stars must have formed in situ. In massive halos more than half of the stellar mass of the central galaxy has to be formed in situ, and the accretion of satellites can only become significant at z $\lt$\~{} 2. (6) The total mass in halo stars is more than twice that of the central galaxy in massive halos, but less than 10\% of M $_{*, c }$ in MW-sized halos. (7) The 2PCFs of galaxies on small scales hold important information regarding the evolution of satellite galaxies, which at high-z is predicted to be much steeper than at low-z, especially for more massive galaxies. We discuss various implications of our findings regarding the formation and evolution of galaxies in a {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology.},

  abstract      = {Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxy group catalogue of Yang et al. (2007), we study the average colour and average concentration of satellite galaxies as function of (i) their stellar mass, (ii) their group mass, and (iii) their group-centric radius. We find that the colours and concentrations of satellite galaxies are (almost) completely determined by their stellar mass. In particular, at fixed stellar mass, the average colours and concentrations of satellite galaxies are independent of either halo mass or halo-centric radius. We find clear evidence for mass segregation of satellite galaxies in haloes of all masses, and argue that this explains why satellites at smaller halo-centric radii are somewhat redder and somewhat more concentrated. In addition, the weak colour and concentration dependence of satellite galaxies on halo mass is simply a reflection of the fact that more massive haloes host, on average, more massive satellites. Combining these results with the fact that satellite galaxies are, on average, redder and somewhat more concentrated than central galaxies of the same stellar mass, the following picture emerges: galaxies become redder and somewhat more concentrated once they fall into a bigger halo (i.e., once they become a satellite galaxy). This is a clear manifestation of environment dependence. However, there is no indication that the magnitude of the transformation (or its timescale) depends on environment; a galaxy undergoes a transition when it becomes a satellite, but it does not matter whether it becomes a satellite of a small (Milky Way sized) halo, or of a massive cluster. We discuss the implication of this `dearth' of environment dependence for the physical processes responsible for transforming satellite galaxies.},

Cooling can be regulated by feedback from accretion of cooling gas onto the central black hole, but requires an accretion rate finely tuned to the thermodynamic state of the hot gas. Theoretical models in which cold clouds precipitate out of the hot gas via thermal instability and accrete onto the black hole exhibit the necessary tuning. Recent observational evidence shows that the abundance of cold gas in the centres of clusters increases rapidly near the predicted threshold for instability. Here we report observations showing that this precipitation threshold extends over a large range in cluster radius, cluster mass and cosmic time. We incorporate the precipitation threshold into a framework of theoretical models for the thermodynamic state of hot gas in galaxy clusters. According to that framework, precipitation regulates star formation in some giant galaxies, while thermal conduction prevents star formation in others if it can compensate for radiative cooling and shut off precipitation.},

Color fractions depend on mass and only for M $_{*}$ $\lt$ 10$^{10.7}$ M $_{⊙}$ on environment. The incidence of red galaxies increases with increasing mass, and, for M $_{*}$ $\lt$ 10$^{10.7}$ M $_{⊙}$, decreases toward the group outskirts and in binary and single galaxies. The relative abundance of green and blue galaxies is independent of environment and increases monotonically with galaxy mass. We also inspect galaxy structural parameters, star-formation properties, histories, and ages and propose an evolutionary scenario for the different subpopulations. Color transformations are due to a reduction and suppression of the star-formation rate in both bulges and disks that does not noticeably affect galaxy structure. Morphological transitions are linked to an enhanced bulge-to-disk ratio that is due to the removal of the disk, not to an increase of the bulge. Our modeling suggests that green colors might be due to star-formation histories declining with long timescales, as an alternative scenario to the classical ``quenching'' processes. Our results suggest that galaxy transformations in star-formation activity and morphology depend neither on the environment nor on being a satellite or the most massive galaxy of a halo. The only environmental dependence we find is the higher fast quenching efficiency in groups giving origin to poststarburst signatures.},

The SFR-M$\_*$ correlations obtained using the two approaches are found to be consistent with each other through a KS test. Validation tests using SFHs from semi-analytic models and cosmological hydrodynamical simulations confirm the sensitivity of the method to changes in the slope, normalization and shape of the SFR-M$\_*$ correlation. This technique allows us to further probe the low-mass regime of the correlation at high-z by $\sim 1$ dex and over an effective volume of $\sim 10\times$ larger than possible with just direct fits. We find that the SFR-M$\_*$ correlation is consistent with being linear down to M$\_*\sim 10^7 M\_\odot$ at $z\gt4$. The evolution of the correlation is well described by $\log SFR= (0.80\pm 0.029 - 0.017\pm 0.010\times t\_{univ})\log M\_*$ $- (6.487\pm 0.282-0.039\pm 0.008\times t\_{univ})$, where $t\_{univ}$ is the age of the universe in Gyr.},

  abstract      = {We study the origin and cosmic evolution of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) in star-forming galaxies based on a full, numerical chemical evolution model. The model was designed to match the local MZRs for both gas and stars simultaneously. This is achieved by invoking a time-dependent metal enrichment process which assumes either a time-dependent metal outflow with larger metal loading factors in galactic winds at early times, or a time-dependent Initial Mass Function (IMF) with steeper slopes at early times. We compare the predictions from this model with data sets covering redshifts 0$\lt$z$\lt$3.5. The data suggests a two-phase evolution with a transition point around z \~{} 1.5. Before that epoch the MZRgas has been evolving parallel with no evolution in the slope. After z \~{} 1.5 the MZRgas started flattening until today. We show that the predictions of both the variable metal outflow and the variable IMF model match these observations very well. Our model also reproduces the evolution of the main sequence, hence the correlation between galaxy mass and star formation rate. We also compare the predicted redshift evolution of the MZRstar with data from the literature. As the latter mostly contains data of massive, quenched early-type galaxies, stellar metallicities at high redshifts tend to be higher in the data than predicted by our model. Data of stellar metallicities of lower-mass ($\lt$ 10\^{}11 solar mass), star-forming galaxies at high redshift is required to test our model.},

  abstract      = {Exploiting a sample of 680 star-forming galaxies from the Padova-Millennium GalaxyGroup Catalog (PM2GC) (Calvi et al. 2011) in the range 0.038$\lt$z$\lt$0.104, we present a detailed analysis of the Star Formation Rate (SFR)-stellar mass (M\_star) and specific SFR(SSFR)-M\_star relations as a function of environment. We adopt three different parameterizations of environment, to probe different scales. We consider separately 1) galaxies in groups, binary and single systems, defined in terms of a Friends-of-Friends algorithm, 2) galaxies located at different projected local densities, 3) galaxies in haloes of different mass. Overall, above logM\_ast/M\_sun$\gt$10.25 and SSFR$\gt$10\^{}$\{$-12$\}$ yr\^{}$\{$-1$\}$, the SFR-M\_ast and SSFR-M\_ast relations do not depend on environment, when the global environment is used, while when the halo mass is considered, high mass haloes might have a systematically lower (S)SFR-M\_ast relation. Finally, when local densities are exploited, at any given mass galaxies in less dense environments have systematically higher values of SFR. All the relations are characterized by a large scatter ($\{$$\backslash$sigma$\}$\~{}0.6), which is dueto the coexistence of galaxies of different morphological types. Indeed, at any given mass, late-types are characterized by systematically higher values of SFR and SSFR than S0s and ellipticals. Galaxies of the same morphology show similar trends in all the environments, but their incidence strongly depends on environment and on the environmental parametrization adopted, with late-types generally becoming less common in denser environments, contrasted by the increase of ellipticals and/or S0s. Our results suggest that in the local universe morphology and local interactions, probed by the local density parameterization, have dominant roles in driving the characteristics of the SFR-M\_ast relation.},

  abstract      = {Mergers of galaxies are an important mode for galaxy evolution because they serve as an efficient trigger of powerful starbursts. However, observational studies of the molecular gas properties during their early stages are scarce. We present interferometric CO(2-1) maps of two luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs), NGC 3110 and NGC 232, obtained with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) with \~{} 1 kpc resolution. While NGC 3110 is a spiral galaxy interacting with a minor (14:1 stellar mass) companion, NGC 232 is interacting with a similarly sized object. We find that such interactions have likely induced in these galaxies enhancements in the molecular gas content and central concentrations, partly at the expense of atomic gas. The obtained molecular gas surface densities in their circumnuclear regions are $\Sigma\_{\rm mol}~\gtrsim10^{2.5}$ M$\_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$, higher than in non-interacting objects by an order of magnitude. Gas depletion times of \~{} 0.5 - 1 Gyr are found for the different regions, lying in between non-interacting disk galaxies and the starburst sequence. In the case of NGC 3110, the spiral arms show on average 0.5 dex shorter depletion times than in the circumnuclear regions if we assume a similar H$\_2$-CO conversion factor. We show that even in the early stages of the interaction with a minor companion, a starburst is formed along the circumnuclear region and spiral arms, where a large population of SSCs is found (\~{}350), and at the same time a large central gas concentration is building up which might be the fuel for an active galactic nucleus. The main morphological properties of the NGC 3110 system are reproduced by our numerical simulations and allow us to estimate that the current epoch of the interaction is at \~{} 150 Myrs after closest approach.},

  abstract      = {The stellar initial mass function (IMF) is commonly assumed to be an invariant probability density distribution function of initial stellar masses being represented by the canonical IMF. As a consequence the galaxy-wide IMF (gwIMF), defined as the sum of the IMFs of all star forming regions, should also be invariant. Recent observational and theoretical results challenge the hypothesis that the gwIMF is invariant. In order to study the possible reasons for this variation we use the IMF determined in resolved star clusters and apply the IGIMF-theory to calculate a grid of gwIMF models for metallicities, -3$\lt$[Fe/H]$\lt$1, and galaxy-wide star formation rates, $10^{-5}$$\lt$SFR$\lt$$10^{5}\,\mathrm{M\_{\odot}/yr}$. For a galaxy with metallicy [Fe/H]$\lt0$ and SFR$\,\gt 1\,M\_\odot$/yr, which is a common condition in the early Universe, we find that the gwIMF is top-heavy (more massive stars), when compared to the canonical IMF. For a SFR $\lt 1\,\mathrm{M\_{\odot}/yr}$ the gwIMF becomes top-light regardless of the metallicity. For metallicities $\mathrm{[Fe/H]} \gt 0$ the gwIMF can become bottom-heavy regardless of the SFR. The IGIMF models predict that massive elliptical galaxies should have formed with a gwIMF that is top-heavy within the first few hundred Myr of the galaxy's life and that it evolves into a bottom-heavy gwIMF in the metal-enriched galactic center. We study the SFR$-$H$\alpha$ relation, its dependency on metallicity and the SFR, the correction factors to the Kennicutt SFR$\_{\rm K}-$H$\alpha$ relation, and provide new fitting functions Late-type dwarf galaxies show significantly higher SFRs with respect to Kennicutt SFRs, while star forming massive galaxies have significantly lower SFRs than hitherto thought. This has implications for the gas-consumption time scales and for the main sequence of galaxies. The Leo P and ultra-faint dwarf galaxies are discussed explicitly. [abridged]},

  abstract      = {We discuss new constraints on the epoch of cosmic reionization and test the assumption that most of the ionizing photons responsible arose from high-redshift star-forming galaxies. Good progress has been made in charting the end of reionization through spectroscopic studies of z {\sime}  6-8 QSOs, gamma-ray bursts, and galaxies expected to host Ly{$\alpha$} emission. However, the most stringent constraints on its duration have come from the integrated optical depth, {$\tau$}, of Thomson scattering to the cosmic microwave background. Using the latest data on the abundance and luminosity distribution of distant galaxies from Hubble Space Telescope imaging, we simultaneously match the reduced value {$\tau$} =0.066+/- 0.012 recently reported by the Planck collaboration and the evolving neutrality of the intergalactic medium with a reionization history within 6{\lsim} z{\lsim} 10, thereby reducing the requirement for a significant population of very high redshift (z$\backslash$gg 10) galaxies. Our analysis strengthens the conclusion that star-forming galaxies dominated the reionization process and has important implications for upcoming 21 cm experiments and searches for early galaxies with the James Webb Space Telescope.},
