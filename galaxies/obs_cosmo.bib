These candidates were selected by a combination of double component fitting, morphological assessment and color analysis. Most systems followed up are indeed composed of at least one quasar image and 13 with two or more quasar images: two lenses, four projected binaries and seven Nearly Identical Quasar Pairs (NIQs). The two systems confirmed as genuine gravitationally lensed quasars are one quadruple at $z\_s=1.713$ and one double at $z\_s=1.515$. Lens modeling of these two systems reveals that both systems require very little contribution from the environment to reproduce the image configuration. Nevertheless, small flux anomalies can be observed in one of the images of the quad. Further observations of 9 inconclusive systems (including 7 NIQs) will allow to confirm (or not) their gravitational lens nature.},

Systematic searches are revealing more candidates, but this process could be accelerated by predictions from simulations. We perform a study of several high-resolution, cosmological, zoom-in simulations focusing on dwarf galaxies that host massive black holes at z = 0, with the aim of determining when the black holes are most observable. Larger dwarf galaxies are more likely to host MBHs than those of lower mass. About 50\% of the MBHs in dwarfs are not centrally located, but rather are wandering within a few kpc of the galaxy center. The accretion luminosities of MBHs in dwarfs are low throughout cosmic time, rendering them extremely difficult to detect. However, the merger history of these MBHs is optimal for gravitational wave detection by LISA.},

We find good agreement with a range of recent models within the HST field of view. We present a map of the ratio of projected stellar mass to total mass ($f\_{\star}$), and find that the stellar mass fraction for this cluster peaks on the primary BCG. Averaging within a radius of 0.3 Mpc, we obtain a value of $\langle f\_{\star} \rangle = 0.012^{+0.004}\_{-0.003}$, consistent with other recent results for this ratio in cluster environments, though with a large global error (up to $\delta f\_{\star} = 0.005$) primarily due to the choice of an IMF. We compare values of $f\_{\star}$ and measures of star formation efficiency for this cluster to other Hubble Frontier Fields clusters studied in the literature, finding that MACS1149 has a higher stellar mass fraction than these other clusters, but a star formation efficiency typical of massive clusters.},

  abstract      = {Recently, van Dokkum et. al. have presented an important discovery of an ultra diffuse galaxy, NGC1052-DF2, with a dark matter content significantly less than predicted from its stellar mass alone. The analysis relies on measured radial velocities of 10 ``Globular Clusters'' (GCs), of estimated individual masses of a few $ \times 10^6 M\_\odot$. This is about $1\\%$ the inferred mass of NGC1052-DF2 of $2\times 10^8 M\_\odot$ within a half-light radius, $R\_e=2.2 \mathrm{kpc} $. The large relative mass and the old age of these objects imply that they might be susceptible to orbital decay by dynamical friction. Using analytic estimates and N-body simulations of an isolated system matching the inferred mass profile of NGC1052-DF2, we show that orbits of the most massive GCs should already have decayed on a time scale of a few Gyrs. This implies that either the masses of the GCs are overestimated or that the mass of NGC1052-DF2 is underestimated by an order of magnitude or so.},

Stellar evolution recipes crucially affect the remnant mass distribution, suggesting that future efforts should be devoted to finding a common way of modelling the evolutionary phases of single and binary stars. Our simple approach allowed us to constrain the origin of the presently observed population of merged BHs, although with high uncertainties.

The angular spectrum of the anisotropies, quantified by the $C\_\ell$ components, is calculated using two complementary approaches: (i) a simple, closed-form analytical expression, and (ii) a detailed numerical study using an all-sky mock lightcone galaxy catalogue from the Millennium simulation. The two approaches are in excellent agreement at large angular scales, and differ by a factor of order unity at smaller scales. These anisotropies are considerably larger in amplitude than e.g. those in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), confirming that it is important to model these anisotropies, and indicating that this is a promising avenue for future theoretical and observational work.},

  title       = {Black hole mergers from an evolving population of globular clusters},
  abstract    = {The high rate of black hole (BH) mergers detected by LIGO/VIRGO opened questions on their astrophysical origin. One possibility is the dynamical channel, in which binary formation and hardening is catalyzed by dynamical encounters in globular clusters (GCs). Previous studies have shown that the BH merger rate from the present day GC density in the Universe is lower than the observed rate. In this Letter, we study the BH merger rate by accounting for the first time for the evolution of GCs within their host galaxies. The mass in GCs was initially $\sim 8\times$ higher, which decreased to its present value due to evaporation and tidal disruption. Many BH binaries that were ejected long before their merger, originated in GCs that no longer exist. We find that the comoving merger rate in the dynamical channel from GCs varies between $15$ to $100\,{\rm Gpc}^{-3}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ between redshift $z=0.5$ to $2$, and the total rate is $1$, $5$, $30$ events per day within $z=0.5$, $1$, and $2$, respectively. Gravitational Wave detector networks offer an unique observational probe of the initial number of GC populations and their subsequent evolution across cosmic time.},

  abstract    = {The gravitational-wave background from supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs) has yet to be detected. This has led to speculations as to whether current pulsar timing array limits are in tension with theoretical predictions. In this paper, we use electromagnetic observations to constrain the SMBBH background from above and below. To derive the maximum amplitude of the background, we suppose that all known supermassive black holes are the result of equal-mass mergers. This yields a maximum characteristic signal amplitude at a period of one year $A_{\rm{yr}}<1.8\times 10^{-15}$, which is comparable to the pulsar timing limits. To derive the {\em minimum} amplitude requires an electromagnetic observation of a SMBBH. While a number of candidates have been put forward, there are no universally-accepted electromagnetic detections in the nanohertz band. We show the candidate 3C 66B implies a lower limit, which is inconsistent with limits from pulsar timing, casting doubt on its binary nature. Alternatively, if the parameters of OJ 287 are known accurately, then $A_{\rm{yr}}> 6.1\times 10^{-17}$ at 95% confidence level. If one of the current candidates can be established as a bona fide SMBBH, it will immediately imply an astrophysically interesting lower limit.},

We investigate the cosmic merger rate of double neutron stars (DNSs), neutron star-black hole binaries (NSBHs) and black hole binaries (BHBs) by means of population-synthesis simulations coupled with the Illustris cosmological simulation. We have performed six different simulations, considering different assumptions for the efficiency of common envelope (CE) ejection and exploring two distributions for the supernova (SN) kicks. The current BHB merger rate derived from our simulations spans from $\sim{}150$ to $\sim{}240$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ and is only mildly dependent on CE efficiency. In contrast, the current merger rates of DNSs (ranging from $\sim{}20$ to $\sim{}600$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$) and NSBHs (ranging from $\sim{}10$ to $\sim{}100$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$) strongly depend on the assumptions on CE and natal kicks. The merger rate of DNSs is consistent with the one inferred from the detection of GW170817 only if a high efficiency of CE ejection and low SN kicks (drawn from a Maxwellian distribution with one dimensional root mean square $\sigma{}=15$ km s$^{-1}$) are assumed.},

  abstract      = {Recent research has been constraining the retention fraction of black holes (BHs) in globular clusters by comparing the degree of mass segregation with $N$-body simulations. They are consistent with an upper limit of the retention fraction being $50\,\\%$ or less. In this work, we focus on direct simulations of the dynamics of BHs in star clusters. We aim to constrain the effective distribution of natal kicks that BHs receive during supernova (SN) explosions and to estimate the BH retention fraction. We used the collisional $N$-body code nbody6 to measure the retention fraction of BHs for a given set of parameters, which are: the initial mass of a star cluster, the initial half-mass radius, and $\sigma\_\mathrm{BH}$, which sets the effective Maxwellian BH velocity kick distribution. We compare these direct $N$-body models with our analytic estimates and newest observational constraints. The numerical simulations show that for the one-dimensional (1D) velocity kick dispersion $\sigma\_\mathrm{BH} \lt 50\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, clusters with radii of 2 pc and that are initially more massive than $5 \times 10^3\,M\_\odot$ retain more than $20\,\\%$ of BHs within their half-mass radii. Our simple analytic model yields a number of retained BHs that is in good agreement with the $N$-body models. Furthermore, the analytic estimates show that ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) should have retained more than $80\,\\%$ of their BHs for $\sigma\_\mathrm{BH} \leq 190\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Although our models do not contain primordial binaries, in the most compact clusters with $10^3$ stars, we have found evidence of delayed SN explosions producing a surplus of BHs compared to the IMF due to dynamically formed binary stars. These cases do not occur in the more populous or expanded clusters.},

The vector dark matter in the hidden sector does not directly couple to the visible sector, but instead annihilates into the hidden Higgs bosons which decay through a small coupling into the CP-odd Higgs bosons. In this model, the Galactic center gamma-ray excess is mainly due to the 2-step cascade annihilation with $\tau$'s in the final state. The obtained mass of the CP-odd Higgs $A$ in the Galactic center excess fit can explain the muon $g-2$ anomaly at the 2$\sigma$ level without violating the stringent constraints from the lepton universality and $\tau$ decays. We show three different freeze-out types of the dark matter relic, called (i) the conventional WIMP dark matter, (ii) the unconventional WIMP dark matter and (iii) the co-decaying dark matter, depending on the magnitudes of the mixing angles between the hidden Higgs and visible two-Higgs doublets. The dark matter in the hidden sector is secluded from detections in the direct searches or colliders, while the dark matter annihilation signals are not suppressed in a general hidden sector dark matter model.

  abstract      = {The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate. As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them. Here, we consider the likely response of a highly advanced civilization to this situation. In particular, we argue that in order to maximize its access to useable energy, a sufficiently advanced civilization would chose to expand rapidly outward, build Dyson Spheres or similar structures around encountered stars, and use the energy that is harnessed to accelerate those stars away from the approaching horizon and toward the center of the civilization. We find that such efforts will be most effective for stars with masses in the range of $M\sim (0.2-1) M\_{\odot}$, and could lead to the harvesting of stars within a region extending out to several tens of Mpc in radius, potentially increasing the total amount of energy that is available to a future civilization by a factor of several thousand. We also discuss the observable signatures of a civilization elsewhere in the universe that is currently in this state of stellar harvesting.},

When the accretion rate is relatively high, the circumbinary disk, accretion streams, and mini-disks combine to emit light in the UV/EUV bands. We posit a thermal Compton hard X-ray spectrum for coronal emission; at high accretion rates, it is almost entirely produced in the mini-disks, but at lower accretion rates it is the primary radiation mechanism in the mini-disks and accretion streams as well. Due to relativistic beaming and gravitational lensing, the angular distribution of the power radiated is strongly anisotropic, especially near the equatorial plane.},

Previous strong tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates were all associated with the centers of largely isolated galaxies. Here we report the discovery of a luminous X-ray outburst from a massive star cluster at a projected distance of 12.5 kpc from the center of a large lenticular galaxy. The luminosity peaked at \~{}10\^{}$\{$43$\}$ erg/s and decayed systematically over 10 years, approximately following a trend that supports the identification of the event as a TDE. The X-ray spectra were all very soft, with emission confined to be $\lt$3.0 keV, and could be described with a standard thermal disk. The disk cooled significantly as the luminosity decreased, a key thermal-state signature often observed in accreting stellar-mass black holes. This thermal-state signature, coupled with very high luminosities, ultrasoft X-ray spectra and the characteristic power-law evolution of the light curve, provides strong evidence that the source contains an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) with a mass of a few ten thousand solar mass. This event demonstrates that one of the most effective means to detect IMBHs is through X-ray flares from TDEs in star clusters.},

  abstract      = {Close binaries of supermassive black holes (CB-SMBHs) with separations of $\lesssim 0.1$pc as the final stage of galaxy mergers are sources of low frequency gravitational waves (GW), however, they are still elusive observationally because they are not spatially resolved. Fortunately, reverberation as echoes of broad emission lines to ionizing continuum conveys invaluable information of the dynamics of broad-line regions (BLRs) governed by supermassive black holes in the central regions of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In this paper, we demonstrate how to composite the hybrid 2-dimensional transfer functions of binary BLRs around the CB-SMBHs in AGNs, providing an opportunity of identifying them from reverberation mapping (RM) data. It is found that there are variation-coupling effects in the transfer functions, arising from the coupling of CB-SMBH light curves in the Fourier space. We provide semi-analytical formulations of the transfer functions for kinematic maps of the gas. For cases with the simplest variation-coupling effects, we make calculations for several BLR models and reveal significant distinctions from those of single active black holes. In principle, the difference is caused by the orbital motion of the CB-SMBH systems. In order to search for CB-SMBHs in time-domain space, selection of target candidates should focus on local AGNs with H$\beta$ double-peaked profiles and weaker near-infrared emission. High-fidelity RM-campaigns of monitoring the targets in future will provide opportunities to reveal these kinematic signatures of the CB-SMBHs and hence for measurements of their orbital parameters.},

This suggests that the observed phenomenon can be caused by different ``central engines'' or that the engine produces a variety of outcomes depending on the specific system parameters, or possibly both. The most popular engine scenario, the merger of two neutron stars, has received support from the recent Fermi and INTEGRAL detection of a burst of gamma rays (GRB170817A) following the neutron star merger GW170817, but at the moment it is not clear how peculiar this event potentially was. Several sGRBs engine models involve the collapse of a supramassive neutron star that produces a black hole plus an accretion disk. We study this scenario for a variety of equations of states both via angular momentum considerations based on equilibrium models and via fully dynamical Numerical Relativity simulations. We obtain a broader range of disk forming configurations than earlier studies but, in agreement with the latter, we find that none of these configurations is likely to produce a phenomenon that would be classified as an sGRB.},

  abstract      = {We have identified a new supernova remnant (SNR), G51.04+0.07 (G51.04), using observations at 74 MHz from the VLA Low-Frequency Sky Survey Redux. Earlier, higher frequency radio continuum, recombination line, and infrared data had correctly inferred the presence of nonthermal radio emission within a large complex including ionised nebulae and active star formation. However, our observations have allowed us to redefine at least one SNR as a relatively small source (7'.5 x 3' in size) located at the southern periphery of the originally defined SNR candidate. The integrated flux density of G51.04 at 74 MHz is 6.1 +/- 0.8 Jy, while its radio continuum spectrum has a slope alpha=-0.52 +/- 0.05, typical of a shell-type remnant. We also measured spatial variations in the spectral index between 74 and 1400\~{}MHz across the source, ranging from a steeper spectrum (alpha\~{}-0.50) coincident with the brightest emission to a flatter component (alpha\~{}-0.30) in the surrounding fainter region. To probe the interstellar medium into which the redefined SNR is likely evolving, we have analysed the surrounding atomic and molecular gas using the 21\~{}cm neutral hydrogen (HI) and 13CO (J=1-0) emissions. We found that G51.04 is confined within an HI cavity and that its radio emission is consistent with the remains of a stellar explosion that occurred \~{}6300 yr ago at a distance of \~{}7.7 kpc. Kinematic data suggest that the newly discovered SNR lies in front of HII regions in the complex, consistent with the lack of a low frequency turnover in the continuum spectrum. The CO observations revealed molecular material that traces the central and northern parts of G51.04. The interaction between the cloud and the radio source is not conclusive. The relatively low flux density (\~{}1.5 Jy at 1400 MHz) of G51.04 is consistent with many similar SNRs hidden along complex lines of sight towards inner Galactic emission complexes.},

These GGLs provide insights into the mass distributions at larger scales than the strong lensing region in the cluster cores. We built parametric mass models for three of these GGLs showing simple lensing configurations, in order to assess the properties of their lens and its environment. We show that the local shear estimated from the GGLs traces the gravitational potential of the clusters at 1-2 arcmin radial distance, allowing us to derive their velocity dispersion. We also find a good agreement between the strength of the shear measured at the GGL positions through strong-lensing modelling and the value derived independently from a weak-lensing analysis of the background sources. Overall, we show the advantages of using single GGL events in the outskirts of clusters to robustly constrain the local shear, even when only photometric redshift estimates are known for the source. We argue that the mass-luminosity scaling relation of cluster members can be tested by modelling the GGLs found around them, and show that the mass parameters can vary up to $\sim$30\% between the cluster and GGL models assuming this scaling relation.},

  abstract      = {Acting as powerful gravitational lenses, the strong lensing galaxy clusters of the deep $\{$$\backslash$it Hubble$\}$ Frontier Fields (HFF) program permit access to lower-luminosity galaxies lying at higher redshifts than hitherto possible. We analyzed the HFF to measure the volume density of Lyman-break galaxies at $z \gt 4.75$ by identifying a complete and reliable sample up to $z \simeq 10$. A marked deficit of such galaxies was uncovered in the highly magnified regions of the clusters relative to their outskirts, implying that the magnification of the sky area dominates over additional faint galaxies magnified above the flux limit. This negative magnification bias is consistent with a slow rollover at the faint end of the UV luminosity function, and indicates a preference for Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter with a light boson mass of $m\_\mathrm{B} \simeq 10^{-22} \, \mathrm{eV}$ over standard cold dark matter. We emphasize that measuring the magnification bias requires no correction for multiply lensed images (with typically three or more images per source), whereas directly reconstructing the luminosity function will lead to an overestimate unless such images can be exhaustively matched up, especially at the faint end that is accessible only in the strongly lensed regions. In addition, we detected a distinctive downward transition in galaxy number density at $z \gtrsim 8$, which may be linked to the relatively late reionization reported by $\{$$\backslash$it Planck$\}$. Our results suggests that $\{$$\backslash$it JWST$\}$ will likely peer into an ``abyss'' with essentially no galaxies detected in deep NIR imaging at $z \gt 10$.},

A theoretical solution to this paradox locates the missing baryons in the hot and tenuous filamentary gas between galaxies, known as the warm-hot intergalactic medium. However, it is difficult to detect them there because the largest by far constituent of this gas - hydrogen - is mostly ionized and therefore almost invisible in far-ultraviolet spectra with typical signal-to-noise ratios. Indeed, despite the large observational efforts, only a few marginal claims of detection have been made so far. Here we report observations of two absorbers of highly ionized oxygen (OVII) in the high signal-to-noise-ratio X-ray spectrum of a quasar at redshift $\gt$0.4. These absorbers show no variability over a 2-year timescale and have no associated cold absorption, making the assumption that they originate from the quasar's intrinsic outflow or the host galaxy's interstellar medium implausible. The OVII systems lie in regions characterized by large (x4 compared to average) galaxy over-densities and their number (down to the sensitivity threshold of our data), agrees well with numerical simulation predictions for the long-sought warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). We conclude that the missing baryons have been found.},

  abstract      = {In this paper, we present a semi-analytic model for self-consistently evolving a population of globular clusters (GCs) in a given host galaxy across cosmic time. We use this model to compute the fraction of GCs still hosting intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) at a given redshift in early and late type galaxies of different masses and sizes, and the corresponding rate of tidal disruption events (TDEs) between stars and IMBHs. This is done for both main-sequence (MS) and white dwarf (WD) stars, and we compare their relative rates as a function of cosmic time for different assumed time-averaged stellar mass functions. We find that, for many host galaxies, the integrated TDE rate for the entire GC population can exceed the corresponding rates in a given galactic nucleus due to an SMBH and that 50\% and 90\% of the TDEs reside in GCs within a maximum radius of $\sim 2-4$ kpc and $\sim 5-15$ kpc, respectively, from the host galaxy's center. This suggests that observational efforts designed to identify TDEs should not confine themselves to galactic nuclei alone, but should also consider the outer galactic halo where massive old GCs hosting IMBHs would reside. Indeed, such off-centre TDEs as predicted here may already have been observed. We further find that the TDE rates in elliptical and spiral galaxies are similar to within $10\\%$. MS TDE rates are more common than WD TDE rates by a factor 30 (100) at $z\leq 0.5$ ($z=2$). We also calculate the rate of IMBH-SBH mergers across cosmic time, finding that the typical IMRI rate at low redshift is of the order of $\approx 0.5-3$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, which becomes as high as $\approx 100$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ near the peak of GC formation at $z=3$. Advanced ET combined with LIGO, VIRGO, KAGRA and $\backslash$textit$\{$LISA$\}$ will be able to observe the top-end and bottom-end of the IMBH population, respectively.},

  abstract      = {The gravitational interaction at parsec to sub-parsec scales between a circumbinary gas disc and a super massive black hole binary (SMBHB) is a promising mechanism to drive the migration of SMBHBs toward coalescence. The typical dynamical evolution can be separated in two main regimes: I) Slow migration ($T\_{\rm mig}$ $\sim$ $10^{3-4}\times T\_{\rm orb}$), where viscous torques are not efficient enough to redistribute the extracted angular momentum from the binary, leading to the formation of a low density cavity around the binary. II) Fast migration ($T\_{\rm mig}$ $\sim$ $10^{1-2} \times T\_{\rm orb}$), in which the redistribution of angular momentum is efficient and no low density cavity is formed in the circumbinary disc. Using N-Body/SPH simulations we study the effect of AGN feedback in this phase of a SMBHB evolution. We implement an AGN feedback model in the SPH code Gadget-3 that includes momentum feedback from winds, X-ray heating/radial-momentum and Eddington force. Using this implementation we run a set of simulations of SMBHB+disc in the two main shrinking regimes. From these simulations we conclude that the effect of the AGN mechanical feedback is negligible for SMBHBs in the slowly shrinking regime. However, in the fast shrinking regime the AGN wind excavate a ``feedback cavity'' leaving the SMBHB almost naked, thus stalling the orbital decay of the binary.},

We find a range in the parameter space of DDM models where we both expect efficient accretion to occur and which is consistent with observations of a large sample of measured SMBHs.

We present two ConvNet lens-finders which we have trained with a dataset composed of real galaxies from the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) and simulated lensed sources. One ConvNet is trained with single r-band galaxy images, hence basing the classification mostly on the morphology. While the other ConvNet is trained on g-r-i composite images, relying mostly on colours and morphology. We have tested the ConvNet lens-finders on a sample of 21789 Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) selected from KiDS and we have analyzed and compared the results with our previous ConvNet lens-finder on the same sample. The new lens-finders achieve a higher accuracy and completeness in identifying gravitational lens candidates, especially the single-band ConvNet. Our analysis indicates that this is mainly due to improved simulations of the lensed sources. In particular, the single-band ConvNet can select a sample of lens candidates with $\sim50\\%$ purity, retrieving 3 out of 4 of the confirmed gravitational lenses in the LRG sample. This is encouraging in view of forthcoming campaigns, such as Euclid, when automatic classification methods will be crucial in identifying gravitational lenses in the huge amount of data.},

  abstract      = {Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs: masses between $100 - 10^{6} M\_{\odot}$) historically comprise of an elusive population compared to stellar-mass and supermassive BHs. Recently IMBHs have started to be observed at the centers of low-mass galaxies. Using a modified version of the SPH code GADGET-3, we perform small-volume cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, and investigate the growth and feedback of central IMBHs in dwarf galaxies (DGs). Black Holes of mass $(10^{2} - 10^{4}) M\_{\odot}$ are seeded at the centers of halos with $(10^{6} - 5 \times 10^{7}) M\_{\odot}$. The earliest BHs appear at $z \sim 18 - 25$, and grow thereafter by accreting surrounding gas and by merger with other BHs. We find that it is possible to build up IMBHs of a few$\times 10^{5} - 10^{6} M\_{\odot}$ by $z = 5$, when the BHs are seeded in halos less massive than $4 \times 10^{7} M\_{\odot}$. The star formation rate density evolution of the DGs (stellar mass $10^{5} - 10^{8} M\_{\odot}$) has a peak plateau between $z = 4 - 6$. Star formation is quenched between $z = 9 - 4$ by BH accretion and feedback. The star formation rate density (SFRD) is reduced by factors up to $3$, when the BHs have grown to a few times $10^5 M\_{\odot}$. However these IMBHs in DGs are already more massive (at $z \sim 6$) compared to the local $[M\_{\rm BH} - M\_{\star}]$ correlation and that of high-$z$ quasars. Our conclusions, based on numerical simulation results, support the scenario that early feedback from IMBHs in gas-rich DGs at $z = 5 - 8$ can potentially solve several anomalies in the DG mass range within the concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmological scenario of galaxy formation (Silk 2017). Our results suggest that IMBHs at DG centers grow faster than their host galaxies in the early Universe, and the resulting BH feedback turns the DGs and the BHs dormant. (Abridged)},

  abstract      = {On small scales there have been a number of claims of discrepancies between the standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model and observations. The 'missing satellites problem' infamously describes the overabundance of subhalos from CDM simulations compared to the number of satellites observed in the Milky Way. A variety of solutions to this discrepancy have been proposed; however, the impact of the specific properties of the Milky Way halo relative to the typical halo of its mass have yet to be explored. Motivated by recent studies that identified ways in which the Milky Way is atypical (e.g., Licquia et al. 2015), we investigate how the properties of dark matter halos with mass comparable to our Galaxy's --- including concentration, spin, shape, and scale factor of the last major merger --- correlate with the subhalo abundance. Using zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-like halos, we build two models of subhalo abundance as functions of host halo properties and conclude that the Milky Way should be expected to have 22\%-44\% fewer subhalos with low maximum rotation velocities ($V\_{\rm max}^{\rm sat} \sim 10$kms$^{-1}$) at the 95\% confidence level and up to 72\% fewer than average subhalos with high rotation velocities ($V\_{\rm max}^{\rm sat} \gtrsim 30$kms$^{-1}$, comparable to the Magellanic Clouds) than would be expected for a typical halo of the Milky Way's mass. Concentration is the most informative single parameter for predicting subhalo abundance. Our results imply that models tuned to explain the missing satellites problem assuming typical subhalo abundances for our Galaxy will be over-correcting.},

  abstract      = {Triangulum (M33) is the most massive satellite galaxy of Andromeda (M31), with a stellar mass of about $3\times10^9\; M\_{\odot}$. Based on abundance matching techniques, M33's total mass at infall is estimated to be of order $10^{11}\; M\_{\odot}$. $\Lambda$CDM simulations predict that M33-mass halos host several of their own low mass satellite companions, yet only one candidate M33 satellite has been detected in deep photometric surveys to date. This `satellites of satellites' hierarchy has recently been explored in the context of the dwarf galaxies discovered around the Milky Way's Magellanic Clouds in the Dark Energy Survey. Here we discuss the number of satellite galaxies predicted to reside within the virial radius ($\sim$160 kpc) of M33 based on $\Lambda$CDM simulations. We also calculate the expected number of satellite detections in N fields of data using various ground--based imagers. Finally, we discuss how these satellite population predictions change as a function of M33's past orbital history. If M33 is on its first infall into M31's halo, its proposed satellites are expected to remain bound to M33 today. However, if M33 experienced a recent tidal interaction with M31, the number of surviving satellites depends strongly on the distance achieved at pericenter due to the effects of tidal stripping. We conclude that a survey extending to $\sim$100 kpc around M33 would be sufficient to constrain its orbital history and a majority of its satellite population. In the era of WFIRST, surveys of this size will be considered small observing programs.},

The background object is highly resolved in the tangential and radial directions, showing evidence of both compact and extended structure across several gravitational arcs that are 200 to 600\~{}mas in size. By identifying compact sub-components in the multiple images, we constrain the mass distribution of the foreground z=0.35 gravitational lens using analytic models for the main deflector [power-law elliptical mass model; $\rho(r) \propto r^{-\gamma}$, where $\gamma=2$ corresponds to isothermal] and for the members of the galaxy group. Moreover, our mass models with and without the group find an inner mass-density slope steeper than isothermal for the main lensing galaxy, with $\gamma\_1 = 2.08 \pm 0.02$ and $\gamma\_2 = 2.16 \pm 0.02$ at the 4.2$\sigma$ level and 6.8$\sigma$ level, respectively, at the Einstein radius ($b\_1 = 0.4025 \pm 0.0008$ and $b\_2 = 0.307 \pm 0.002$ arcsec, respectively). We find randomly distributed image position residuals of about 3 mas, which are much larger that the measurement errors ($40$ $\mu$as on average). This suggests that at the mas level, the assumption of a smooth mass distribution fails, requiring additional structure in the model. However, given the environment of the lensing galaxy, it is not clear whether this extra mass is in the form of sub-haloes within the lens or along the line of sight, or from a more complex halo for the galaxy group.},

  abstract      = {The nature of the seeds of the observed high-z super-massive black holes (SMBH) is unknown. Although different options have been proposed, involving e.g. intermediate mass direct collapse black holes, BH remnants of massive stars remain the most natural explanation. To identify the most favorable conditions (if any) for their rapid growth, we study the accretion rate of a M\_BH = 100M\_sun BH formed in a typical z = 10 galaxy under different conditions (e.g. galaxy structure, BH initial position and velocity). We model the galaxy baryonic content and follow the BH orbit and accretion history for 300 Myr (the time span in 10 $\gt$ z $\gt$ 7), assuming the radiation-regulated accretion model by Park {\amp} Ricotti (2013). We find that, within the limits of our model, BH seeds cannot grow by more than 30 percent, suggesting that accretion on light-seed models are inadequate to explain high-z SMBH. We also compute the X-ray emission from such accreting stellar BH population in the (0.5, 8) keV band and find it comparable to the one produced by high-mass X-ray binaries. This study suggests that early BHs, by X-ray pre-heating of the intergalactic medium at cosmic dawn, might leave a specific signature on the HI 21 cm line power spectrum potentially detectable with SKA.},

Such jet wobbling can be indicative of a relativistic Lense-Thirring precession resulting from a tilted accretion disc. The wobbling period together with up-to-date kinematic data on jet rotation opens up the possibility for estimating angular momentum of the central supermassive black hole. In the case of a test-particle precession, the specific angular momentum is $J/Mc=(2.7\pm1.5)\times10^{14}$ cm, implying moderate dimensionless spin parameters $a=0.5\pm0.3$ and $0.31\pm0.17$ for controversial gas-dynamic and stellar-dynamic black hole masses. However, in the case of a solid-body-like precession, the spin parameter is much smaller for both masses, $0.15\pm0.05$. Rejecting this value on the basis of other independent spin estimations requires the existence of a magnetically arrested disc in M87.},

  abstract      = {This paper briefly reviews past, current, and future efforts to image black holes in the radio regime. Black holes seem like mystical objects, but they are an integral part of current astrophysics and are at the center of attempts to unify quantum physics and general relativity. Yet, nobody has ever seen a black hole. What do they look like? Initially, this question seemed more of an academic nature. However, this has changed over the past two decades. Observations and theoretical considerations suggest that the supermassive black hole, Sgr A*, in the center of our Milky Way is surrounded by a compact, foggy emission region radiating at and above 230 GHz. It has been predicted that the event horizon of Sgr A* should cast its shadow onto that emission region, which could be detectable with a global VLBI array of radio telescopes. In contrast to earlier pictures of black holes, that dark feature is not supposed to be due to a hole in the accretion flow, but would represent a true negative image of the event horizon. Currently, the global Event Horizon Telescope consortium is attempting to make such an image. In the future those images could be improved by adding more telescopes to the array, in particular at high sites in Africa. Ultimately, a space array at THz frequencies, the Event Horizon Imager, could produce much more detailed images of black holes. In combination with numerical simulations and precise measurements of the orbits of stars - ideally also of pulsars - these images will allow us to study black holes with unprecedented precision.},

Mirror helium being rather light, $m \simeq 3.73$ GeV, generally produces sub-keV recoils in direct detection experiments. Recently, the CRESST-III experiment has began probing the sub-keV recoil energy region and is currently the most sensitive probe of such particles. We point out here that the small excess seen in the low energy recoil data obtained in the CRESST-III experiment is consistent with mirror helium scattering if the kinetic mixing parameter is around $\epsilon \approx 5 \times 10^{-10}$. This kinetic mixing strength lies within the estimated range favoured by small scale structure considerations.},

  abstract      = {Classical abundance matching has been shown to produce mass estimates, $M^{\rm abund}\_{200}$, that agree well with independent dynamical estimates, $M^{\rm dyn}\_{200}$, for isolated dwarfs. However, for satellite galaxies, it is expected to fail. This is because tidal stripping lowers $M\_*$ and $M^{\rm dyn}\_{200}$, causing satellites to scatter above the $M\_*-M\_{200}$ relation for isolated dwarfs, while ram-pressure stripping quenches star formation on infall, causing satellites to scatter below the relation. In this paper, we introduce a novel abundance matching technique that produces a more accurate estimate of $M\_{200}$ for satellite galaxies. To achieve this, we abundance match with the mean star formation rate, averaged over the time when a galaxy was forming stars, $\langle {\rm SFR}\rangle$, instead of $M\_*$. Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Bolshoi simulation, we obtain a statistical $\langle {\rm SFR}\rangle-{\rm M}\_{200}$ relation in $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$. We then compare $M^{\rm abund}\_{200}$ derived from this relation with $M^{\rm dyn}\_{200}$ for 21 nearby dSph and dIrr galaxies, finding a good agreement between the two. As a first application, we use our new $\langle {\rm SFR}\rangle-{\rm M}\_{200}$ relation to empirically measure the cumulative mass function of a volume-complete sample of bright Milky Way satellites within 280 kpc of the Galactic centre. We compare this with a suite of cosmological 'zoom' simulations of Milky Way-mass halos that account for subhalo depletion by the Milky Way disc. Including a conservative lower bound on the number of 'ultra-faint' dwarfs in this same volume, we find no missing satellites problem above $M\_{200} \sim 10^9$M$\_\odot$ in the Milky Way. We discuss how this empirical method can be applied to a larger sample of spiral galaxies in the Local Volume.},

The properties and rates of these directly relates to the stellar population which gave rise to their progenitors, and thus to other, electromagnetic transients which result from stellar death. We aim to estimate simultaneously the event rates and delay time distribution of gravitational wave-driven compact object mergers together with the rates of core collapse and thermonuclear supernovae within a single consistent stellar population synthesis paradigm. We combine event delay-time distributions at different metallicities from the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) models with an analytic model of the volume-averaged cosmic star formation rate density and chemical evolution to determine the volume-averaged rates of each event rate at the current time. We estimate rates in excellent agreement with extant observational constraints on core-collapse supernovae, thermonuclear supernovae and long GRBs. We predict rates for gravitational wave mergers based on the same stellar populations, and find rates consistent with current LIGO estimates. We note that tighter constraints on the rates of these events will be required before it is possible to determine their redshift evolution, progenitor metallicity dependence or constrain uncertain aspects of stellar evolution.},

As a case study we focus on Reticulum II, the dwarf which shows the strongest evidence for a gamma-ray signal in Fermi data. Dark matter models and those with curved energy spectra provide good fits to the data, while a simple power law is ruled out at 97.5\% confidence. We compare RetII's spectrum to known classes of gamma-ray sources and find a useful representation in terms of spectral curvature and the energy at which the spectral energy distribution peaks. In this space the blazar classes appear segregated from the confidence region occupied by RetII. Pulsars have similar gamma-ray spectra to RetII but we show that RetII is unlikely to host a pulsar population detectable in gamma rays. Tensions with astrophysical explanations are stronger when analyzing 6.5 years of Pass 7 than with the same amount of Pass 8 data, where the excess is less significant. These methods are applicable to any dwarf galaxy which is a promising dark matter target and shows signs of gamma-ray emission along its line of sight.},

This evidence is so strong and consequential that it must be taken as the starting point for the investigation on the issue of the dark matter in galaxies.

  abstract      = {The evidence of the phenomenon for which, in galaxies, the gravitating mass is distributed differently than the luminous mass, increases as new data become available. Furthermore, this discrepancy is well structured and it depends on the magnitude and the compactness of the galaxy and on the radius, in units of its luminous size $R\_{opt}$, where the measurement is performed. For the disk systems with $-13\geq M\_I\geq -24$ all this leads to an amazing scenario, revealed by the investigation of individual and coadded rotation curves, according to which, the circular velocity follows, from their centers out to their virial radii, an universal profile $V\_{URC} (r/R\_{opt}, M\_I)$ function only of the properties of the luminous mass component. Moreover, from the Universal Rotation Curve, so as from many individual high-quality RCs, we discover that, in the innermost regions of galaxies, the DM halo density profiles are very shallow. Finally, the disk mass, the central halo density and its core radius, come out all related to each other and to two properties of the distribution of light in galaxies: the luminosity and the compactness. This phenomenology, being absent in the simplest $\Lambda CDM$ Cosmology scenario, poses serious challenges to the latter or, alternatively, it requires a substantial and tuned involvement of baryons in the formation of the galactic halos.

  abstract      = {The recently discovered S1 stream passes through the Solar neighbourhood on a low inclination, counter-rotating orbit. The progenitor of S1 is a dwarf galaxy with a total mass comparable to the present-day Fornax dwarf spheroidal, so the stream is expected to have a significant DM component. We compute the effects of the S1 stream on WIMP and axion detectors as a function of the density of its unmeasured dark component. In WIMP detectors the S1 stream supplies more high energy nuclear recoils so will marginally improve DM detection prospects. We find that even if S1 comprises less than 10\% of the local density, multi-ton xenon WIMP detectors can distinguish the S1 stream from the bulk halo in the relatively narrow mass range between 5 and 25 GeV. In directional WIMP detectors such as CYGNUS, S1 increases DM detection prospects more substantially since it enhances the anisotropy of the WIMP signal. Finally, we show that axion haloscopes possess by far the greatest potential sensitivity to the S1 stream. Once the axion mass has been discovered, the distinctive velocity distribution of S1 can easily be extracted from the axion power spectrum.},

  abstract      = {Cross correlation with thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect in cosmic microwave background observation and weak gravitational lensing effect in galaxy imaging survey opens a new window on constraining matter contents in the Universe at redshift less than 1. In this paper, we study the impact of radio sources and cosmic infrared background (CIB) on observed tSZ-lensing correlation. Assuming the best-fit model of CIB by the Planck satellite, we estimate that the residual correlation of CIB with large-scale structures will be of an order of $2\\%$ of expected tSZ-lensing correlation from intracluster medium in current lensing surveys. On the other hand, we find that correlation of lensing and radio sources can induce a negative correction for the observed tSZ-lensing correlation with a $\sim10\\%$ level. This is originated from positive cross correlation with radio sources and lensing at $\sim100\, {\rm GHz}$ frequency, whereas tSZ-lensing correlation should show a negative value in temperature fluctuations at that frequency. We also show that the negative correction by radio-lensing correlation can solve the tension between recent measurements of tSZ-lensing correlation and an expected signal from ``universal'' gas pressure profile of nearby galaxy clusters, when the radio sources with flat-spectral index are assumed to populate massive cluster-sized dark matte halos. Our results indicate that minor source population in radio bands can play an important role in determining observed tSZ-lensing correlation at $\lt10$ arcmin.},

  abstract      = {Strong-gravitational lens systems with quadruply-imaged quasars (quads) are unique probes to address several fundamental problems in cosmology and astrophysics. Although they are intrinsically very rare, ongoing and planned wide-field deep-sky surveys are set to discover thousands of such systems in the next decade. It is thus paramount to devise a general framework to model strong-lens systems to cope with this large influx without being limited by expert investigator time. We propose such a general modelling framework (implemented with the publicly available software Lenstronomy) and apply it to uniformly model three band Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 images of 12 quads. This is the largest uniformly modelled sample of quads to date and paves the way for a variety of studies. To illustrate the scientific content of the sample, we investigate the alignment between the mass and light distribution in the deflectors. The position angles of these distributions are well-aligned, except when there is strong external shear. However, we find no correlation between the ellipticity of the light and mass distributions. We also show that the observed flux-ratios between the images depart significantly from the predictions of simple smooth models. The departures are strongest in the bluest band, consistent with microlensing being the dominant cause in addition to millilensing. Future papers will exploit this rich dataset in combination with ground based spectroscopy and time delays to determine quantities such as the Hubble constant, the free streaming length of dark matter, and the normalization of the initial stellar mass function.},

  abstract      = {In this paper, we study the secular dynamical evolution of binaries composed of intermediate-mass and stellar-mass black holes (IMBHs and SBHs, respectively) in orbit about a central super-massive black hole (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. Such BH triplets could form via the inspiral of globular clusters toward galactic nuclei due to dynamical friction, or even major/minor galaxy mergers. We perform, for reasonable initial conditions that we justify, sophisticated $N$-body simulations that include both regularization and Post-Newtonian corrections. We find that mass segregation combined with Kozai-Lidov oscillations induced by the primary SMBH can effectively merge IMBH-SBH binaries on time-scales much shorter than gravitational wave emission alone. Moreover, the rate of such extreme mass ratio inspirals could be high ($\sim 1\ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$) in the local Universe, but these are expected to be associated with recent GC infall or major/minor mergers, making the observational signatures of such events (e.g., tidal debris) good diagnostics for searching for SMBH-IMBH-SBH mergers. A small fraction could also be associated with tidal disruption events by the IMBH-SBH during inspiral.},

  abstract      = {We present an improved semi-analytic model for calculation of the broad optical emission-line signatures from sub-parsec supermassive black hole binaries (SBHBs) in circumbinary disks. The second-generation model improves upon the treatment of radiative transfer by taking into account the effect of the radiation driven, accretion disk wind on the properties of the emission-line profiles. Analysis of 42.5 million modeled emission-line profiles shows that correlations between the profile properties and SBHB parameters identified in the first-generation model are preserved, indicating that their diagnostic power is not diminished. The profile shapes are a more sensitive measure of the binary orbital separation and the degree of alignment of the black hole mini-disks, and are less sensitive to the SBHB mass ratio and orbital eccentricity. We also find that modeled profile shapes are more compatible with the observed sample of SBHB candidates than with our control sample of regular AGNs. Furthermore, if the observed sample of SBHBs is made up of genuine binaries, it must include compact systems with comparable masses, and misaligned mini-disks. We note that the model described in this paper can be used to interpret the observed emission-line profiles once a sample of confirmed SBHBs is available but cannot be used to prove that the observed SBHB candidates are true binaries.},

We provide a framework to study the generation of polarization of a stochastic background of gravitational waves propagating in an inhomogeneous universe. The framework is general and can be applied to both cosmological and astrophysical gravitational wave backgrounds in any frequency range. We derive an order of magnitude estimate of the amount of polarization generated for cosmological and astrophysical backgrounds, in the frequency range covered by present and planned gravitational wave experiments. For an astrophysical background in the PTA and LISA band, the amount of polarization generated is suppressed by a factor $10^{-4}$ $(10^{-5})$ with respect to anisotropies. For a cosmological background we get an additional $10^{-2}$ suppression. We speculate on using our approach to map the distribution of (unresolvable) structures in the Universe.},

  abstract      = {We study the source-subtracted near-infrared and X-ray background fluctuations of the COSMOS field using data from the Spitzer SPLASH program ($\sim$1272 hours) and Chandra COSMOS Legacy Survey (4.6 Ms). The new auto power spectra of the cosmic infrared and X-ray background fluctuations reach maximum angular scales of $\sim$ 3000$''$ and $\sim$ 5000$''$, respectively. We measure the cross power spectra between each infrared and X-ray band and calculate the mean power above 20$''$. We find that the soft X-ray band is correlated with 3.6 and 4.5$\mu$m at $\sim$ 4 $\sigma$ significance level. The significance between hard X-ray and the 3.6$\mu$m (4.5$\mu$m) band is $\sim$2.2 $\sigma$ ($\sim$3.8$\sigma$). The combined infrared (3.6 + 4.5$\mu$m) data are correlated with the X-ray data in soft ([0.5-2] keV), hard ([2-7] keV) and broad ([0.5-7] keV) bands at $\sim$5.6$\sigma$, $\sim$4.4$\sigma$ and $\sim$6.6$\sigma$ level, respectively. We compare the new measurements with existing models for the contributions from known populations at $z$$\lt$7, which are not subtracted. The model predictions are consistent with the measurements but we cannot rule out contributions from other components, such as Direct Collapse Black Holes (DCBH). However, the stacked cross-power spectra, combining other available data, show excess fluctuations about an order of magnitude on average at $\sim$4$\sigma$ confidence at scales within $\sim$300$''$. By studying the X-ray SED of the cross-power signal, assuming no significant variation from the infrared, we find that its shape is consistent with DCBHs.},

  abstract    = {Context. Astrometric gravitational microlensing is an excellent tool to determine the mass of stellar objects. Using precise astrometric measurements of the lensed position of a background source in combination with accurate predictions of the positions of lens and unlensed source it is possible to determine the mass of the lens with an accuracy of a few percent. Aims. Making use of the recently published Gaia DR2 catalogue we want to predict astrometric microlensing events by foreground stars with high proper motion passing a background source in the next decades. Methods .We select roughly 148 000 high-proper-motion stars from Gaia DR2 with mu_tot >150mas/yr as potential lenses. We then search for background sources close to their paths. Using the astrometric parameters of Gaia DR2 we calculate the future positions of source and lens. With a nested-intervals algorithm we determine the date and separation of the closest approach. Using Gaia DR2 photometry we determine an approximate mass of the lens, which we use to calculate the expected microlensing effects. Results. We predict 3914 microlensing events by 2875 different lenses between 2010 and 2065 with expected shifts larger than 0.1 mas between the lensed and unlensed positions of the source. 513 of those are expected to happen between 2014.5 - 2026.5 and might be measured by Gaia. For 127 events we also expect a magnification between 1 mmag and 3 mag.},

We perform scattering experiments between tight stellar binaries and an SMBH-IMBH binary (within the observationally allowed parameters), using high-precision N-body integrations. Simulation results show that only a few HVBs can be produced in the Galactic center if it harbors a $4\times10^3M_\odot$ IMBH. However, we find that tight HVBs can be efficiently produced in prograde coplanar orbits with respect to the SMBH-IMBH binary. Therefore, the trajectories of the HVBs provide a promising way to constrain the IMBH orbital plane, if one exists. More importantly, we find that the ejected tight binaries are eccentric. For other galaxies hosting equal-mass SMBH binaries for which the HVB ejection rate is much higher relative to SMBH-IMBH binaries, these ejected compact binaries constitute promising extragalactic merger sources that could be detected by gravitational wave detectors.},

  abstract    = {The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect gravitational-wave (GW) signals from merging supermassive black holes (BHs) with masses below $10^7$~M$_{\odot}$. It is thus of paramount importance to understand the orbital dynamics of these relatively light central BHs, which typically reside in disc-dominated galaxies, in order to produce reliable forecasts of merger rates. To this aim, realistic simulations probing BH dynamics in unequal-mass disc galaxy mergers, into and beyond the binary hardening stage, are performed by combining smooth particle hydrodynamics and direct $N$-body codes. The structural properties and orbits of the galaxies are chosen to be consistent with the results of galaxy formation simulations. Stellar and dark matter distributions are triaxial down to the central 100 pc of merger remnant. In all cases, a BH binary forms and hardens on time-scales of at most 100~Myr, coalescing on another few hundred Myr time-scale, depending on the characteristic density and orbital eccentricity. Overall, the sinking of the BH binary takes no more than $\sim$0.5~Gyr after the merger of the two galaxies is completed, but can be much faster for very plunging orbits. Comparing with previous numerical simulations following the decay of BHs in massive early-type galaxies at $z \sim 3$, we confirm that the characteristic density is the most crucial parameter determining the overall BH merging time-scale, despite the structural diversity of the host galaxies. Our results lay down the basis for robust forecasts of LISA event rates in the case of merging BHs.},

Those stars do not trace the extended distribution of dark matter well as they are located in the central regions of the cluster's dark matter sub-halos. A small fraction of stars is expected, however, to follow the global dark matter shape of the cluster. These are the stars whose extended spatial distribution results from the merging activity of galaxies and form the intracluster light (ICL). In this work, we compare the bi-dimensional distribution of dark matter in massive galaxy clusters (as traced by gravitational lensing models) with the distribution of the ICL. To do that, we use the exquisite data from the Hubble Frontier Fields Initiative. Using the Modified Hausdorff distance (MHD) as a way of quantifying the similarities between the mass and ICL distributions, we find an excellent agreement (MHD\~{}25 kpc) between the two components. This result shows that the ICL exquisitely follows the global dark matter distribution, providing an accurate luminous tracer of dark matter. This finding opens up the possibility of exploring the distribution of dark matter in galaxy clusters in detail using only deep imaging observations.},

In the first part, we focus on the mainstream channels proposed for the formation of stellar mass binaries relevant to ground-based gravitational wave detectors, namely the $\{$$\backslash$it field$\}$ and the $\{$$\backslash$it dynamical$\}$ scenarios. For the field scenario, we highlight the relevant steps in the evolution of the binary, including mass transfer, supernovae explosions and kicks, common envelope and gravitational wave emission. For the dynamical scenario, we describe the main physical processes involved in the formation of star clusters and the segregation of black holes in their centres. We then identify the dynamical processes leading to binary formation, including three-body capture, exchanges and hardening. The second part of the notes is devoted to massive black hole formation and evolution, including the physics leading to mass accretion and binary formation. Throughout the notes, we provide several step-by-step pedagogical derivations, that should be particularly suited to undergraduates and PhD students, but also to gravitational wave physicists interested in approaching the subject of gravitational wave sources from an astrophysical perspective.},

The z = 0 simulation is analysed into filaments, walls, and voids using the SpineWeb method and also the VIDE package of tools, both of which use the watershed transform. The key halo properties that we study are the specific mass accretion rate, spin parameter, concentration, prolateness, scale factor of the last major merger, and scale factor when the halo had half of its z = 0 mass. For all these properties, we find that there is no discernible difference between the halo properties in filaments, walls, or voids when compared at the same environmental density. As a result, we conclude that environmental density is the core attribute that affects these properties. This conclusion is in line with recent findings that properties of galaxies in redshift surveys are independent of their cosmic web environment at the same environmental density at z \~{} 0. We also find that the local web environment of the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxies near the centre of a cosmic wall does not appear to have any effect on the properties of these galaxies' dark matter halos except for their orientation, although we find that it is rather rare to have such massive halos near the centre of a relatively small cosmic wall.},

We identify two primary causes of halo mass loss: relaxation after a major merger and tidal stripping by a massive neighbouring halo. Major mergers initially boost $M\_{\mathrm{vir}}$ and typically cause the final halo to become more prolate and less relaxed and to have higher spin and lower NFW concentration. As the halo relaxes, high energy material from the recent merger gradually escapes beyond the virial radius, temporarily resulting in a net negative accretion rate that reduces the halo mass by $5-15\\%$ on average. Halos that experience a major merger around $z = 0.4$ typically reach a minimum mass near $z = 0$. Tidal stripping mainly occurs in dense regions, and it causes halos to become less prolate and have lower spins and higher NFW concentrations. Tidally stripped halos often lose a large fraction of their peak mass ($\gt 20\\%$) and most never recover (or even reattain a positive accretion rate). Low mass halos can be strongly affected by both post-merger mass loss and tidal stripping, while high mass halos are predominantly influenced by post-merger mass loss and show few signs of significant tidal stripping.},

  abstract      = {SubHalo Abundance Matching (SHAM) assumes that one (sub)halo property, such as mass Mvir or peak circular velocity Vpeak, determines properties of the galaxy hosted in each (sub)halo such as its luminosity or stellar mass. This assumption implies that the dependence of Galaxy Luminosity Functions (GLFs) and the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) on environmental density is determined by the corresponding halo density dependence. In this paper, we test this by determining from an SDSS sample the observed dependence with environmental density of the ugriz GLFs and GSMF for all galaxies, and for central and satellite galaxies separately. We then show that the SHAM predictions are in remarkable agreement with these observations, even when the galaxy population is divided between central and satellite galaxies. However, we show that SHAM fails to reproduce the correct dependence between environmental density and g-r color for all galaxies and central galaxies, although it better reproduces the color dependence on environmental density of satellite galaxies.},

We utilize a compilation of 40 observational studies from the literature and correct them for potential biases. Using our robust determinations of halo mass assembly and the SHMR, we infer star formation histories, merger rates, and structural properties for average galaxies, combining star-forming and quenched galaxies. Our main findings: (1) The halo mass $M\_{50}$ above which 50$\backslash$\% of galaxies are quenched coincides with sSFR/sMAR$\sim1$, where sMAR is the specific halo mass accretion rate. (2) $M\_{50}$ increases with redshift, presumably due to cold streams being more efficient at high redshift while virial shocks and AGN feedback become more relevant at lower redshifts. (3) The ratio sSFR/sMAR has a peak value, which occurs around $M\_{\rm vir}\sim2\times10^{11}M\_{\odot}$. (4) The stellar mass density within 1 kpc, $\Sigma\_1$, is a good indicator of the galactic global sSFR. (5) Galaxies are statistically quenched after they reach a maximum in $\Sigma\_1$, consistent with theoretical expectations of the gas compaction model; this maximum depends on redshift. (6) In-situ star formation is responsible for most galactic stellar mass growth, especially for lower-mass galaxies. (7) Galaxies grow inside out. The marked change in the slope of the size--mass relation when galaxies became quenched, from $d\log R\_{\rm eff}/d\log M\_*\sim0.35$ to $\sim2.5$, could be the result of dry minor mergers.},

  abstract      = {We study how properties of discrete dark matter halos depend on halo environment, characterized by the mass density around the halos on scales from 0.5 to 16 $h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$. We find that low mass halos (those less massive than the characteristic mass $M\_{\rm C}$ of halos collapsing at a given epoch) in high-density environments have lower accretion rates, lower spins, higher concentrations, and rounder shapes than halos in median density environments. Halos in median and low-density environments have similar accretion rates and concentrations, but halos in low density environments have lower spins and are more elongated. Halos of a given mass in high-density regions accrete material earlier than halos of the same mass in lower-density regions. All but the most massive halos in high-density regions are losing mass (i.e., being stripped) at low redshifts, which causes artificially lowered NFW scale radii and increased concentrations. Tidal effects are also responsible for the decreasing spins of low mass halos in high density regions at low redshifts $z \lt 1$, by preferentially removing higher angular momentum material from halos. Halos in low-density regions have lower than average spins because they lack nearby halos whose tidal fields can spin them up. We also show that the simulation density distribution is well fit by an Extreme Value Distribution, and that the density distribution becomes broader with cosmic time.},

  abstract      = {We report and provide fitting functions for the abundance of dark matter halos and subhalos as a function of mass, circular velocity, and redshift from the new Bolshoi-Planck and MultiDark-Planck $\Lambda$CDM cosmological simulations, based on the Planck cosmological parameters. We also report the halo mass accretion rates, which may be connected with galaxy star formation rates. We show that the higher cosmological matter density of the Planck parameters compared with the WMAP parameters leads to higher abundance of massive halos at high redshifts. We find that the median halo spin parameter $\lambda\_{\rm B} = J(2M\_{\rm vir}R\_{\rm vir}V\_{\rm vir})^{-1}$ is nearly independent of redshift, leading to predicted evolution of galaxy sizes that is consistent with observations, while the significant decrease with redshift in median $\lambda\_{\rm P} = J|E|^{-1/2}G^{-1}M^{-5/2}$ predicts more decrease in galaxy sizes than is observed. Using the Tully-Fisher and Faber-Jackson relations between galaxy velocity and mass, we show that a simple model of how galaxy velocity is related to halo maximum circular velocity leads to increasing overprediction of cosmic stellar mass density as redshift increases beyond redshifts $z\sim1$, implying that such velocity-mass relations must change at redshifts $z\gt1$. By making a realistic model of how observed galaxy velocities are related to halo circular velocity, we show that recent optical and radio observations of the abundance of galaxies are in good agreement with our $\Lambda$CDM simulations. Our halo demographics are based on updated versions of the $\backslash$rockstar$\backslash$ and $\backslash$ctrees$\backslash$ codes, and this paper includes appendices explaining all of their outputs.

We explore the effect by simulating a microlensing caustic crossing a spatially resolved model of emission from a thin accretion disk around a Kerr black hole. We demonstrate the sequence of spectral changes during the event, in particular the appearance of additional peaks and edges in the line profile due to microlensing. We trace the origin of these features to points on the disk, at which the total energy shift ($g$-factor) contours are tangent to the caustic. Contours tangent from the inner side of the caustic generate peaks, while those tangent from its outer side generate edges. We derive analytical shapes of the generated features and map the peak strength as a function of position of the tangent point on the disk. Since the features are determined by the positional geometry of the caustic relative to the $g$-factor contours, the same type of behavior can be expected in a much broader range of emission models. The sequence of line profile changes thus serves as a sensitive probe of the geometry and physics of the innermost region of the quasar accretion disk.},

  abstract     = {The dynamics of a test particle in a non-spinning binary black hole system of equal masses is numerically investigated. The binary system is modeled in the context of the pseudo-Newtonian circular restricted three-body problem, such that the primaries are separated by a fixed distance and move in a circular orbit around each other. In particular, the Paczy\'{n}ski-Wiita potential is used for describing the gravitational field of the two non-Newtonian primaries. The orbital properties of the test particle are determined through the classification of the initial conditions of the orbits, using several values of the Jacobi constant, in the Hill's regions of possible motion. The initial conditions are classified into three main categories: (i) bounded, (ii) escaping and (iii) displaying close encounters. Using the smaller alignment index (SALI) chaos indicator, we further classify bounded orbits into regular, sticky or chaotic. To gain a complete view of the dynamics of the system, we define grids of initial conditions on different types of two-dimensional planes. The orbital structure of the configuration plane, along with the corresponding distributions of the escape and collision/close encounter times, allow us to observe the transition from the classical Newtonian to the pseudo-Newtonian regime. Our numerical results reveal a strong dependence of the properties of the considered basins with the Jacobi constant as well as with the Schwarzschild radius of the black holes.},

Their radii increase on cosmological time scales at a rate of order $1$ kpc/Gyr. When a caustic ring passes through the orbit of a star, the orbit is strongly perturbed. We find that a star moving in a nearly circular orbit is first attracted towards the caustic ring, then moves with and oscillates about the caustic for approximately $1$ Gyr before returning to its original orbit. As a result, a stellar overdensity forms around the caustic ring. We predict such overdensities to be of order $120\%$ near the 2nd caustic ring where the Monoceros Ring is observed and of order $45$, $30$ and $15\%$ near the 3rd, 4th and 5th caustic rings, respectively. We show that the associated bulk velocities of the stars near the caustic rings are less than a few km/s. We also determine the density profile of interstellar gas near the 5th caustic ring assuming it is in thermal equilibrium in the gravitational potential of the caustic and of the gas itself.},

We derive an analytical model for the thickening of thin stellar streams and obtain an early conservative lower limit for the boson mass of $m\_a \gt 1.5 \times 10^{-22}~$eV, using pre-Gaia literature data for six Milky Way streams and after marginalizing over physical parameters. This demonstrates the great promise for using this novel dynamical method as a fully independent probe of FDM, to complement results based on Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data.},

Strong gravitational lensing has proven to be a useful tool for studying this small-scale structure. Much of the attention has been given to detecting individual dark matter subhalos through lens modeling, but recent work has suggested that the full population of subhalos could be probed using a power spectrum analysis. In this paper we quantify the power spectrum of small-scale structure in simulated galaxies, with the goal of understanding theoretical predictions and setting the stage for using measurements of the power spectrum to test dark matter models. We use a sample of simulated galaxies generated from the $\backslash$texttt$\{$Galacticus$\}$ semi-analytic model to determine the power spectrum distribution first in the CDM paradigm and then in a warm dark matter scenario. We find that a measurement of the slope and amplitude of the power spectrum on galaxy strong lensing scales ($k\sim 1$ kpc$^{-1}$) could be used to distinguish between CDM and alternate dark matter models, especially if the most massive subhalos can be directly detected via gravitational imaging.},

We treat the galactic disk as a gravitationally coupled, three-component system consisting of stars, atomic hydrogen gas, and molecular hydrogen gas in the gravitational field of the dark matter halo. The self-consistent vertical distribution for stars and gas in such a realistic system is obtained for radii between 4-22 kpc. The inclusion of an additional gravitating component constrains the vertical stellar distribution toward the mid-plane, so that the mid-plane density is higher, the disk thickness is reduced, and the vertical density profile is steeper than in the one-component, isothermal, stars-alone case. We show that the stellar distribution is constrained mainly by the gravitational field of gas and dark matter halo in the inner and the outer Galaxy, respectively. We find that the thickness of the stellar disk (measured as the HWHM of the vertical density distribution) increases with radius, flaring steeply beyond R=17 kpc. The disk thickness is reduced by a factor of 3-4 in the outer Galaxy as a result of the gravitational field of the halo, which may help the disk resist distortion at large radii. The disk would flare even more if the effect of dark matter halo were not taken into account. Thus it is crucially important to include the effect of the dark matter halo when determining the vertical structure and dynamics of a galactic disk in the outer region.},

Here we report measurements of the velocities of pairs of diametrically opposed satellite galaxies. In the local Universe (redshift z $\lt$ 0.05), we find that satellite pairs out to a distance of 150 kiloparsecs from the galactic centre are preferentially anti-correlated in their velocities (99.994 per cent confidence level), and that the distribution of galaxies in the larger-scale environment (out to distances of about 2 megaparsecs) is strongly clumped along the axis joining the inner satellite pair ($\gt$7{$\sigma$} confidence). This may indicate that planes of co-rotating satellites, similar to those seen around the Andromeda galaxy, are ubiquitous, and their coherent motion suggests that they represent a substantial repository of angular momentum on scales of about 100 kiloparsecs.},

We find that there are far too few subhaloes within 50 kpc of the Milky Way that had Vpeak $\gt$ 20 km/s to account for the number of ultrafaint galaxies already known within that volume today.

  abstract      = {On September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC the two detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory simultaneously observed a transient gravitational-wave signal. The signal sweeps upwards in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz with a peak gravitational-wave strain of 1.0 {\times}10$^{-21}$. It matches the waveform predicted by general relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole. The signal was observed with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate estimated to be less than 1 event per 203 000 years, equivalent to a significance greater than 5.1 {$\sigma$} . The source lies at a luminosity distance of 41 0$_{-180}$$^{+160}$ Mpc corresponding to a redshift z =0.0 9$_{-0.04}$$^{+0.03}$ . In the source frame, the initial black hole masses are 3 6$_{-4}$$^{+5}$M$_{⊙}$ and 2 9$_{-4}$$^{+4}$M$_{⊙}$ , and the final black hole mass is 6 2$_{-4}$$^{+4}$M$_{⊙}$ , with 3. 0$_{-0.5}$$^{+0.5}$M$_{⊙}$ c$^{2}$ radiated in gravitational waves. All uncertainties define 90\% credible intervals. These observations demonstrate the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems. This is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and the first observation of a binary black hole merger.},

  abstract      = {We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array measurements of the `Cosmic Seagull', a strongly magnified galaxy at z=2.7779 behind the Bullet Cluster. We report CO(3-2) and continuum 344\~{}$\mu$m (rest-frame) data at one of the highest differential magnifications ever recorded at submillimeter wavelengths ($\mu$ up to \~{}50), facilitating a characterization of the kinematics of a rotational curve in great detail (at \~{}620 pc resolution in the source plane). We find no evidence for a decreasing rotation curve, from which we derive a dynamical mass of ($6.3\pm0.7)\times10^{10} M\_{\odot}$ within $r = 2.6\pm0.1$ kpc. The discovery of a third, unpredicted, image provides key information for a future improvement of the lensing modeling of the Bullet Cluster and allows a measure of the stellar mass, $1.6^{+1.9}\_{-0.86}\times10^{10} M\_{\odot}$, unaffected by strong differential magnification. The baryonic mass is is expected to be dominated by the molecular gas content ($f\_{gas} \leq 80 \pm 20$ $\backslash$\%) based on an $M\_{H\_2}$ mass estimated from the difference between dynamical and stellar masses. The star formation rate is estimated via the spectral energy distribution ($SFR = 190 \pm 10 M\_{\odot}/yr$), implying a molecular gas depletion time of $0.25\pm0.08$ Gyr.},

  abstract      = {The occurrence rate of tidal disruption events (TDEs) by survey missions depend on the black hole mass function of the galaxies, properties of the stellar cusp and mass of the central black hole. Using a power law density profile with Kroupa mass function, we solve the steady state Fokker-Planck to calculate the theoretical capture rate of stars by the black hole. Using a steady accretion model, the Schechter black hole mass function (BHMF) and the cosmological parameters, we calculate the detection rate of TDEs for various surveys which is then fit with the observed TDE rates to extract the Schechter parameters. The rate tension between observation ($\sim 10^{-5}~{\rm yr^{-1}}$) and theory ($\sim 10^{-4}~{\rm yr^{-1}}$) for individual galaxies is explained by the statistical average over the BHMF.},

  abstract      = {(abridged) Using the particularly long gravitational microlensing event OGLE-2014-BLG-1186 with a time-scale $t\_\mathrm{E}$ \~{} 300 d, we present a methodology for identifying the nature of localised deviations from single-lens point-source light curves, which ensures that 1) the claimed signal is substantially above the noise floor, 2) the inferred properties are robustly determined and their estimation not subject to confusion with systematic noise in the photometry, 3) there are no alternative viable solutions within the model framework that might have been missed. Annual parallax and binarity could be separated and robustly measured from the wing and the peak data, respectively. We find matching model light curves that involve either a binary lens or a binary source. Our binary-lens models indicate a planet of mass $M\_2$ = (45 $\pm$ 9) $M\_\oplus$, orbiting a star of mass $M\_1$ = (0.35 $\pm$ 0.06) $M\_\odot$, located at a distance $D\_\mathrm{L}$ = (1.7 $\pm$ 0.3) kpc from Earth, whereas our binary-source models suggest a brown-dwarf lens of $M$ = (0.046 $\pm$ 0.007) $M\_\odot$, located at a distance $D\_\mathrm{L}$ = (5.7 $\pm$ 0.9) kpc, with the source potentially being a (partially) eclipsing binary involving stars predicted to be of similar colour given the ratios between the luminosities and radii. The ambiguity in the interpretation would be resolved in favour of a lens binary by observing the luminous lens star separating from the source at the predicted proper motion of $\mu$ = (1.6 $\pm$ 0.3) mas yr$^{-1}$, whereas it would be resolved in favour of a source binary if the source could be shown to be a (partially) eclipsing binary matching the obtained model parameters. We experienced that close binary source stars pose a challenge for claiming the detection of planets by microlensing in events where the source passes very close to the lens star hosting the planet.},

Comparing the results, we find that the core formation in the halo center (which is conventionally considered as the first sign of numerical effects, to be specific, of the collisional relaxation) has nothing to do with the collisional relaxation, being defined by the properties of the tree algorithm. This result casts doubts on the universally adopted criteria of the simulation reliability in the halo center. Though we use a halo model, which is theoretically proved to be stationary and stable, a sort of numerical 'violent relaxation' occurs. Its properties suggest that this effect is highly likely responsible for the central cusp formation in cosmological modelling of the large-scale structure, and then the 'core-cusp problem' is no more than a technical problem of N-body simulations.},

For the Galactic Center case astronomers use bright stars or photons, so there are two basic observational techniques to investigate a gravitational potential, namely, (a) monitoring the orbits of bright stars near the Galactic Center as it is going on with 10m Keck twin and four 8m VLT telescopes equipped with adaptive optics facilities (in addition, recently the IR interferometer GRAVITY started to operate with VLT); (b) measuring the size and shape of shadows around black hole with VLBI-technique using telescopes operating in mm-band. At the moment, one can use a small relativistic correction approach for stellar orbit analysis, however, in the future the approximation will not be precise enough due to enormous progress of observational facilities and recently the GRAVITY team found that the first post-Newtonian correction has to be taken into account for the gravitational redshift in the S2 star orbit case. Meanwhile for smallest structure analysis in VLBI observations one really needs a strong gravitational field approximation. We discuss results of observations and their interpretations.},

  abstract = {The diffuse extragalactic background light consists of the sum of the starlight emitted by galaxies through the history of the Universe, and it could also have an important contribution from the `first stars', which may have formed before galaxy formation began. Direct measurements are difficult and not yet conclusive, owing to the large uncertainties caused by the bright foreground emission associated with zodiacal light. An alternative approach is to study the absorption features imprinted on the {$\gamma$}-ray spectra of distant extragalactic objects by interactions of those photons with the background light photons. Here we report the discovery of {$\gamma$}-ray emission from the blazars H 2356 - 309 and 1ES 1101 - 232, at redshifts z = 0.165 and z = 0.186, respectively. Their unexpectedly hard spectra provide an upper limit on the background light at optical/near-infrared wavelengths that appears to be very close to the lower limit given by the integrated light of resolved galaxies. The background flux at these wavelengths accordingly seems to be strongly dominated by the direct starlight from galaxies, thus excluding a large contribution from other sources-in particular from the first stars formed. This result also indicates that intergalactic space is more transparent to {$\gamma$}-rays than previously thought.},

We also explore the prospect of using our analysis to estimate the DM density in local substructure by setting constraints on the surface density and scale height of a thin dark disk aligned with the baryonic disk and formed due to dark matter self-interaction. Performing the statistical analysis within a Bayesian framework for three types of tracers, we obtain ${\rho\_{\rm DM}= 0.023 \pm 0.012}$ M$\_\odot$/pc$^3$ for A stars; early G stars give a similar result, while F stars yield a significantly higher value. For a thin dark disk, A stars set the strongest constraint: excluding surface densities (5-15) M$\_\odot$/pc$^2$ for scale heights below 100 pc with 95\% confidence. Comparing our results with those derived using Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) data, we find that the uncertainty in our measurements of the local DM content is dominated by systematic errors that arise from assumptions of our kinematic analysis in the low $z$ region. Furthermore, there will only be a marginal reduction in these uncertainties with more data in the Gaia era. We comment on the robustness of our method and discuss potential improvements for future work.},

  abstract = {According to the hierarchical clustering scenario, galaxies are assembled by merging and accretion of numerous satellites of different sizes and masses. This ongoing process is not 100\% efficient in destroying all of the accreted satellites, as evidenced by the satellites of our Galaxy and of M31. Using published data, we have compiled the circular velocity (V$_{circ}$) distribution function (VDF) of galaxy satellites in the Local Group. We find that within the volumes of radius of 570 kpc (400 h$^{-1}$ kpc assuming the Hubble constant1 h=0.7) centered on the Milky Way and Andromeda, the average VDF is roughly approximated as n($\gt$V$_{circ}$)\~{}55+/-11(V$_{circ}$/10 km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1.4+/-0.4}$ h$^{3}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ for V$_{circ}$ in the range \~{}10-70 km s$^{-1}$. The observed VDF is compared with results of high-resolution cosmological simulations. We find that the VDF in models is very different from the observed one: n($\gt$V$_{circ}$)\~{}1200(V$_{circ}$/10 km s$^{-1}$)$^{-2.75}$ h$^{3}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. Cosmological models thus predict that a halo the size of our Galaxy should have about 50 dark matter satellites with circular velocity greater than 20 km s$^{-1}$ and mass greater than 3{\times}10$^{8}$ M$_{solar}$ within a 570 kpc radius. This number is significantly higher than the approximately dozen satellites actually observed around our Galaxy. The difference is even larger if we consider the abundance of satellites in simulated galaxy groups similar to the Local Group. The models predict \~{}300 satellites inside a 1.5 Mpc radius, while only \~{}40 satellites are observed in the Local Group. The observed and predicted VDFs cross at \~{}50 km s$^{-1}$, indicating that the predicted abundance of satellites with V$_{circ}$$\gt$\~{}50 km s$^{-1}$ is in reasonably good agreement with observations. We conclude, therefore, that unless a large fraction of the Local Group satellites has been missed in observations, there is a dramatic discrepancy between observations and hierarchical models, regardless of the model parameters. We discuss several possible explanations for this discrepancy including identification of some satellites with the high-velocity clouds observed in the Local Group and the existence of dark satellites that failed to accrete gas and form stars either because of the expulsion of gas in the supernovae-driven winds or because of gas heating by the intergalactic ionizing background.},

  abstract = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in the standard cold dark matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fitted over two decades in radius by scaling a simple ``universal'' profile. The characteristic over- density of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way that reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii but are significantly shallower than r -2 near the center and steeper than r$^{-2}$ near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies. The first problem may imply that the core structure of dwarf galaxies was altered by the galaxy formation process, and the second problem may imply that galaxies failed to form (or remain undetected) in many dark halos.},

We study to what extent a non-zero time delay can be explained by gravitational lensing when the line of sight to the source passes near a massive object. For galaxy scale lenses, this delay becomes relevant for GWs with frequencies between $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-9}$ Hz, sourced by super massive binary black-holes. In addition to GWs detectable by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs), we expect to find also a unique and recognizable EM signal. We show that the delay between the GW and EM signal can be of the order of days to months; within reach of future observations. The effect may become important in future multi-messenger astronomy probing of gravitational propagation and interactions.},

  abstract      = {Nearby galaxy surveys have long classified X-ray binaries (XRBs) by the mass category of their donor stars (high-mass and low-mass). The NuSTAR observatory, which provides imaging data at E $\gt10$ keV, has enabled the classification of extragalactic XRBs by their compact object type: neutron star (NS) or black hole (BH). We analyzed NuSTAR/Chandra/XMM-Newton observations from a NuSTAR-selected sample of 12 galaxies within 5 Mpc having stellar masses ($M\_{\star}$) $10^{7-11}$ $M\_{\odot}$ and star formation rates (SFR) $\approx0.01-15$ $M\_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. We detect 128 NuSTAR sources to a sensitivity of $\approx10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Using NuSTAR color-intensity and color-color diagrams we classify 43 of these sources as candidate NS and 47 as candidate BH. We further subdivide BH by accretion states (soft, intermediate, and hard) and NS by weak (Z/Atoll) and strong (accreting pulsar) magnetic field. Using 8 normal (Milky Way-type) galaxies in the sample, we confirm the relation between SFR and galaxy X-ray point source luminosity in the 4-25 and 12-25 keV energy bands. We also constrain galaxy X-ray point source luminosity using the relation $L\_{\rm{X}}=\alpha M\_{\star}+\beta\text{SFR}$, finding agreement with previous work. The XLF of all sources in the 4-25 and 12-25 keV energy bands matches with the $\alpha=1.6$ slope for high-mass XRBs. We find that NS XLFs suggest a decline beginning at the Eddington limit for a 1.4 $M\_{\odot}$ NS, whereas the BH fraction shows an approximate monotonic increase in the 4-25 and 12-25keV energy bands. We calculate the overall ratio of BH to NS to be $\approx1$ for 4-25 keV and $\approx2$ for 12-25 keV.},

  abstract      = {The positions of images produced by the gravitational lensing of background sources provide unique insight in to galaxy-lens mass distribution. However, even quad images of extended sources are not able to fully characterize the central regions of the host galaxy. Most previous work has focused either on the radial density profile of the lenses or localized substructure clumps. Here, we concentrate on the azimuthal mass asymmetries near the image circle. The motivation for considering such mass inhomogeneities is that the transition between the central stellar dominated region and the outer dark matter dominated region, though well represented by a power law density profile, is unlikely to be featureless, and encodes information about the dynamical state and assembly history of galaxies. It also happens to roughly coincide with the Einstein radius. We ask if galaxies that have mass asymmetries beyond ellipticity can be modeled with simpler lenses, i.e., can complex mass distributions masquerade as simple elliptical+shear lenses? Our preliminary study indicates that for galaxies with elliptical stellar and dark matter distributions, but with no mass asymmetry, and an extended source filling the diamond caustic, an elliptical+shear lens model can reproduce the images well, thereby hiding the potential complexity of the actual mass distribution. For galaxies with non-zero mass asymmetry, the answer depends on the size and brightness distribution of the source, and its location within the diamond caustic. In roughly half of the cases we considered the mass asymmetries can easily evade detection.},

We analyze the rotation curve data from the SPARC sample, and explicitly demonstrate that both the diversity and uniformity are naturally reproduced in a hierarchical structure formation model with the addition of dark matter self-interactions. The required concentrations of the dark matter halos are fully consistent with the concentration-mass relation predicted by the Planck cosmological model. The inferred stellar mass-to-light ($3.6 \mu m$) ratios scatter around $0.5 M\_\odot/L\_\odot$, as expected from population synthesis models, leading to a tight radial acceleration relation and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. The inferred stellar-halo mass relation is consistent with the expectations from abundance matching. These results indicate that the inner dark matter halos of galaxies are thermalized due to the self-interactions of dark matter particles.},

  abstract      = {We use the Arecibo legacy fast ALFA (ALFALFA) 21cm survey to measure the number density of galaxies as a function of their rotational velocity, $V\_\mathrm{rot,HI}$ (as inferred from the width of their 21cm emission line). Based on the measured velocity function we statistically connect galaxies with their host halo, via abundance matching. In a lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology, dwarf galaxies are expected to be hosted by halos that are significantly more massive than indicated by the measured galactic velocity; if smaller halos were allowed to host galaxies, then ALFALFA would measure a much higher galactic number density. We then seek observational verification of this predicted trend by analyzing the kinematics of a literature sample of gas-rich dwarf galaxies. We find that galaxies with $V\_\mathrm{rot,HI} \lesssim 25$ $\mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ are kinematically incompatible with their predicted $\Lambda$CDM host halos, in the sense that hosts are too massive to be accommodated within the measured galactic rotation curves. This issue is analogous to the ``too big to fail'' problem faced by the bright satellites of the Milky Way, but here it concerns extreme dwarf galaxies in the field. Consequently, solutions based on satellite-specific processes are not applicable in this context. Our result confirms the findings of previous studies based on optical survey data and addresses a number of observational systematics present in these works. Furthermore, we point out the assumptions and uncertainties that could strongly affect our conclusions. We show that the two most important among them -namely baryonic effects on the abundances of halos and on the rotation curves of halos- do not seem capable of resolving the reported discrepancy.},

  abstract      = {Gravitational encounters between small-scale dark matter substructure and cold stellar streams in the Milky Way halo lead to density perturbations in the latter, making streams an effective probe for detecting dark matter substructure. The Pal 5 stream is one such system for which we have some of the best data. However, Pal 5 orbits close to the center of the Milky Way and has passed through the Galactic disk many times, where its structure can be perturbed by baryonic structures such as the Galactic bar and giant molecular clouds (GMCs). In order to understand how these baryonic structures affect Pal 5's density, we present a detailed study of the effects of the Galactic bar, spiral structure, GMCs, and globular clusters on the Pal 5 stream. We estimate the effect of each perturber on the stream density by computing its power spectrum and comparing it to the power induced by a CDM-like population of dark matter subhalos. We find that the bar, spiral structure, and GMCs can each individually create power that is comparable to the observed power on large scales, leaving little room for dark matter substructure. On degree scales, the power induced by the bar and spirals is small, but GMCs create small-scale density variations that are much larger in amplitude than the dark-matter induced variations but otherwise indistinguishable from it. These results demonstrate that Pal 5 is a poor system for constraining the dark matter substructure fraction and that observing streams further out in the halo will be necessary to confidently detect dark matter subhalos.},

  abstract      = {This work investigates the alignment of galactic spins with the cosmic web across cosmic time using the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Horizon-AGN. The cosmic web structure is extracted via the persistent skeleton as implemented in the DISPERSE algorithm. It is found that the spin of low-mass galaxies is more likely to be aligned with the filaments of the cosmic web and to lie within the plane of the walls while more massive galaxies tend to have a spin perpendicular to the axis of the filaments and to the walls. The mass transition is detected with a significance of 9 sigmas. This galactic alignment is consistent with the alignment of the spin of dark haloes found in pure dark matter simulations and with predictions from (anisotropic) tidal torque theory. However, unlike haloes, the alignment of low-mass galaxies is weak and disappears at low redshifts while the orthogonal spin orientation of massive galaxies is strong and increases with time, probably as a result of mergers. At fixed mass, alignments are correlated with galaxy morphology: the high-redshift alignment is dominated by spiral galaxies while elliptical centrals are mainly responsible for the perpendicular signal. These predictions for spin alignments with respect to cosmic filaments and unprecendently walls are successfully compared with existing observations. The alignment of the shape of galaxies with the different components of the cosmic web is also investigated. A coherent and stronger signal is found in terms of shape at high mass. The two regimes probed in this work induce competing galactic alignment signals for weak lensing, with opposite redshift and luminosity evolution. Understanding the details of these intrinsic alignments will be key to exploit future major cosmic shear surveys like Euclid or LSST.},

To illustrate our approach, we fit this model to the luminosity distribution of both classical MW satellites and those discovered in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey by performing realistic mock observations that depend on the luminosity, size, and distance of our predicted satellites, and we infer the total satellite population that will be probed by upcoming surveys. We argue that galaxy size and surface brightness modeling will play a key role in interpreting current and future observations, as the expected number of observable satellites depends sensitively on their surface brightness distribution.},

  abstract      = {In simulations of binary neutron star mergers, the dense matter equation of state (EOS) is required over wide ranges of density and temperature as well as under conditions in which neutrinos are trapped, and the effects of magnetic fields and rotation prevail. Here we assess the status of dense matter theory and point out the successes and limitations of approaches currently in use. A comparative study of the excluded volume (EV) and virial approaches for the $np\alpha$ system using the equation of state of Akmal, Pandharipande and Ravenhall for interacting nucleons is presented in the sub-nuclear density regime. Owing to the excluded volume of the $\alpha$-particles, their mass fraction vanishes in the EV approach below the baryon density 0.1 fm$^{-3}$, whereas it continues to rise due to the predominantly attractive interactions in the virial approach. The EV approach of Lattimer et al. is extended here to include clusters of light nuclei such as d, $^3$H and $^3$He in addition to $\alpha$-particles. Results of the relevant state variables from this development are presented and enable comparisons with related but slightly different approaches in the literature. We also comment on some of the sweet and sour aspects of the supra-nuclear EOS. The extent to which the gravitational and baryon masses vary due to thermal effects, neutrino trapping, magnetic fields and rotation are summarized from earlier studies in which the effects from each of these sources were considered separately. Increases of about 25$\backslash$\% (50$\backslash$\%) occur for rigid (differential) rotation with comparable increases occurring in the presence of magnetic fields only for fields in excess of $10^{18}$ Gauss. Comparatively smaller changes occur due to thermal effects and neutrino trapping. Some future studies to gain further insight into the outcome of dynamical simulations are suggested.},

  abstract      = {High mass galaxies, with halo masses $M\_{200} \ge 10^{10} M\_{\odot}$, reveal a remarkable near-linear relation between their globular cluster (GC) system mass and their host galaxy halo mass. Extending this relation to the mass range of dwarf galaxies has been problematic due to the difficulty in measuring independent halo masses. Here we derive new halo masses based on stellar and HI gas kinematics for a sample of nearby dwarf galaxies with GC systems. We find that the GC system mass--halo mass relation for galaxies populated by GCs holds from halo masses of $M\_{200} \sim 10^{14} M\_{\odot}$ down to below $M\_{200}$ $\sim 10^9 M\_{\odot}$, although there is a substantial increase in scatter towards low masses. In particular, three well-studied ultra diffuse galaxies, with dwarf-like stellar masses, reveal a wide range in their GC-to-halo mass ratios. We compare our GC system--halo mass relation to the recent model of El Badry et al., finding that their fiducial model does not reproduce our data in the low mass regime. This may suggest that GC formation needs to be more efficient than assumed in their model, or it may be due to the onset of stochastic GC occupation in low mass halos. Finally, we briefly discuss the stellar mass-halo mass relation for our low mass galaxies with GCs, and we suggest some nearby dwarf galaxies for which searches for GCs may be fruitful.},

  abstract      = {We study the orbital evolution of black hole (BH) binaries in quadruple systems, where the tertiary binary excites large eccentricity in the BH binary through Lidov-Kozai (LK) oscillations, causing the binary BHs to merge via gravitational radiation. We show that binary-binary interactions can significantly increase the LK window for mergers (the range of companion inclinations that allows the BH binary to merge within 10\~{}Gyrs). This increase arises from a secular resonance between the LK oscillation of the BH binary and the nodal precession of the outer (binary-binary) orbit driven by the tertiary binary. Therefore, in the presence of tertiary binary, the BH merger fraction is increased to $10-30\\%$, an order of magnitude larger than the merger fraction found in similar triple systems. Since the occurrence rate of stellar quadruples in the galactic fields is not much smaller than that of stellar triples, our result suggests that dynamically induced BH mergers in quadruple systems may be an important channel of producing BH mergers observed by LIGO/VIRGO.},

  abstract      = {We consider the total nonlocal energy associated with a particle at rest in the Hubble flow, i.e., the relational energy between this particle and all connected particles within the causal horizon. The particle, even while at rest, partakes in relative recessional and peculiar motion of connected particles in 3 dimensions. A geometrical argument due to Berkeley suggests that the nonlocal mass of recessional energy associated with the particle is 3 times its Newtonian mass. It follows that nonlocal recessional and peculiar energy of the Universe are equal, and match Misner-Sharp energy within the apparent horizon. Contributions of recessional and peculiar nonlocal energy are thus shown to generate a 6 times higher level of matter energy than expected from the Newtonian mass. Accordingly, the nonlocal energy density of baryons is expected to be 6 times the standard local energy density of baryons, i.e., $\Omega\_{\textrm{b,eff}}=6\Omega\_{\textrm{b}}$. At $\Omega\_{\textrm{b}}\sim0.0484\pm0.0017$ (Planck 2015 results) this predicts a nonlocal baryon energy density $\Omega\_{\textrm{b,eff}}\sim0.290\pm0.010$, in agreement with observed matter density $\Omega\_{\textrm{m}}\sim0.308\pm0.012$.
