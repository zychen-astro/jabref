  abstract      = {The precise localization of the repeating fast radio burst (FRB 121102) has provided the first unambiguous association (chance coincidence probability p {\lsim} 3 {\times} 10$^{-4}$) of an FRB with an optical and persistent radio counterpart. We report on optical imaging and spectroscopy of the counterpart and find that it is an extended (0.{\Prime}6-0.{\Prime}8) object displaying prominent Balmer and [O III] emission lines. Based on the spectrum and emission line ratios, we classify the counterpart as a low-metallicity, star-forming, m $_{ r‧}$ = 25.1 AB mag dwarf galaxy at a redshift of z = 0.19273(8), corresponding to a luminosity distance of 972 Mpc. From the angular size, the redshift, and luminosity, we estimate the host galaxy to have a diameter {\lsim}4 kpc and a stellar mass of M $_{*}$ {\tilde} (4-7) {\times} 10$^{7}$ M $_{⊙}$, assuming a mass-to-light ratio between 2 to 3 M $_{⊙}$ L $_{⊙}$ $^{-1}$. Based on the H{$\alpha$} flux, we estimate the star formation rate of the host to be 0.4 M $_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$ and a substantial host dispersion measure (DM) depth {\lsim}324 pc cm$^{-3}$. The net DM contribution of the host galaxy to FRB 121102 is likely to be lower than this value depending on geometrical factors. We show that the persistent radio source at FRB 121102{\rsquo}s location reported by Marcote et al. is offset from the galaxy{\rsquo}s center of light by {\tilde}200 mas and the host galaxy does not show optical signatures for AGN activity. If FRB 121102 is typical of the wider FRB population and if future interferometric localizations preferentially find them in dwarf galaxies with low metallicities and prominent emission lines, they would share such a preference with long gamma-ray bursts and superluminous supernovae.},

  title       = {The Fermi bubbles from stochastic acceleration of electrons in a Galactic outflow},
  abstract    = {The discovery of the Fermi bubbles---a huge bilobular structure seen in GeV gamma-rays above and below the Galactic center---implies the presence of a large reservoir of high energy particles at $\sim 10 \, \text{kpc}$ from the disk. The absence of evidence for a strong shock coinciding with the edge of the bubbles, and constraints from multi-wavelength observations point towards stochastic acceleration by turbulence as a likely mechanism of acceleration. We have investigated the time-dependent acceleration of electrons in a large-scale outflow from the Galactic centre. For the first time, we present a detailed numerical solution of the particle kinetic equation that includes the acceleration, transport and relevant energy loss processes. We also take into account the addition of shock acceleration of electrons at the bubble's blast wave. Fitting to the observed spectrum and surface brightness distribution of the bubbles allows determining the transport coefficients, thereby shedding light on the origin of the Fermi bubbles.},

  abstract      = {The interplay between charged particles and turbulent magnetic fields is crucial to understanding how cosmic rays propagate through space. A key parameter which controls this interplay is the ratio of the particle gyroradius to the correlation length of the magnetic turbulence. For the vast majority of cosmic rays detected at the Earth, this parameter is small, and the particles are well confined by the Galactic magnetic field. But for cosmic rays more energetic than about 30 EeV, this parameter is large. These highest energy particles are not confined to the Milky Way and are presumed to be extragalactic in origin. Identifying their sources requires understanding how they are deflected by the intergalactic magnetic field, which appears to be weak, turbulent with an unknown correlation length, and possibly spatially intermittent. This is particularly relevant given the recent detection by the Pierre Auger Observatory of a significant dipole anisotropy in the arrival directions of cosmic rays of energy above 8 EeV. Here we report measurements of energetic-particle propagation through a random magnetic field in a laser-produced plasma. We characterize the diffusive transport of these particles and recover experimentally pitch-angle scattering measurements and extrapolate to find their mean free path and the associated diffusion coefficient, which show scaling-relations consistent with theoretical studies. This experiment validates these theoretical tools for analyzing the propagation of ultra-high energy cosmic rays through the intergalactic medium.},

  abstract      = {Relativistic jets are observed throughout the Universe, strongly impacting their surrounding environments on all physical scales, from Galactic binary systems to galaxies and galaxy clusters. An important avenue to understand the formation of these jets is by characterising the systems and circumstances from which they are launched. Whenever a black hole or neutron star accretes matter, it appears to inevitably result in the launching of a jet, the only exception being the most common type of accreting neutron stars: those with strong ($B \geq 10^{12}$ G) magnetic fields. This exception has created the paradigm that strong magnetic fields inhibit the formation of jets. Here, we report the discovery of a jet launched by a strongly-magnetised neutron star that is accreting above the Eddington limit, disproving this long-standing paradigm. The radio luminosity of the jet is two orders of magnitude fainter than seen in other neutron stars, implying an important role for the neutron star's properties in regulating jet power. This jet detection necessitates fundamental revision of current neutron star jet models and opens up new tests of jet theory for all accreting systems. It also shows that the strong magnetic fields of ultra-luminous X-ray pulsars do not prevent such sources from launching jets.},
