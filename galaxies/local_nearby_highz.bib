  abstract      = {We present a study of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using \~{}2.2 million red clump (RC) stars selected from the Survey of the MAgellanic Stellar History (SMASH). To correct for line-of-sight dust extinction, the intrinsic RC color and magnitude and their radial dependence are carefully measured by using internal nearly dust-free regions. These are then used to construct an accurate 2D reddening map (165 square degrees with \~{}10 arcmin resolution) of the LMC disk and the 3D spatial distribution of RC stars. An inclined disk model is fit to the 2D distance map yielding a best-fit inclination angle i = 25.86(+0.73,-1.39) degrees with random errors of +$\backslash$-0.19 degrees, line-of-nodes position angle theta = 149.23(+6.43,-8.35) degrees with random errors of +/-0.49 degrees. These angles vary with galactic radius, indicating that the LMC disk is warped and twisted likely due to the repeated tidal interactions with the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). For the first time, our data reveal a significant warp in the southwest of the outer disk starting at rho \~{} 7 degrees that departs from the defined LMC plane up to \~{}4 kpc towards the SMC, suggesting that it originated from a strong interaction with the SMC. In addition, the inner disk encompassing the off-centered bar appears to be tilted up to 5-15 degrees relative to the rest of the LMC disk. These findings on the outer warp and the tilted bar are consistent with the predictions from the Besla et al. (2012) simulation of a recent direct collision with the SMC.},

  abstract      = {We present results of the first dynamical stream fits to the recently discovered Tucana III stream. These fits assume a fixed Milky Way potential and give proper motion predictions, which can be tested with the upcoming Gaia Data Release 2. These fits reveal that Tucana III is on an eccentric orbit around the Milky Way and, more interestingly, that Tucana III passed within 15 kpc of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) approximately 75 Myr ago. Given this close passage, we fit the Tucana III stream in the combined presence of the Milky Way and the LMC. We find that the predicted proper motions depend on the assumed mass of the LMC and that the LMC can induce a substantial proper motion perpendicular to the stream track. A detection of this misalignment will directly probe the extent of the LMC's influence on our Galaxy, and has implications for nearly all methods which attempt to constraint the Milky Way potential. Such a measurement will be possible with the upcoming Gaia DR2, allowing for a measurement of the LMC's mass.},

  abstract      = {We present a spectroscopic study of the tidal tails and core of the Milky Way satellite Tucana III, collectively referred to as the Tucana III stream, using the 2dF+AAOmega spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope and the IMACS spectrograph on the Magellan/Baade Telescope. In addition to recovering the brightest 9 previously known member stars in the Tucana III core, we identify 22 members in the tidal tails. We observe strong evidence for a velocity gradient of 8.0 km/s/deg (or 18.3 km/s/kpc over at least 3$^{\circ}$ (or 1.3 kpc) on the sky. Based on the continuity in velocity we confirm that the Tucana III tails are real tidal extensions of Tucana III. The large velocity gradient of the stream implies that Tucana III is likely on a radial orbit. We successfully obtain metallicities for 4 members in the core and 12 members in the tails. We find that members close to the ends of the stream tend to be more metal-poor than members in the core, indicating a possible metallicity gradient between the center of the progenitor halo and its edge. The spread in metallicity suggests that the progenitor of the Tucana III stream is a dwarf galaxy rather than a star cluster. Furthermore, we find that with the precise photometry of the Dark Energy Survey data, there is a discernible color offset between metal-rich disk stars and metal-poor stream members. This metallicity-dependent color offers a more efficient method to recognize metal-poor targets and will increase the selection efficiency of stream members for future spectroscopic follow-up programs on stellar streams.},

  abstract    = {We present a search for new members of the 300 \kms\ stream (300S) near the dwarf galaxy Segue 1 using wide-field survey data. We identify 11 previously unknown bright stream members in the APOGEE-2 and SEGUE-1 and 2 spectroscopic surveys. Based on the spatial distribution of the high-velocity stars, we confirm for the first time that this kinematic structure is associated with a 24\degr-long stream seen in SDSS and Pan-STARRS imaging data. The 300S stars display a metallicity range of $-2.17 < {\rm [Fe/H]} < -1.24$, with an intrinsic dispersion of 0.21$_{-0.09}^{+0.12}$ dex. They also have chemical abundance patterns similar to those of Local Group dwarf galaxies, as well as that of the Milky Way halo. Using the open-source code \textit{galpy} to model the orbit of the stream, we find that the progenitor of the stream passed perigalacticon about 70 Myr ago, with a closest approach to the Galactic Center of about 4.5 kpc. Thus, 300S may be the most recent Milky Way satellite to be tidally disrupted. Using Pan-STARRS DR1 data, we obtain an integrated stream luminosity of $4 \times 10^3$ L$_{\odot}$. We conclude that the progenitor of the stream was a dwarf galaxy that is probably similar to the satellites that were accreted to build the present-day Milky Way halo.},

  abstract    = {We present for the first time extended stellar density and/or surface brightness radial profiles for almost all the known Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) old globular clusters (GCs). These were built from DECam images and reach out to ~ 4 times the GCs' tidal radii. The background subtracted radial profiles reveal that the GCs located closer than ~ 5 kpc from the LMC centre contain an excess of stars in their outermost regions with respect to the stellar density expected from a King profile. Such a residual amount of stars - not seen in GCs located farther than ~ 5 kpc from the LMC centre-, as well as the GCs' dimensions, show a clear dependence with the GCs' positions in the galaxy, in the sense that, the farther the GC from the centre of the LMC, the larger both the excess of stars in its outskirts and size. Although the masses of GCs located inside and outside ~ 5 kpc are commensurate, the outermost regions of GCs located closer than ~ 5 kpc from the LMC centre appear to have dynamically evolved more quickly. These outcomes can be fully interpreted in the light of the known GC radial velocity disc-like kinematics, from which GCs have been somehow mostly experiencing the influence of the LMC gravitational field at their respective mean distances from the LMC centre.},

The polarization vectors are used to identify the orientation of the magnetic field projected on the plane of the sky at a resolution of 0.01 pc. We identify 10 subregions with distinct polarization fractions and angles in the 0.2 pc $\rho$ Oph A core; some of them can be part of a coherent magnetic field structure in the $\rho$ Oph region. The results are consistent with previous observations of the brightest regions of $\rho$ Oph-A, where the degrees of polarization are at a level of a few percents, but our data reveal for the first time the magnetic field structures in the fainter regions surrounding the core where the degree of polarization is much higher ($> 5 \%$). A comparison with previous near-infrared polarimetric data shows that there are several magnetic field components which are consistent at near-infrared and submillimeter wavelengths. Using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, we also derive magnetic field strengths in several sub-core regions, which range from approximately 0.2 to 5 mG. We also find a correlation between the magnetic field orientations projected on the sky with the core centroid velocity components.},

Using data from the Catalina Rapid Transient Survey and the All Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, we extract a clean sample of $\sim 2,400$ O-Miras, stretching from the Galactic Bulge to the distant halo. Given that the period of O-Miras correlates with age, this offers a new way of determining age gradients throughout the Galaxy. We use our sample to show (i) disk O-Miras have periods increasing on moving outwards from ~ 3 to 15 kpc, so the outer disk O-Miras are younger than the inner disk, (ii) the transition from younger disk to halo O-Miras occurs at r ~ 15 kpc and is marked by a plummeting in period, (iii) there exists a population of young O-Miras likely kicked from the disk to heights of order of |Z| ~ 10 kpc, (iv) great circle counts of old Miras show strong evidence for distant debris agglomeration associated with the Magellanic Clouds, (v) seven stars in our samples are located at distances between 200 and 500 kpc surpassing all previously established records, and, finally, (vi) O-Miras may be present in the Fornax, Sculptor, Sextans and Leo II Galactic dwarf spheroidals, as well as the distant globular cluster Pal 4. We spotlight the importance of O-Mira in the Era of Gaia as universal chronometers of the Galactic populations.},

HVS3 is highly likely to be coming almost from the centre of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). During its closest approach, $21.1^{+6.1}_{-4.6}$ Myr ago, it had a relative velocity of $870^{+69}_{-66}$ kms$^{-1}$ with respect to the LMC. This large kick velocity is only consistent with the Hills mechanism, requiring a massive black hole at the centre of the LMC. This provides strong direct evidence that the LMC itself harbours a massive black hole of at least $4\times 10^3 -10^4 M_\odot$.},

  title       = {Wrinkles in the Gaia data unveil a dynamically young and perturbed Milky Way disk},
  abstract    = {Most of the stars in our Galaxy including our Sun, move in a disk-like component and give the Milky Way its characteristic appearance on the night sky. As in all fields in science, motions can be used to reveal the underlying forces, and in the case of disk stars they provide important diagnostics on the structure and history of the Galaxy. But because of the challenges involved in measuring stellar motions, samples have so far remained limited in their number of stars, precision and spatial extent. This has changed dramatically with the second Data Release of the Gaia mission which has just become available. Here we report that the phase space distribution of stars in the disk of the Milky Way is full of substructure with a variety of morphologies, most of which have never been observed before. This includes shapes such as arches and shells in velocity space, and snail shells and ridges when spatial and velocity coordinates are combined. The nature of these substructures implies that the disk is phase mixing from an out of equilibrium state, and that the Galactic bar and/or spiral structure are strongly affecting the orbits of disk stars. Our analysis of the features leads us to infer that the disk was perturbed between 300 and 900 Myr ago, which matches current estimations of the previous pericentric passage of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. The Gaia data challenge the most basic premise of stellar dynamics of dynamical equilibrium, and show that modelling the Galactic disk as a time-independent axisymmetric component is definitively incorrect. These findings mark the start of a new era when, by modelling the richness of phase space substructures, we can determine the gravitational potential of the Galaxy, its time evolution and the characteristics of the perturbers that have most influenced our home in the Universe.},

  title       = {The stellar velocity dispersion in nearby spirals: radial profiles and correlations},
  abstract    = {The stellar velocity dispersion, $\sigma$, is a quantity of crucial importance for spiral galaxies, where it enters fundamental dynamical processes such as gravitational instability and disc heating. Here we analyse a sample of 34 nearby spirals from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) spectroscopic survey, and present reliable radial profiles of $\sigma_{R}$ as well as accurate measurements of $\langle\sigma_{R}\rangle$, the radial average of $\sigma_{R}$ over one effective (half-light) radius. We show that there is a trend for $\sigma_{R}$ to increase with decreasing $R$, consistent with a process of disc heating mediated by local gravitational instabilities and radial inflow, and that $\langle\sigma_{R}\rangle$ correlates with stellar mass ($M_{\star}$), molecular gas mass ($M_{\mathrm{mol}}$), star formation rate ($\mathrm{SFR}$) and other galaxy properties. The most significant and strongest correlation is the one with $M_{\star}$: $\log\langle\sigma_{R}\rangle = 0.45\,\log(M_{\star}/\mbox{M}_{\odot})-2.77\;[\mbox{km\,s}^{-1}]$, which has a rms scatter of 0.10 dex (26%). This tight scaling relation is applicable to spiral galaxies of type Sa--Sd and stellar mass $M_{\star}\approx10^{9.5}\mbox{--}10^{11.5}\ \mbox{M}_{\odot}$. Simple models that relate $\sigma_{R}$ to the stellar surface density and disc scale length roughly reproduce that scaling, but overestimate $\langle\sigma_{R}\rangle$ significantly.},

We refer to them as "Bright, Compact Bulges" (BCBs) - they resemble neither classical nor pseudo-bulges and constitute $\sim12$% of the total bulge population at these redshifts. Examining free-bulge $+$ disc decomposition sample and elliptical galaxy sample from Simard et al. (2011), we find that only $\sim0.2$% of the bulges can be classified as BCBs in the local Universe. Bulge to total ratio $(B/T)$ of disc galaxies with BCBs is (at $\sim0.4$) a factor of $\sim2$ and $\sim4$ larger than for those with classical and pseudo bulges. BCBs are $\sim2.5$ and $\sim6$ times more massive than classical and pseudo bulges. Although disc galaxies with BCBs host the most massive and dominant bulge type, their specific star formation rate is $1.5-2$ times higher than other disc galaxies. This is contrary to the expectations that a massive compact bulge would lead to lower star formation rates. We speculate that our BCB host disc galaxies are descendant of massive, compact and passive elliptical galaxies observed at higher redshifts. Those high redshift ellipticals lack local counterparts and possibly evolved by acquiring a compact disc around them. The overall properties of BCBs supports a picture of galaxy assembly in which younger discs are being accreted around massive pre-existing spheroids.},

  title       = {Exploring the thermal energy contents of the intergalactic medium with the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect},
  abstract    = {We examine the thermal energy contents of the intergalactic medium (IGM) over three orders of magnitude in both mass density and gas temperature using thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (tSZE). The analysis is based on {\it Planck} tSZE map and the cosmic density field, reconstructed for the SDSS DR7 volume and sampled on a grid of cubic cells of $(1h^{-1}{\rm Mpc})^3$, together with a matched filter technique employed to maximize the signal-to-noise. Our results show that the pressure - density relation of the IGM is roughly a power law given by an adiabatic equation of state, with an indication of steepening at densities higher than about $10$ times the mean density of the universe. The implied average gas temperature is $\sim 10^4\,{\rm K}$ in regions of mean density, $\rho_{\rm m} \sim {\overline\rho}_{\rm m}$, increasing to about $10^5\,{\rm K}$ for $\rho_{\rm m} \sim 10\,{\overline\rho}_{\rm m}$, and to $>10^{6}\,{\rm K}$ for $\rho_{\rm m} \sim 100\,{\overline\rho}_{\rm m}$. At a given density, the thermal energy content of the IGM is also found to be higher in regions of stronger tidal fields, likely due to shock heating by the formation of large scale structure and/or feedback from galaxies and AGNs. A comparison of the results with hydrodynamic simulations suggests that the current data can already provide interesting constraints on galaxy formation.},

We use UV absorption-line spectra from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on the Hubble Space Telescope to probe the southern Fermi Bubble using a sample of 17 background AGN projected behind or near the Bubble. We measure the incidence of high-velocity clouds (HVC), finding that four out of six sightlines passing through the Bubble show HVC absorption, versus six out of eleven passing outside. We find strong evidence that the maximum absolute LSR velocity of the HVC components decreases as a function of galactic latitude within the Bubble, for both blueshifted and redshifted components, as expected for a decelerating outflow. We explore whether the column-density ratios SiIV/SiIII, SiIV/SiII and SiIII/SiII correlate with the absolute galactic latitude within the Bubble. These results demonstrate the use of UV absorption-line spectroscopy to characterize the kinematics and ionization conditions of embedded clouds in the Galactic Center outflow.},

  abstract      = {The most likely origin of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) is the tidal disruption of a binary star by the supermassive black hole (MBH) in the Galactic Centre (GC). However, HE0437-5439, a $9$ M$\_\odot$ B-type main-sequence star moving with a heliocentric radial velocity of about $720$ km s$^{-1}$ at a distance of $\sim 60$ kpc, and the recent discovered hypervelocity binary candidate (HVB), traveling at $\sim 570$ km s$^{-1}$, challenge this standard scenario. Recently, Fragione {\amp} Gualandris (2018) have demonstrated that the tidal breakup of a triple star leads to an insufficient rate. Observations show that quadruple stars made up of two binaries orbiting their common center of mass (the so-called 2+2 quadruples) are $\approx 4\\%$ of the stars in the solar neighborhood. Although rarer than triples, 2+2 quadruple stars may have a role in ejecting HVBs as due to their larger energy reservoir. We present a numerical study of 2+2 quadruple disruptions by the MBH in the GC and find that the production of HVBs has a probability $\lesssim 2-4\\%$, which translates into an ejection rate of $\lesssim 1$ Gyr$^{-1}$, comparable to the triple disruption scenario. Given the low ejection rate, we suggest that alternative mechanisms are responsible for the origin of HVBs, as the ejection from the interaction of a young star cluster with the MBH in the GC and the origin in the Large Magellanic Cloud.},

I present proper motion measurements based on Gaia DR2 for 17 ultra-faint dwarf galaxies within 100 kpc of the Milky Way. I compile the spectroscopically-confirmed member stars in each dwarf bright enough for Gaia astrometry from the literature, producing member samples ranging from 2 stars in Triangulum II to 68 stars in Bootes I. From the spectroscopic member catalogs I estimate the proper motion of each system. I find good agreement with the proper motions derived by the Gaia collaboration for Bootes I and Leo I. The tangential velocities for 14 of the 17 dwarfs are determined to better than 50 km/s, more than doubling the sample of such measurements for Milky Way satellite galaxies. The orbital pericenters are well-constrained, with a median value of 38 kpc. Only one satellite, Tucana III, is on an orbit passing within 15 kpc of the Galactic center, suggesting that the remaining ultra-faint dwarfs are unlikely to have experienced severe tidal stripping. As a group, the ultra-faint dwarfs are on high-velocity, eccentric, retrograde trajectories, with nearly all of them having space motions exceeding 370 km/s. In the default low-mass Milky Way potential I assume, eight out of the 17 galaxies lack well-defined apocenters and appear likely to be on their first infall, indicating that the Milky Way mass may be larger than previously estimated or that many of the ultra-faint dwarfs are associated with the Magellanic Clouds. The median eccentricity of the ultra-faint dwarf orbits is 0.79, similar to the values seen in numerical simulations, but distinct from the rounder orbits of the more luminous dwarf spheroidals.},

  abstract      = {The physics of core-collapse (CC) supernovae (SNe) and how the explosions depend on progenitor properties are central questions in astronomy. For only a handful of SNe, the progenitor star has been identified in pre-explosion images. Supernova remnants (SNRs), which are observed long after the original SN event, provide a unique opportunity to increase the number of progenitor measurements. Here, we systematically examine the stellar populations in the vicinities of 23 known SNRs in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using the star formation history (SFH) maps of Harris {\amp} Zaritsky (2004). We combine the results with constraints on the SNR metal abundances and environment from X-ray and optical observations. We find that 22 SNRs in the SMC have local SFHs and properties consistent with a CC explosion, several of which are likely to have been high-mass progenitors. This result supports recent theoretical findings that high-mass progenitors can produce successful explosions. We estimate the mass distribution of the CC progenitors and find that this distribution is similar to a Salpeter IMF (within the uncertainties), while this result is shallower than the mass distribution found in M31 and M33 by Jennings et al. (2014) and D$\backslash$'$\{$$\backslash$i$\}$az-Rodr$\backslash$'$\{$$\backslash$i$\}$guez et al. (2018) using a similar approach. Additionally, we find that a number of the SMC SNRs exhibit a burst of star formation between 50--200 Myr ago. As these sources are likely CC, this signature may be indicative of massive stars undergoing delayed CC as a consequence of the low metallicity or due to binary interaction. In addition, the lack of Type Ia SNRs in the SMC is possibly a result of the short visibility times of these sources as they may fall below the sensitivity limits of current radio observations.},

Some of these structures were previously-known, several are new discoveries, but others are potentially artefacts of the Gaia scanning law and will require confirmation.

Statistical reddening and distance modulus free from the effect of reddening to each of the individual Cepheids are obtained using the simultaneous multi-band fit to the apparent distance moduli from the analysis of the resulting Leavitt laws in these seven photometric bands. A reddening map of the LMC obtained from the analysis shows good agreement with the other maps available in the literature. Extinction free distance measurements along with the information of the equatorial coordinates $(\alpha,\delta)$ for individual stars are used to obtain the corresponding Cartesian coordinates with respect to the plane of the sky. By fitting a plane solution of the form $z=f(x,y)$ to the observed three dimensional distribution, the following viewing angle parameters of the LMC are obtained: inclination angle $i=25^{\circ}.110\pm 0^{\circ}.365$, position angle of line of nodes $\theta\_{\text{lon}}=154^{\circ}.702\pm1^{\circ}.378$. On the other hand, modelling the observed three dimensional distribution of the Cepheids as a triaxial ellipsoid, the following values of the geometrical axes ratios of the LMC are obtained: $1.000\pm 0.003:1.151\pm0.003:1.890\pm 0.014$ with the viewing angle parameters: inclination angle of $i=11^{\circ}.920\pm 0^{\circ}.315$ with respect to the longest axis from the line of sight and position angle of line of nodes $\theta\_{\rm lon} = 128^{\circ}.871\pm 0^{\circ}.569$.

  title       = {The central velocity dispersion of the Milky Way bulge},
  abstract    = {Recent spectroscopic and photometric surveys are providing a comprehensive view of the MW bulge stellar population properties with unprecedented accuracy. This in turn allows us to explore the correlation between kinematics and stellar density distribution, crucial to constraint the models of Galactic bulge formation. GIBS revealed the presence of a velocity dispersion peak in the central few degrees of the Galaxy by consistently measuring high velocity dispersion in three central most fields. Due to suboptimal distribution of these fields, all being at negative latitudes and close to each other, the shape and extension of the sigma peak is poorly constrained. In this study we address this by adding new observations distributed more uniformly and in particular including fields at positive latitudes that were missing in GIBS.MUSE observations were collected in four fields at (l,b)=(0,+2),(0,-2),(+1,-1),(-1,+2). Individual stellar spectra were extracted for a number of stars comprised between ~500 and ~1200, depending on the seeing and the exposure time. Velocity measurements are done by cross-correlating observed stellar spectra in the CaT region with a synthetic template, and velocity errors obtained through Monte Carlo simulations, cross-correlating synthetic spectra with a range of different metallicities and different noise characteristics. We measure the central velocity dispersion peak within a projected distance from the Galactic center of ~280pc, reaching sigma~140 km/s at b=-1. This is in agreement with the results obtained previously by GIBS at negative longitude. The central sigma peak is symmetric with respect to the Galactic plane, with a longitude extension at least as narrow as predicted by GIBS. As a result of the Monte Carlo simulations we present analytical equations for the Rvel measurement error as a function of metallicity and SNR for giant and dwarf stars.},

  abstract = {Using semi-analytic models of galaxy formation set within the cold dark matter (CDM) merging hierarchy, we investigate several scenarios for the nature of the high-redshift z{\gsim} 2) Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs). We consider a `collisional starburst' model in which bursts of star formation are triggered by galaxy-galaxy mergers, and find that a significant fraction of LBGs are predicted to be starbursts. This model reproduces the observed comoving number density of bright LBGs as a function of redshift and the observed luminosity function at z{\tilde} 3 and z{\tilde} 4, with a reasonable amount of dust extinction. Model galaxies at z{\tilde} 3 have star formation rates, half-light radii, I-K colours and internal velocity dispersions that are in good agreement with the data. Global quantities such as the star formation rate density and cold gas and metal content of the Universe as a function of redshift also agree well. Two `quiescent' models without starbursts are also investigated. In one, the star formation efficiency in galaxies remains constant with redshift, while in the other, it scales inversely with disc dynamical time, and thus increases rapidly with redshift. The first quiescent model is strongly ruled out, as it does not produce enough high-redshift galaxies once realistic dust extinction is accounted for. The second quiescent model fits marginally, but underproduces cold gas and very bright galaxies at high redshift. A general conclusion is that star formation at high redshift must be more efficient than locally. The collisional starburst model appears to accomplish this naturally without violating other observational constraints.},

The recent discovery of several ultra-faint dwarf galaxy candidates in close proximity to the Magellanic Clouds provides a unique opportunity to test this theory. Specifically, proper motions provide a stringent test, because material that is associated with the Large Magellanic Cloud prior to infall should retain its direction of orbital angular momentum. We present proper motion measurements for 13 of the 32 newly discovered dwarf galaxy candidates using Gaia data release 2. All 13 also have radial velocity measurements. We compare the measured 3D velocities of these dwarfs to those expected at the corresponding distance and location for the debris of an LMC analog in a numerical simulation. We conclude that 4 of these galaxies (Hor1, Car2, Car3 and Hyd1) have come in with the Magellanic Cloud system, constituting the first confirmation of the type of satellite infall predicted by LCDM. Ret2, Tuc2 and Gru1 have some velocity components that are not consistent within 3 sigma of our predictions and are therefore less favorable. Hyd2 and Dra2 could be associated with the LMC and merit further attention. We rule out Tuc3, Cra2, Tri2 and Aqu2 as potential members. Of the dwarfs without measured PMs, 6 of them are deemed unlikely on the basis of their positions and distances alone which put them too far from the orbital plane expected for LMC debris (Eri2, Ind2, Cet2, Tri2, Cet3 and Vir1). For the remaining sample, we use the simulation to predict proper motions and radial velocities, finding that Phx2 has an overdensity of stars in DR2 consistent with this PM prediction. If its radial velocity is confirmed at $\sim -15$ km s$^{-1}, it is also likely a member.},

  abstract      = {We estimate the mass of the Milky Way and the axis ratio of its dark matter halo using globular clusters as tracers. At the same time, we constrain the phase-space distribution of the globular cluster system. We use the Gaia DR2 catalogue of 75 globular clusters' proper motions and recent measurements of the proper motions of another 20 distant clusters obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. We describe the globular cluster system with a 2-component distribution function (DF), with a flat, rotating disc and a rounder, more extended halo. While fixing the Milky Way's disc and bulge, we let the mass and shape of the dark matter halo and we fit these two parameters, together with other six describing the DF, with a Bayesian method. We find the mass of the Galaxy within 20 kpc to be $M(\lt20{\,\rm kpc})=1.91^{+0.17}\_{-0.15} \times 10^{11} M\_\odot$, of which $M\_{\rm DM}(\lt20{\,\rm kpc})=1.37^{+0.12}\_{-0.11}\times 10^{11} M\_\odot$ is in dark matter, and the density axis ratio of the dark matter halo to be $q=1.30 \pm 0.25$. This implies a virial mass $M\_{\rm vir} = 1.3 \pm 0.3 \times 10^{12}M\_\odot$. Our analysis rules out oblate ($q\lt0.8$) and strongly prolate halos ($q\gt1.9$) with 99$\backslash$\% probability. Our preferred model reproduces well the observed phase-space distribution of globular clusters and has a disc component that closely resembles that of the Galactic thick disc. The halo component follows a power-law density profile $\rho \propto r^{-3.3}$, has a mean rotational velocity of $V\_{\rm rot}\simeq -14\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$ at 20 kpc, and has a mildly radially biased velocity distribution ($\beta\simeq 0.2 \pm 0.07$, that varies significantly with radius only within the inner 15 kpc). We also find that our distinction between disc and halo clusters resembles, although not fully, the observed distinction in metal-rich ([Fe/H]$\gt-0.8$) and metal-poor ([Fe/H]$\leq-0.8$) cluster populations.},

  abstract      = {Dwarf galaxies populating the Galactic halo are assumed to host the largest fractions of dark matter, as calculated from their velocity dispersions. Their major axes are preferentially aligned with the Vast Polar Structure (VPOS) that is perpendicular to the Galactic disk, and we find their velocity gradients aligned as well. It suggests that tidal forces exerted by the Milky Way are distorting dwarf galaxies. Here we demonstrate on the basis of the impulse approximation that the Galactic gravitational acceleration induces the dwarf line-of-sight velocity dispersion, which is also evidenced by strong dependences between both quantities. Since this result is valid for any dwarf mass value, it implies that dark matter estimate in Milky Way dwarfs cannot be deduced from the product of their radius to the square of their line-of-sight velocity dispersion. This questions the high dark-matter fractions reported for these evanescent systems, and the universally adopted total-to-stellar mass relationship in the dwarf regime. It suggests that many dwarfs are at their first passage and are dissolving into the Galactic halo. It opens a promising way to estimate the Milky Way total mass profile at large distances.},

  abstract    = {We investigate the nature of the double color-magnitude sequence observed in the Gaia~DR2 HR diagram of stars with high transverse velocities. The stars in the reddest-color sequence are likely dominated by the dynamically-hot tail of the thick disk population. Information from Nissen & Schuster (2010) for some of the stars along the color-magnitude sequence suggests that stars in the blue-color sequence have elemental abundance patterns that can be explained by this population having a relatively low star-formation efficiency during its formation. A low star formation efficiency provides an evolutionary connection between stars with high-alpha abundances and low metallicities, [Fe/H]$<$-1.1 dex, and stars with low-alpha abundances and higher metallicities. In dynamical and orbital spaces, such as the "Toomre diagram", the two sequences show a significant overlap, but with a tendency for stars on the blue-color sequence to dominate regions with no or retrograde rotation and high total orbital energy. In the plane defined by the maximal vertical excursion of the orbits, $z_{\rm max}$, versus their apocenters, $R_{\rm 2Dmax}$, stars of both sequences redistribute into discrete wedges and we observe a dearth of stars with intermediate values of $z_{\rm max}$. We conclude that stars which are typically assigned to the halo in the solar vicinity, i.e., those having either slightly prograde or retrograde orbits, are actually both accreted stars lying along the blue sequence in the HR diagram, and the low velocity tail of the old Galactic disk, possibly dynamically heated by past accretion events. Our results imply that a halo population that formed \textit{in situ} and was responsible for the early chemical enrichment prior to the formation of the thick disk is yet to be robustly identified.},

  abstract      = {We use simulations to build an analytic probability distribution for the asphericity in the satellite distribution around Local Group (LG) type galaxies in the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) paradigm. We use this distribution to estimate the atypicality of the satellite distributions in the LG even when the underlying simulations do not have enough systems fully resembling the LG in terms of its typical masses, separation and kinematics. We demonstrate the method using three different simulations (Illustris-1, Illustris-1-Dark and ELVIS) and a number of satellites ranging from 11 to 15. Detailed results differ greatly among the simulations suggesting a strong influence of the typical DM halo mass, the number of satellites and the simulated baryonic effects. However, there are three common trends. First, at most $2\\%$ of the pairs are expected to have satellite distributions with the same asphericity as the LG; second, at most $80\\%$ of the pairs have a halo with a satellite distribution as aspherical as in M31; and third, at most $4\\%$ of the pairs have a halo with satellite distribution as planar as in the MW. These quantitative results place the LG at the level of a $3\sigma$ outlier in the LCDM paradigm. We suggest that understanding the reasons for this atypicality requires quantifying the asphericity probability distribution as a function of halo mass and large scale environment. The approach presented here can facilitate that kind of study and other comparisons between different numerical setups and choices to study satellites around LG pairs in simulations.},

  abstract      = {We apply an analytic theory for environmentally-dependent molecular cloud lifetimes to the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way. Within this theory, the cloud lifetime in the Galactic centre is obtained by combining the time-scales for gravitational instability, galactic shear, epicyclic perturbations and cloud-cloud collisions. We find that at galactocentric radii $\sim 45$-$120$ pc, corresponding to the location of the '100-pc stream', cloud evolution is primarily dominated by gravitational collapse, with median cloud lifetimes between 1.4 and 3.9 Myr. At all other galactocentric radii, galactic shear dominates the cloud lifecycle, and we predict that molecular clouds are dispersed on time-scales between 3 and 9 Myr, without a significant degree of star formation. Along the outer edge of the 100-pc stream, between radii of 100 and 120 pc, the time-scales for epicyclic perturbations and gravitational free-fall are similar. This similarity of time-scales lends support to the hypothesis that, depending on the orbital geometry and timing of the orbital phase, cloud collapse and star formation in the 100-pc stream may be triggered by a tidal compression at pericentre. Based on the derived time-scales, this should happen in approximately 20 per cent of all accretion events onto the 100-pc stream.},

  abstract    = {Self-interacting dark matter provides a promising alternative for the cold dark matter paradigm to solve potential small-scale galaxy formation problems. Nearly all self-interacting dark matter simulations so far have considered only elastic collisions. Here we present simulations of a galactic halo within a generic inelastic model using a novel numerical implementation in the Arepo code to study arbitrary multi-state inelastic dark matter scenarios. For this model we find that inelastic self-interactions can: (i) create larger subhalo density cores compared to elastic models for the same cross section normalisation; (ii) lower the abundance of satellites without the need for a power spectrum cutoff; (iii) reduce the total halo mass by about 10%; (iv) inject the energy equivalent of O(100) million Type II supernovae in galactic haloes through level de-excitation; (v) avoid the gravothermal catastrophe due to removal of particles from halo centers. We conclude that a ~5 times larger elastic cross section is required to achieve the same central density reduction as the inelastic model. This implies that well-established constraints on self-interacting cross sections have to be revised if inelastic collisions are the dominant mode. In this case significantly smaller cross sections can achieve the same core density reduction thereby increasing the parameter space of allowed models considerably.},

Their most massive stars are detected by Gaia, and we use Data Release 2 (DR2) to determine the galaxy proper motions (PMs). We select galaxy members based on, e.g., parallax, PM, color-magnitude-diagram location, and local stellar density. The PM rotation of both galaxies is confidently detected, consistent with the known line-of-sight rotation curves: $V_{\rm rot} = -206\pm86$ km s$^{-1}$ (counter-clockwise) for M31, and $V_{\rm rot} = 80\pm52$ km s$^{-1}$ (clockwise) for M33. We measure the center-of-mass PM of each galaxy relative to surrounding background quasars in DR2. This yields that $({\mu}_{\alpha*},{\mu}_{\delta})$ equals $(65 \pm 18 , -57 \pm 15)$ {\mu}as yr$^{-1}$ for M31, and $(31 \pm 19 , -29 \pm 16)$ {\mu}as yr$^{-1}$ for M33. In addition to the listed random errors, each component has an additional residual systematic error of 16 {\mu}as yr$^{-1}$. These results are consistent at 0.8{\sigma} and 1.0{\sigma} with the (2 and 3 times higher-accuracy) measurements already available from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical imaging and VLBA water maser observations, respectively. This lends confidence that all these measurements are robust. The new results imply that the M31 orbit towards the Milky Way is somewhat less radial than previously inferred, $V_{\rm tan, DR2+HST} = 57^{+35}_{-31}$ km s$^{-1}$, and strengthen arguments that M33 may be on its first infall into M31. The results highlight the future potential of Gaia for PM studies beyond the Milky Way satellite system.},

We provide here with solid evidence that such an unprecedented number of clusters could be largely overestimated. On the one hand, the fully-automatic procedure used to identify such an enormous cluster candidate sample did not recover ~ 50 per cent, in average, of the known relatively bright clusters located in the SMC main body. On the other hand, the number of new cluster candidates per time unit as a function of time results noticeably different to the intrinsic SMC cluster frequency (CF), which should not be the case if these new detections were genuine physical systems. We additionally found that the SMC CF varies spatially, in such a way that it resembles an outside-in process coupled with the effects of a relatively recent interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud. By assuming that clusters and field stars share the same formation history, we showed for the first time that the cluster dissolution rate also depends on the position in the galaxy. The cluster dissolution results higher as the concentration of galaxy mass increases or external tidal forces are present.},

  abstract    = {The quality and quantity of 6D stellar position-velocity measurements in the second Gaia data release (DR2) allows to study small-scale structure in the orbit distribution of the Galactic disc beyond the immediate Solar neighborhood. We investigate the distribution of orbital actions $(J_R,J_\phi=L_z,J_z)$ of $\sim 3.5$ million stars within $1.5~\text{kpc}$ of the Sun, for which precise actions can be calculated from Gaia DR2 alone. This distribution $n(J_R,L_z)$ reveals a remarkable amount of sub-structure. The known moving groups in the $(U,V)$-plane of the Solar neighborhood correspond to overdensities in $(J_R,L_z)$, as expected. But $n(J_R,L_z)$ also exhibits a wealth of density clumps and ridges that extend towards higher $J_R$. These $n(J_R,L_z)$ features are most prominent among orbits that stay close to the Galactic plane and remain consistently visible out to $\sim1.5~\text{kpc}$, as opposed to the sub-structure in velocity space. Some of these $n(J_R,L_z)$ ridges resemble features expected from rapid orbit diffusion along particular ($J_R,L_z$)-directions in the presence of various resonances. Several of these $n(J_R,L_z)$ structures show a dramatic imbalance of stars moving in or out, suggesting that stars are not phase-mixed along orbits or on resonant orbits. Orbital action and angle space of stars in Gaia DR2 is therefore highly structured over kpc-scales, and appears to be very informative for modeling studies of non-axisymmetric structure and resonances in the Galactic disc.},

  abstract    = {The anisotropy parameter $\beta$ characterizes the extent to which orbits in stellar systems are predominantly radial or tangential, and is likely to constrain, for the stellar halo of the Milky Way, scenarios for its formation and evolution. We have measured the anisotropy $\beta$ as a function of Galactocentric radius from $5-100$ kpc for over 8600 metal poor ([Fe/H] $<-1.3$) halo K giants from the LAMOST catalog with line-of-sight velocities and distances, matched to proper motions from the second $Gaia$ data release. We construct full 6-D positions and velocities for the K giants to directly measure the 3 components of the velocity dispersion $(\sigma_r, \sigma_\theta, \sigma_\phi)$ (in spherical coordinates). We find that the orbits in the halo are radial over our full Galactocentric distance range reaching over 100 kpc. The anisotropy remains remarkably unchanged with Galactocentric radius from approximately 5 to 25 kpc, with an amplitude that depends on the metallicity of the stars, dropping from $\beta \approx 0.9$ for $-1.8 \leq$ [Fe/H] $< -1.3$ (for the bulk of the stars) to $\beta \approx 0.6$ for the lowest metallicities ([Fe/H] $< -1.8$). Considering our sample as a whole, $\beta\approx0.8$ and, beyond 25 kpc, the orbits gradually become less radial and anisotropy decreases to $\beta<0.3$ past 100 kpc. Within 8 kpc, $\beta<0.8$. The measurement of anisotropy is affected by substructure and streams, particularly beyond a Galactocentric distance of approximately 25 kpc, where the Sagittarius stream is prominent in the data. These results are complimentary to recent analysis of simulations by Loebman et al. and of SDSS/$Gaia$ DR1 data by Belokurov et al.},

  abstract    = {We perform simulations of isolated galaxies in order to investigate the likely origin of the spiral structure in M33. In our models, we find that gravitational instabilities in the stars and gas are able to reproduce the observed spiral pattern and velocity field of M33, as seen in HI, and no interaction is required. We also find that the optimum models have high levels of stellar feedback which create large holes similar to those observed in M33, whilst lower levels of feedback tend to produce a large amount of small scale structure, and undisturbed long filaments of high surface density gas, hardly detected in the M33 disc. The gas component appears to have a significant role in producing the structure, so if there is little feedback, both the gas and stars organise into clear spiral arms, likely due to a lower combined $Q$ (using gas and stars), and the ready ability of cold gas to undergo spiral shocks. By contrast models with higher feedback have weaker spiral structure, especially in the stellar component, compared to grand design galaxies. We did not see a large difference in the behaviour of $Q_{stars}$ with most of these models, however, because $Q_{stars}$ stayed relatively constant unless the disc was more strongly unstable. Our models suggest that although the stars produce some underlying spiral structure, this is relatively weak, and the gas physics has a considerable role in producing the large scale structure of the ISM in flocculent spirals.},

  abstract    = {Bars are common galactic structures in the local universe that play an important role in the secular evolution of galaxies, including the Milky Way. In particular, the velocity distribution of individual stars in our galaxy is useful to shed light on stellar dynamics, and provides information complementary to that inferred from the integrated light of external galaxies. However, since a wide variety of models reproduce the distribution of velocity and the velocity dispersion observed in the Milky Way, we look for signatures of the bar on higher-order moments of the line-of-sight velocity ($V_{los}$) distribution. We make use of two different numerical simulations --one that has developed a bar and one that remains nearly axisymmetric-- to compare them with observations in the latest APOGEE data release (SDSS DR14). This comparison reveals three interesting structures that support the notion that the Milky Way is a barred galaxy. A high skewness region found at positive longitudes constrains the orientation angle of the bar, and is incompatible with the orientation of the bar at $\ell=0^\circ$ proposed in previous studies. We also analyse the $V_{los}$ distributions in three regions, and introduce the Hellinger distance to quantify the differences among them. Our results show a strong non-Gaussian distribution both in the data and in the barred model, confirming the qualitative conclusions drawn from the velocity maps. In contrast to earlier work, we conclude it is possible to infer the presence of the bar from the kurtosis distribution.},

  abstract    = {Context. Most of our knowledge on the stellar component of galaxies is based on the analysis of distant systems and comes from integrated light data. It is important to test whether the results of the star formation histories (SFH) obtained with standard full-spectrum fitting methods are in agreement with those obtained through colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) fitting (usually considered the most reliable approach). Aims. We compare SFHs recovered from both techniques in Leo~A, a Local Group dwarf galaxy whose majority of stars formed during the last 8 Gyrs. This complements our previous findings in a field in the Large Magellanic Cloud bar, where star formation has been on-going since early epochs though at varying rates. Methods. We have used GTC/OSIRIS in long-slit mode to obtain a high-quality integrated light spectrum by scanning a selected region within Leo~A, for which a CMD reaching the old main mequence turn-off (oMSTO) is available from HST. We compared the SFH obtained from the two datasets, using state-of-art methods of integrated light ({\tt STECKMAP}) and resolved stellar population analysis. In the case of the CMD, we computed the SFH both from a deep CMD (observed with HST/ACS), and from a shallower one (archival data from HST/WFPC2). Results. The agreement between the SFHs recovered from the oMSTO CMD and from full spectrum fitting is remarkable, particularly regarding the time evolution of the star formation rate. The overall extremely low metallicity of Leo~A is recovered up to the last 2 Gyrs, when some discrepancies appear. A relatively high metallicity found for the youngest stars from the integrated data is a recurring feature that might indicate that the current models or synthesis codes should be revised, but that can be significantly mitigated using a more restrictive metallicity range...

  title       = {The VMC survey - XXXI. The spatially resolved star formation history of the main body of the Small Magellanic Cloud},
  abstract    = {We recover the spatially resolved star formation history across the entire main body and Wing of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), using fourteen deep tile images from the VISTA survey of the Magellanic Clouds (VMC), in the YJKs filters. The analysis is performed on 168 subregions of size 0.143 deg2, covering a total contiguous area of 23.57 deg2. We apply a colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) reconstruction method that returns the best-fitting star formation rate SFR(t), age--metallicity relation, distance and mean reddening, together with their confidence intervals, for each subregion. With respect to previous analyses, we use a far larger set of VMC data, updated stellar models, and fit the two available CMDs (Y-Ks versus Ks and J-Ks versus Ks) independently. The results allow us to derive a more complete and more reliable picture of how the mean distances, extinction values, star formation rate, and metallicities vary across the SMC, and provide a better description of the populations that form its Bar and Wing. We conclude that the SMC has formed a total mass of (5.31+-0.05)x10^8 Msun in stars over its lifetime. About two thirds of this mass is expected to be still locked in stars and stellar remnants. 50 per cent of the mass was formed prior to an age of 6.3 Gyr, and 80 per cent was formed between 8 and 3.5 Gyr ago. We also illustrate the likely distribution of stellar ages and metallicities in different parts of the CMD, to aid the interpretation of data from future astrometric and spectroscopic surveys of the SMC.},

  title       = {The disk averaged star formation relation for Local Volume dwarf galaxies},
  abstract    = {Spatially resolved HI studies of dwarf galaxies have provided a wealth of precision data. However these high-quality, resolved observations are only possible for handful of dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume. Future HI surveys are unlikely to improve the current situation. We therefore explore a method for estimating the surface density of the atomic gas from global HI parameters, which are conversely widely available. We perform empirical tests using galaxies with resolved HI maps, and find that our approximation produces values for the surface density of atomic hydrogen within typically 0.5dex of the true value. We apply this method to a sample of 147 galaxies drawn from modern near-infrared stellar photometric surveys. With this sample we confirm a strict correlation between the atomic gas surface density and the star formation rate surface density, that is vertically offset from the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation by a factor of 10-30, and significantly steeper than the classical N=1.4 of Kennicutt (1998). We further infer the molecular fraction in the sample of low surface brightness, predominantly dwarf galaxies by assuming that the star formation relationship with molecular gas observed for spiral galaxies also holds in these galaxies, finding a molecular-to-atomic gas mass fraction within the range of 5-15%. Comparison of the data to available models shows that a model in which the thermal pressure balances the vertical gravitational field captures better the shape of the $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}-\Sigma_{\rm gas}$ relationship. However, such models fail to reproduce the data completely, suggesting that thermal pressure plays an important role in the disks of dwarf galaxies.},

  abstract    = {Carbon enhanced metal poor (CEMP) stars with low abundances of neutron capture elements (CEMP-no stars) are ubiquitous among metal poor population in the Milky Way. Recent observations have uncovered their two subgroups that differ in the carbon to magnesium ([C/Mg]) abundance ratio. Here we demonstrate that similar abundance patterns are also present in Milky Way-like galaxies in the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, where these patterns originate from the fact that stars may form from gas enriched predominantly by asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars or by type-II supernovae. This occurs when stars form in the poorly mixed interstellar medium of Milky Way progenitor galaxies that are undergoing bursty star formation. The CEMP-no stars with lower [C/Mg] form at the onset of a starburst from gas enriched by low metallicity type-II supernovae that power a strong outflow, quenching further star formation. When star formation resumes following cosmological gas accretion, the CEMP-no stars with higher [C/Mg] form, with enrichment by AGB ejecta evident in their higher abundance of barium and lower abundance of magnesium. This suggests that bursty star formation in the progenitors of the Galaxy leaves a permanent imprint in the abundance patterns of CEMP stars.},

Here, we revisit the issue of the kinematics of this interesting star using Gaia DR2. The heliocentric Galactic velocity components are (U, V, W) = (206, -289, 30) km/s; the corresponding Galactocentric Galactic velocity components show that LP 543-25 is moving in the Galactic plane and away from the Galactic Center at a rate of nearly 200 km/s, which is compatible with an origin in one of the multiple star clusters that inhabit the inner regions of the Milky Way. LP 543-25 appears to be a member of an elusive class of stars, the low-mass runaway stars. It is perhaps one of the closest and less massive runaway stars identified so far.},

  abstract    = {Gamma ray observations have found evidence of an extremely energetic outflow emanating from the Galactic Centre, and an `excess' of emission at GeV energies towards the Galactic Centre over that expected from current models. Determining whether the outflow is AGN- or star formation-driven, and whether the `excess' is astrophysical in origin or requires new physics (e.g. self-annihilation of dark matter), requires the accurate modelling of the expected energy injection from astrophysical sources and the subsequent interaction with the surrounding environment. We briefly summarise current constraints on the distribution of gas and young stars in the inner few hundred parsec of the Galaxy that can be included in future 2D and 3D modelling of the astrophysical gamma ray emission. The key points to highlight with respect to predominantly axisymmetric models currently in use are: (i) the distribution of dense gas, young stars and interstellar radiation field is highly asymmetric around the Galactic Centre; (ii) star formation is almost exclusively constrained to a Galactocentric radius of ~100pc; (iii) the star formation rate in this region has been constant at <0.1Msun/yr to within a factor of 2 over the last ~5 Myr.},

  abstract      = {We use a new mass modelling method, GravSphere, to measure the central dark matter density profile of the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Draco's star formation shut down long ago, making it a prime candidate for hosting a 'pristine' dark matter cusp, unaffected by stellar feedback during galaxy formation. We first test GravSphere on a suite of three tidally stripped mock 'Draco'-like dwarfs, placed on orbits similar to the real Draco around the Milky Way, containing realistic populations of binary stars, and with realistic foreground contamination. We show that we are able to correctly infer the dark matter density profile of both cusped and cored mocks within our 95\% confidence intervals. While we obtain only a weak inference on the logarithmic slope of these density profiles, we are able to obtain a robust inference of the amplitude of the inner dark matter density at 150pc, $\rho\_{\rm DM}(150\,{\rm pc})$. We show that, combined with constraints on the density profile at larger radii, this is sufficient to distinguish a $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cusp $-$ that has $\rho\_{\rm DM}(150\,{\rm pc}) \gt 1.8 \times 10^8\,{\rm M}\_\odot \,{\rm kpc}^{-3}$ $-$ from alternative dark matter models that have lower inner densities. We then apply GravSphere to the real Draco data. We find that Draco has an inner dark matter density of $\rho\_{\rm DM}(150\,{\rm pc}) = 2.4\_{-0.6}^{+0.5} \times 10^8\,{\rm M}\_\odot \,{\rm kpc}^{-3}$, consistent with a $\Lambda$CDM cusp. Using a velocity independent SIDM model, calibrated on $\Lambda$SIDM cosmological simulations, we show that Draco's high central density gives an upper bound on the SIDM cross section of $\sigma/m \lt 0.57\,{\rm cm}^2\,{\rm g}^{-1}$ at 99\% confidence. We conclude that the inner density of nearby dwarf galaxies like Draco provides a new and competitive probe of dark matter models.},

In order to enhance image quality and then obtain deeper photometry, we construct Nyquist-sampled images and use a deconvolution method to detect sources and measure their photometry. We demonstrate that our method performs better than DOLPHOT in the extremely crowded region. The resolved stars in the M31 bulge have been divided into nine annuli and the color magnitude diagram fitting is performed for each of them. We confirm that the majority of stars ($\gt$ 70\%) in the M31 bulge are indeed very old ($\gt$5 Gyr) and metal-rich ([Fe/H] $\gt$ 0.3). At later times, the star formation rate decreased and then experienced a significant rise around 1 Gyr ago, which pervaded the entire M31 bulge. After that, stars formed at less than 500 Myr ago in the central 130``. Through simulation, we find that these intermediate-age stars cannot be the artifacts introduced by the blending effect. Our results suggest that although the majority of the M31 bulge are very old, the secular evolutionary process still continuously builds up the M31 bulge slowly. We compare our star formation history with an older analysis derived from the spectral energy distribution fitting, which suggests that the latter one is still a reasonable tool for the study of stellar populations in remote galaxies.},

The second Gaia data release contains precise astrometry at the sub-milliarcsecond level and homogeneous photometry at the mmag level, that can be used to characterise a large number of clusters over the entire sky. In this study we aim to a establish list of members and derive mean parameters, in particular distances, for as many clusters as possible, making use of Gaia data alone. We compile a list of thousands of known or putative clusters from the literature. We then apply an unsupervised membership assignment code, UPMASK, to the Gaia DR2 data contained within the fields of those clusters. We obtained a list of members and cluster parameters for 1212 clusters. As expected, the youngest clusters are seen to be tightly distributed near the Galactic plane and to trace the spiral arms of the Milky Way, while older objects are more uniformly distributed, deviate further from the plane, and tend to be located at larger Galactocentric distances. Thanks to the quality of GaiaDR2 astrometry, the fully homogeneous parameters derived in this study are the most precise to date. Furthermore, we report on the serendipitous discovery of 54 new open clusters in the fields analysed during this study.},

  title       = {Measuring Radial Orbit Migration in the Milky Way Disk},
  abstract    = {We develop and apply a model to quantify the global efficiency of radial orbit migration among stars in the Milky Way disk. This model parameterizes the possible star formation and enrichment histories, radial birth profiles, and combines them with a migration model that relates present-day orbital radii to birth radii through a Gaussian probability, broadening with age $\tau$ as $\sigma_\mathrm{RM8}~\sqrt{\tau/8{~\mathrm{Gyr}}}$. Guided by observations, we assume that stars are born with an initially tight age--metallicity relation at given radius, which becomes subsequently scrambled by radial orbit migration, thereby providing a direct observational constraint on radial orbit migration strength $\sigma_\mathrm{RM8}$. We fit this model with MCMC to the observed age--metallicity distribution of low-$\alpha$ red clump stars with Galactocentric radii between 5 and 14 kpc from APOGEE DR12, sidestepping the complex spatial selection function and accounting for the considerable age uncertainties. This simple model reproduces well the observed data, and we find a global (in radius and time) radial orbit migration efficiency in the Milky Way of $\sigma_\mathrm{RM8}=3.6\pm 0.1$ kpc when marginalizing over all other model aspects. This shows that radial orbit migration in the Milky Way's main disk is indeed rather strong, in line with theoretical expectations: stars migrate by about a half-mass radius over the age of the disk. The model finds the Sun's birth radius at $\sim 5.2$ kpc. If such strong radial orbit migration is typical, this mechanism plays indeed an important role in setting the structural regularity of disk galaxies.},

  title       = {Distinguishing Standard from Modified Gravity in the Local Group and beyond},
  abstract    = {The works in this portfolio test the hypothesis that it is not possible to extrapolate the Newtonian inverse square law of gravity from Solar System to galaxy scales. In particular, I look into various tests of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), which posits a modification below a very low acceleration threshold. Although discrepancies with Newtonian dynamics are indeed observed, they can usually be explained by invoking an appropriate distribution of invisible mass known as dark matter (DM). This leads to the standard cosmological paradigm, $\Lambda$CDM. I consider how it may be distinguished from MOND using collision velocities of galaxy clusters, which should sometimes be much faster in MOND. I focus on measuring these velocities more accurately and conclude that this test ought to be feasible in the near future. For the time being, I look at the much nearer and more accurately observed Local Group (LG) of galaxies. Its main constituents $-$ the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) $-$ should have undergone a past close flyby in MOND but not in $\Lambda$CDM. The fast MW-M31 relative motion around the time of their flyby would have allowed them to gravitationally slingshot any passing LG dwarf galaxies out at high speed. I consider whether there is any evidence for such high-velocity galaxies (HVGs). Several candidates are found in two different $\Lambda$CDM models of the LG, one written by a founding figure of the paradigm. The properties of these HVGs are similar to what might be expected in MOND, especially their tendency to lie close to a plane. Being more confident of its validity, I then used MOND to determine the escape velocity curve of the MW over the distance range 8$-$50 kpc, finding reasonable agreement with the latest observations. I finish by discussing possible future directions for MOND research.},

The Riegel-Crutcher (R-C) cloud is the most striking HISA feature in the Galaxy. It is one of the closest HISA clouds to us and is located in the direction of the Galactic Centre, which provides a bright background. High-resolution interferometric measurements have revealed the filamentary structure of this cloud, however it is difficult to accurately determine the temperature and the density of the gas without optical depth measurements. In this paper we present new HI absorption observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) against 46 continuum sources behind the Riegel-Crutcher cloud to directly measure the optical depth of the cloud. We decompose the complex HI absorption spectra into Gaussian components using an automated machine learning algorithm. We find 300 Gaussian components, from which 67 are associated with the R-C cloud (0 $\lt$ v\_$\{$LSR$\}$ $\lt$ 10 kms, FWHM $\lt$ 10 kms). Combining the new HI absorption data with HI emission data from previous surveys we calculate the spin temperature and find it to be between 20 and 80 K. Our measurements uncover a temperature gradient across the cloud with spin temperatures decreasing towards positive Galactic latitudes. We also find three new OH absorption lines associated with the cloud, which support the presence of molecular gas.},

These observations allowed us to produce the most complete H ii region catalog for it to date, with a total of 976 sources. This doubles the number of H ii regions previously found for this object. We used these data to construct the H ii luminosity function, and obtained a power-law index lower than the typical values found for Sc galaxies. This shallower slope is related to the presence of a significant number of high-luminosity H ii regions (logL$\gt$39 dex). We also constructed the size distribution function, verifying that, as for most galaxies, NGC 1232 follows an exponential law. We also used the H$\{$$\backslash$alpha$\}$ luminosity to calculate the star formation rate. An extremely interesting fact about this galaxy is that X-ray diffuse observations suggest that NGC 1232 recently suffered a collision with a dwarf galaxy. We found an absence of star formation around the region where the X-ray emission is more intense, which we interpret as a star formation quenching due to the collision. Along with that, we found an excess of star-forming regions in the northeast part of the galaxy, where the X-ray emission is less intense.},

Previous work has shown that the stellar halo density falls off much more rapidly beyond this break radius. We argue that the correspondence between the apocenters of high metallicity, high eccentricity stars and the broken density profile is caused by the build-up of stars at the apocenter of a common dwarf progenitor. Although the radially biased stars are likely present down to metallicities of [Fe/H] ~ -2 the increasing dominance at higher metallicities suggests a massive dwarf progenitor, which is at least as massive as the Fornax and Sagittarius dwarf galaxies, and is likely the dominant progenitor of the inner stellar halo.},

We select and present further stars that may be Bo\"{o}tes III members based on their combined proper motion and position in the color magnitude diagram, but we caution against assigning membership to stars that are not confirmed spectroscopically, as we demonstrate that there are contaminating stars from the disrupting globular cluster NGC 5466 in the vicinity of the main body of Bo\"{o}tes III. Based on the measured proper motion and other known properties of Bo\"{o}tes III, we derive its Galactocentric velocity and compute its orbit given canonical Milky Way potentials with halo masses of both 0.8$\times$10$^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$ and 1.6$\times$10$^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$. These orbits robustly show that Bo\"{o}tes III passed within $ \sim$12 kpc of the Galactic center on an eccentric orbit roughly 140 Myr ago. Additionally, the proper motion of Bo\"{o}tes III is in excellent agreement with predictions for the retrograde motion of the coincident Styx stellar stream. Given this, along with the small pericenter and metallicity spread of Bo\"{o}tes III itself, we suggest that it is a disrupting dwarf galaxy giving rise to the Styx stellar stream.},

  abstract      = {We present spatially resolved measurements of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in NGC 1399, the largest elliptical galaxy in the Fornax Cluster. Using data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) and updated state-of-the-art stellar population synthesis models from Conroy et. al 2018, we use full spectral fitting to measure the low-mass IMF, as well as a number of individual elemental abundances, as a function of radius in this object. We find that the IMF in NGC 1399 is heavier than the Milky Way in its centre and remains radially constant at a super-salpeter slope out to 0.7 R$\_{e}$. At radii larger than this, the IMF slope decreases to become marginally consistent with a Milky Way IMF just beyond R$\_{e}$. The inferred central V-band M/L ratio is in excellent agreement with the previously reported dynamical M/L measurement from Houghton et. al 2006. The measured radial form of the M/L ratio may be evidence for a two-phase formation in this object, with the central regions forming differently to the outskirts. We also report measurements of a spatially resolved filament of ionised gas extending 4 arcseconds (404 pc at $D\_{\mathrm{L}}=21.1$ Mpc) from the centre of NGC 1399, with very narrow equivalent width and low velocity dispersion ($65\pm14$ $\backslash$kms). The location of the emission, combined with an analysis of the emission line ratios, leads us to conclude that NGC 1399's AGN is the source of ionising radiation.},

  abstract      = {We use $N$-body simulations to investigate the excitation of bending waves in a Milky Way-like disc-bulge-halo system. The dark matter halo consists of a smooth component and a population of subhaloes while the disc is composed of thin and thick components. Also considered is a control simulation where all of the halo mass is smoothly distributed. We find that bending waves are more vigorously excited in the thin disc than the thick one and that the they are strongest in the outer regions of the disc, especially at late times. By way of a Fourier decomposition, we find that the complicated pattern of bending across the disc can be described as a superposition of modes. The modes concentrate along two branches in the radius-rotational frequency plane, which correspond to vertical resonance curves as predicted by a WKB analysis. Bending waves in the simulation with substructure have a higher amplitude than those in the smooth-halo simulation, though the frequency-radius characteristics of the waves in the two simulations are very similar. A cross correlation analysis of vertical displacement and bulk vertical velocity suggests that the modes oscillate largely as simple plane waves. We suggest that the wave-like features in astrometric surveys such as the Second Data Release from $\backslash$textit$\{$Gaia$\}$ may be due to long-lived modes of a dynamically active disc rather than, or in addition to, perturbations from a recent satellite-disc encounter.},

We show that the evolution of the model exhibits behaviours typical of kinematic fractionation, with a bar weaker in older populations, an X-shape traced by the younger, metal-rich populations and a prominent X-shape in the edge-on mean metallicity map. Because of the late formation of the bar in m12m, stars forming after 10 Gyr (z=0.34) significantly contaminate the bulge, at a level higher than is observed at high latitudes in the Milky Way, implying that its bar cannot have formed as late as in m12m. We also study the model's vertex deviation of the velocity ellipsoid as a function of stellar metallicity and age in the equivalent of Baade's Window. The formation of the bar leads to a non-zero vertex deviation. We find that metal-rich stars have a large vertex deviation, which becomes negligible for metal-poor stars, a trend also found in the Milky Way. We demonstrate that the vertex deviation also varies with stellar age and is large for stars as old as 9 Gyr, while 13 Gyr old stars have negligible vertex deviation. When we exclude stars that have been accreted, the vertex deviation is not significantly changed, demonstrating that the observed variation of vertex deviation with metallicity is not necessarily due to an accreted population.},

The central sub-mm emission cavity is revealed to be eccentric; once deprojected, its outer edge can be well-fitted by an ellipse with an eccentricity of 0.1 and one focus on the star. The broad ring-like outer disk is resolved into three narrow rings with two gaps in between. The outer two rings tentatively show the same eccentricity and orientation as the innermost ring bounding the inner cavity. The two previously known dust emission clumps are resolved in both the radial and azimuthal directions, with radial widths equal to $\sim$4$\times$ the local scale height. Only one of the two spiral arms previously imaged in near-infrared (NIR) scattered light is revealed in ALMA dust emission, at a slightly larger stellocentric distance owing to projection effects. We also submit evidence of disk truncation at $\sim$100 AU based on comparing NIR imaging observations with models. The spirals, the north clump, and the truncated disk edge are all broadly consistent with the presence of one companion exterior to the spirals at roughly 100 AU.},

The discovery of this extended and extremely low surface brightness stream ($\Sigma\_G\sim 34.6 \, {\rm mag \, arcsec^{-2}}$) with a mass of only $1180\pm90 \, {\rm\,M\_\odot}$, demonstrates the power of the STREAMFINDER algorithm to detect even very nearby and ultra-faint structures.

From a radiative transfer analysis, we self-consistently compute 3D cubes of optical depth, excitation temperature, and column density for $\sim$300 massive clumps, and update the $I\_{\rm CO}$-dependent CO$\rightarrow$H$\_2$ conversion law of Barnes et al (2015). For $N$ $\propto$ $I^p$, we find $p$ = 1.92$\pm$0.05 for the velocity-resolved conversion law aggregated over all clumps. A practical, integrated conversion law is $N\_{\rm CO}$ = (4.0$\pm$0.3)$\times$10$^{19}$m$^{-2}$ $I\_{\rm CO}^{1.27\pm0.02}$, confirming an overall 2$\times$ higher total molecular mass for Milky Way clouds, compared to the standard $X$ factor. We use these laws to compare the kinematics of clump interiors with their foreground $^{12}$CO envelopes, and find evidence that most clumps are not dynamically uniform: irregular portions seem to be either slowly accreting onto the interiors, or dispersing from them. We compute the spatially-resolved mass accretion/dispersal rate across all clumps, and map the local flow timescale. While these flows are not clearly correlated with clump structures, the inferred accretion rate is a statistically strong function of the local mass surface density $\Sigma$, suggesting near-exponential growth or loss of mass over effective timescales $\sim$30-50 Myr. At high enough $\Sigma$, accretion dominates, suggesting gravity plays an important role in both processes. If confirmed by numerical simulations, this sedimentation picture would support arguments for long clump lifetimes mediated by pressure confinement, with a terminal crescendo of star formation, suggesting a resolution to the 40-yr-old puzzle of the dynamical state of molecular clouds and their low star formation efficiency.},

We searched each catalog for data on the 444 targets of our earlier survey and for the 135 in the survey reported here. We confirm that, as anticipated, most of our targets have colors typical of oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Only one target star may have already left the AGB.

  abstract    = {We present a new, probabilistic method for determining the systemic proper motions of Milky Way (MW) ultra-faint satellites in the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We utilize the superb photometry from the first public data release (DR1) of DES to select candidate members, and cross-match them with the proper motions from $Gaia$ DR2. We model the candidate members with a mixture model (satellite and MW) in spatial and proper motion space. This method does not require prior knowledge of satellite membership, and can successfully determine the tangential motion of most of the DES satellites. With our method we present measurements of the following satellites that lack spectroscopic follow-up: Columba~I, Eridanus~III, Grus~II, Phoenix~II, Pictor~I, Reticulum~III, and Tucana~IV, the majority of which are the first systemic proper motion measurements. We compare these to the predictions of Large Magellanic Cloud satellites and to the vast polar structure. With the high precision DES photometry we conclude that most of the newly identified member stars are very metal-poor ([Fe/H] $\lesssim -2$) similar to other ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, while Reticulum III is likely more metal-rich. We also find potential members in the following satellites that might indicate their overall proper motion: Cetus~II, Kim~2/Indus~I, Horologium~II, and Tucana~V; however, due to the small number of members in each satellite, spectroscopic follow-up observations are necessary to determine the systemic proper motion in these satellites.},

We report new observational constraints on the gaseous halo using 107 lines-of-sight of the Suzaku X-ray observations at $75^{\circ}\ltl\lt285^{\circ}$ and $|b|\gt15^{\circ}$ with a total exposure of 6.4 Ms. The gaseous halo spectra are represented by a single-temperature plasma model in collisional ionization equilibrium. The median temperature of the observed fields is 0.26 keV ($3.0\times10^6$ K) with a typical fluctuation of $\sim30$\%. The emission measure varies by an order of magnitude and marginally correlates with the Galactic latitude. Despite the large scatter of the data, the emission measure distribution is roughly reproduced by a disk-like density distribution with a scale length of $\sim7$ kpc, a scale height of $\sim2$ kpc, and a total mass of $\sim5\times10^7$ $M\_{\odot}$. In addition, we found that a spherical hot gas with the $\beta$-model profile hardly contributes to the observed X-rays but that its total mass might reach $\gtrsim10^9$ $M\_{\odot}$. Combined with indirect evidence of an extended gaseous halo from other observations, the hot gaseous halo likely consists of a dense disk-like component and a rarefied spherical component; the X-ray emissions primarily come from the former but the mass is dominated by the latter. The disk-like component likely originates from stellar feedback in the Galactic disk due to the low scale height and the large scatter of the emission measures. The median [O/Fe] of $\sim0.25$ shows the contribution of the core-collapse supernovae and supports the stellar feedback origin.},

  abstract      = {Deep, pencil-beam surveys from ALMA at 1.1-1.3mm have uncovered an apparent absence of high-redshift dusty galaxies, with existing redshift distributions peaking around $z\sim1.5-2.5$. This has led to a perceived dearth of dusty systems at $z\gt4$, and the conclusion, according to some models, that the early Universe was relatively dust-poor. In this paper, we extend the backward evolution galaxy model described by Casey et al. (2018) to the ALMA regime (in depth and area) and determine that the measured number counts and redshift distributions from ALMA deep field surveys are fully consistent with constraints of the infrared luminosity function (IRLF) at $z\lt2.5$ determined by single-dish submillimeter and millimeter surveys conducted on much larger angular scales ($\sim1-10$deg$^{2}$). We find that measured 1.1-1.3mm number counts are most constraining for the measurement of the faint-end slope of the IRLF at $z\lt2.5$ instead of the prevalence of dusty galaxies at $z\gt4$. Recent studies have suggested that UV-selected galaxies at $z\gt4$ may be particularly dust-poor, but we find their millimeter-wave emission cannot rule out consistency with the Calzetti dust attenuation law even by assuming relatively typical, cold-dust ($T\_{\rm dust}\approx30\,$K) SEDs. Our models suggest that the design of ALMA deep fields requires substantial revision to constrain the prevalence of $z\gt4$ early Universe obscured starbursts. The most promising avenue for detection and characterization of such early dusty galaxies will come from future ALMA 2mm blank field surveys covering a few hundred arcmin$^{2}$ and the combination of existing and future dual-purpose 3mm datasets.},

The averaged radial velocity of the bright component ``C3'' with reference to the radio core is found to be $0.27 pm 0.02c$ between 2007 October and 2013 December. This constant velocity of C3 is naturally explained by the advancing motion of the head of the mini-radio lobe. We also find a non-linear component in the motion of C3 with respect to the radio core. We briefly discuss possible origins of this non-linear motion.},

  abstract      = {Context. PKS 1510-089 is a flat spectrum radio quasar strongly variable in the optical and GeV range. So far, very-high-energy (VHE) emission has been observed from this source during either long high states of optical and GeV activity or during short flares. Aims. We search for low-state VHE gamma-ray emission from PKS 1510-089. We aim to characterize and model the source in a broad-band context, which would provide a baseline over which high states and flares could be better understood. Methods. PKS 1510-089 has been monitored by the MAGIC telescopes since 2012. We use daily binned Fermi-LAT flux measurements of PKS 1510-089 to characterize the GeV emission and select the observation periods of MAGIC during low state of activity. For the selected times we compute the average radio, IR, optical, UV, X-ray and gamma-ray emission to construct a low-state spectral energy distribution of the source. The broadband emission is modelled within an External Compton scenario with a stationary emission region through which plasma and magnetic field are flowing. Results. The MAGIC telescopes collected 75 hrs of data during times when the Fermi-LAT flux measured above 1 GeV was below 3x10 -8 cm -2 s -1 , which is the threshold adopted for the definition of a low gamma-ray activity state. The data show a strongly significant (9.5$\{$$\backslash$sigma$\}$) VHE gamma-ray emission at the level of (4.27 +- 0.61 stat ) x 10 -12 cm -2 s -1 above 150 GeV, a factor 80 smaller than the highest flare observed so far from this object. Despite the lower flux, the spectral shape is consistent with earlier detections in the VHE band. The broad-band emission is compatible with the External Compton scenario assuming a large emission region located beyond the broad line region.},

The Gaia mission was conceived to unravel the assembly history of our own Galaxy, the Milky Way. Gaia's recently delivered second data release allows tackling this objective like never before. Here we analyse the kinematics, chemistry, age and spatial distribution of stars in a relatively large volume around the Sun that are mainly linked to two major Galactic components, the thick disk and the stellar halo. We demonstrate that the inner halo is dominated by debris from an object slightly more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud, and which we refer to as Gaia-Enceladus. The accretion of Gaia-Enceladus must have led to the dynamical heating of the precursor of the thick disk and hence contributed to the formation of this component approximately 10 Gyr ago.},

  abstract      = {We use the age-metallicity distribution of 96 Galactic globular clusters (GCs) to infer the formation and assembly history of the Milky Way (MW), culminating in the reconstruction of its merger tree. Based on a quantitative comparison of the Galactic GC population to the 25 cosmological zoom-in simulations of MW-mass galaxies in the E-MOSAICS project, which self-consistently model the formation and evolution of GC populations in a cosmological context, we find that the MW assembled quickly for its mass, reaching $\{25,50\}\\%$ of its present-day halo mass already at $z=\{3,1.5\}$ and half of its present-day stellar mass at $z=1.2$. We reconstruct the MW's merger tree from its GC age-metallicity distribution, inferring the number of mergers as a function of mass ratio and redshift. These statistics place the MW's assembly $\textit{rate}$ among the 72th-94th percentile of the E-MOSAICS galaxies, whereas its $\textit{integrated}$ properties (e.g. number of mergers, halo concentration) match the median of the simulations. We conclude that the MW has experienced no major mergers (mass ratios $\gt$1:4) since $z\sim4$, sharpening previous limits of $z\sim2$. We identify three massive satellite progenitors and constrain their mass growth and enrichment histories. Two are proposed to correspond to Sagittarius (few $10^8~{\rm M}\_\odot$) and Canis Major ($\sim10^9~{\rm M}\_\odot$). The third satellite has no known associated relic and was likely accreted between $z=0.6$-$1.3$. We name this enigmatic galaxy $\textit{Kraken}$ and propose that it is the most massive satellite ($M\_*\sim2\times10^9~{\rm M}\_\odot$) ever accreted by the MW. We predict that $\sim40\\%$ of the Galactic GCs formed ex-situ (in galaxies with masses $M\_*=2\times10^7$-$2\times10^9~{\rm M}\_\odot$), with $6\pm1$ being former nuclear clusters.},

  abstract      = {According to star formation histories (SFHs), Local Group dwarf galaxies can be broadly classified in two types: those forming most of their stars before $z=2$ (${\it fast}$) and those with more extended SFHs (${\it slow}$). The most precise SFHs are usually derived from deep but not very spatially extended photometric data; this might alter the ratio of old to young stars when age gradients are present. Here we correct for this effect and derive the mass formed in stars by $z=2$ for a sample of 16 Local Group dwarf galaxies. We explore early differences between ${\it fast}$ and ${\it slow}$ dwarfs, and evaluate the impact of internal feedback by supernovae (SN) on the baryonic and dark matter (DM) component of the dwarfs. ${\it Fast}$ dwarfs assembled more stellar mass at early times and have larger amounts of DM within the half-light radius than ${\it slow}$ dwarfs. By imposing that ${\it slow}$ dwarfs cannot have lost their gas by $z=2$, we constrain the maximum coupling efficiency of SN feedback to the gas and to the DM to be $\sim$10\%. We find that internal feedback alone appears insufficient to quench the SFH of ${\it fast}$ dwarfs by gas deprivation, in particular for the fainter systems. Nonetheless, SN feedback can core the DM halo density profiles relatively easily, producing cores of the sizes of the half-light radius in ${\it fast}$ dwarfs by $z=2$ with very low efficiencies. Amongst the ``classical'' Milky Way satellites, we predict that the smallest cores should be found in Draco and Ursa Minor, while Sculptor and Fornax should host the largest ones.},

We obtain its rotation curve as well as deprojected radial H$\{$$\backslash$sc i$\}$ surface density profile by fitting a 3-dimensional tilted ring model directly to the H$\{$$\backslash$sc i$\}$ data cubes by using the publicly-available software, Fully Automated Tirrific (FAT). We also present the rotation curve of FGC1540 derived from its optical spectroscopy study using the 6-m BTA telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences. We use the rotation curve, the H$\{$$\backslash$sc i$\}$ surface density profile together with Spitzer 3.6 $\mu$m and the SDSS $i$--band data to construct the mass models for FGC1540. We find that both the Pseudo-isothermal (PIS), as well as Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) dark matter (DM) halos, fit the observed rotation curve equally well. The PIS model indicates a compact dark matter halo ($R\_{\rm C}/R\_{\rm D}$ $\lt$ 2), with the best-fitting core radius ($R\_{\rm C}$) approximately half the exponential stellar disc scale length ($R\_{\rm D}$), which is in agreement with the mass models of superthin galaxies studied earlier in the literature. Since the vertical thickness of the galactic stellar disc is determined by a balance between the net gravitational field and the velocity dispersion in the vertical direction, the compact dark matter halo may be primarily responsible in regulating the superthin vertical structure of the stellar disc in FGC1540 as was found in case of the superthin galaxy UGC7321.},

Here, we present our first analysis of the stellar halo from detailed maps of Blue Horizontal Branch (BHB) stars drawn from the SkyMapper Southern Sky Survey. To isolate candidate BHB stars from the overall population, we develop a machine-learning approach through the application of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), resulting in a relatively pure sample of target stars. From this, we derive the absolute $u$ magnitude for the BHB sample to be $\sim2\ mag$, varying slightly with $(v-g)\_0$ and $(u-v)\_0$ colours. We examine the BHB number density distribution from 5272 candidate stars, deriving a double power-law with a break radius of $r\_s = 11.8\pm0.3\ kpc$, and inner and outer slopes of $\alpha\_{in} = -2.5\pm0.1$ and $\alpha\_{out} = -4.5\pm0.3$ respectively. Through isochrone fitting of simulated BHB stars, we find a colour-age/metallicity correlation, with older/more metal-poor stars being bluer, and establish a parameter to indicate this age (or metallicity) variation. Using this, we construct the three-dimensional population distribution of BHB stars in the halo and identify significant substructure. Finally, in agreement with previous studies, we also identify a systemic age/metallicity shift spanning $\sim3\ kpc$ to $ \sim20\ kpc$ in galactocentric distance.},

All lines are robustly detected at the central gaseous filamentary structure including the eastern nucleus and the Overlap region, the collision interface of the progenitors. We found that there is no correlation between star formation efficiency and dense gas fraction, indicating that the amount of dense gas does not simply control star formation in VV 114. We predict the presence of more turbulent and diffuse molecular gas clouds around the Overlap region compared to those at the nuclear region assuming a turbulence-regulated star formation model. The intracloud turbulence at the Overlap region might be excited by galaxy-merger-induced shocks, which also explains the enhancement of gas-phase CH$\_3$OH abundance previously found there. We also present spatially resolved spectral line energy distributions of HCN and HCO$^+$ for the first time, and derive excitation parameters by assuming optically-thin and local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) conditions. The LTE model revealed that warmer, HCO$^+$-poorer molecular gas medium is dominated around the eastern nucleus, harboring an AGN. The HCN abundance is remarkably flat ($\sim$3.5 $\times$ 10$^{-9}$) independently of the various environments within the filament of VV 114 (i.e., AGN, star formation, and shock).},

Hence, the [CI] disc has V/sigma$\gt$10 and is not particularly turbulent, similar to local galaxy discs. The dynamical mass (\~{}10\^{}11 Msun) is comparable to the baryonic mass within the errors. This suggests that baryons dominate the inner galaxy dynamics, similar to massive galaxies at z=0. Remarkably, PKS 0529-549 lies on the local baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, indicating that at least some massive galaxies are already in place and kinematically relaxed at z\~{}2.6. This work highlights the potential of the [CI] line to trace galaxy dynamics at high z, as well as the importance of multiwavelength data to interpret gas kinematics.},

  abstract      = {In order to minimize environmental effects and gain an insight into the internal mechanisms that shape the properties of the early-type dwarf systems, we study one of the few isolated dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) of the Local Group (LG): Cetus. We obtained VLT/FORS2 spectra ($R\sim2600$) in the region of the nIR CaII triplet lines for 80 candidate red giant branch stars. The analysis yielded line-of-sight velocities and metallicities ([Fe/H]) for 54 bona fide member stars. The kinematic analysis shows that Cetus is a mainly pressure-supported ($\sigma\_v = 11.0\_{-1.3}^{+1.6}$ km/s), dark-matter-dominated system ($M\_{1/2}/L\_V = 23.9\_{-8.9}^{+9.7} M\_\odot/L\_\odot$) with no significant signs of internal rotation. We find Cetus to be a metal-poor system with a significant [Fe/H] spread (median [Fe/H] = -1.71 dex, median-absolute-deviation = 0.49 dex), as expected for its stellar mass. We report the presence of a mild metallicity gradient compatible with those found in other dSphs of the same luminosity; we trace the presence of a stellar population gradient also in the spatial distribution of stars in different evolutionary phases in ancillary SuprimeCam photometric data. There are tentative indications of two chemo-kinematically distinct sub-populations, with the more metal-poor stars showing a hotter kinematics than the metal-richer ones. Furthermore, the photometric dataset reveals the presence of a foreground population that most likely belongs to the Sagittarius stream. This study represents a first comprehensive analysis of Cetus chemo-kinematic properties. Our results add Cetus to the growing scatter in stellar-dark matter halo properties in low-mass galactic systems. The presence of a metallicity gradient akin to those found in similar systems inhabiting different environments may hint at metallicity gradients in LG early-type dwarfs being driven by internal mechanisms.},

  abstract      = {Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) travel from the Galactic Centre to the dark matter halo of the Milky Way, where they are observed with velocities in excess of the Galactic escape speed. Their trajectories make them a unique probe of the still poorly constrained dark matter component of the Galaxy. In this paper, we present a new method to constrain the Galactic potential with HVSs. The likelihood is constructed by efficiently calculating the local HVS density at any point of the Galaxy by back-propagating the phase space position and quantifying the ejection probability along the orbit. This method is particularly suited to the data from the ESA mission $\{$$\backslash$it Gaia$\}$. Therefore, to showcase our method, we applied it to a simulated $\backslash$Gaia sample of $\sim200$ stars in Galactic potentials with three different dark matter components, parametrized by a spheroidal NFW profile. We find that individual HVSs exhibit a degeneracy in the scale mass-scale radius plane ($M\_s-r\_s$) and are able to measure only the combination $\alpha = M\_s/r\_s^2$, likewise a degeneracy is also present between $\alpha$ and the spheroidal axis-ratio $q$. When the whole sample is considered, both parameters are nailed down with $\{$$\backslash$it sub-percentage$\}$ precision (about $1\\%$ and $0.1\\%$ for $\alpha$ and $q$ respectively) and no systematic bias is observed. This remarkable power to constrain deviations from a symmetric halo is a consequence of the Galactocentric origin of HVSs. To compare our results with other probes, we break the degeneracy in the scale parameters and impose a mass-concentration relation. The result is a competitive precision on the virial mass $M\_{200}$ of about $10\\%$.},

  abstract      = {Archival HST data taken in F606W+F814W of two different fields in the outer regions of NGC 6946 is used to measure a tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distance to the galaxy. We employ a Bayesian maximum-likelihood modeling method that incorporates the completeness of the photometry, and allows us to model the luminosity function of the RGB population. Our two fields provide us with distances of 7.74 $\pm$ 0.42 Mpc and 7.69 $\pm$ 0.50 Mpc, respectively. Our final distance of 7.72 $\pm$ 0.32 Mpc is higher than most values published previously in the literature. This has important implications for supernova measurements, as NGC 6946 is host to the most observed supernovae (10) of any galaxy to date. We find that the supernovae in NGC 6946 are on average $\sim$ 2.3 times more luminous than previous estimates. Our distance gives NGC 6946 a peculiar velocity of $v\_{pec}$ = $-229$ $\pm$ $29$ km/s in the Local Sheet frame. This velocity is the projected component of a substantial negative SGZ motion, indicating a coherent motion along with the other members of the M101 wall toward the plane of the Local Sheet. The M101 wall, a spur off the Local Sheet into the Local Void, is experiencing the expansion of the Local Void.},

We show that the most luminous PNe produce $\gtrsim 1{,}200 \, \rm{L}\_{\odot}$ of power in their [O III] $\lambda 5007$ line, implying central star luminosities of at least $\sim 11{,}000 \, \rm{L}\_{\odot}$. Even with the most recent accelerated-evolution post-AGB models, such luminosities require central star masses in excess of $0.66 \, \rm{M}\_{\odot}$, and main sequence progenitors of at least $\sim 2.5 \, \rm{M}\_{\odot}$. Since M31's bulge has very few intermediate-age stars, we conclude that conventional single-star evolution cannot be responsible for these extremely luminous objects. We also present the circumstellar extinctions for the region's bright PNe and demonstrate that the distribution is similar to that found for PNe in the Large Magellanic Cloud, with a median value of $A\_{5007} = 0.71$. Finally, we compare our results to extinction measurements made for PNe in the E6 elliptical NGC 4697 and the interacting lenticular NGC 5128. We show that such extinctions are not unusual, and that the existence of very high-mass PN central stars is a general feature of old stellar populations. Our results suggest that single-star population synthesis models significantly underestimate the maximum luminosities and total integrated light of AGB stars.},

  abstract      = {We recently inferred that the galaxy NGC1052-DF2 has little or no dark matter and a rich system of unusual globular clusters. We assumed that the galaxy is a satellite of the luminous elliptical galaxy NGC1052 at \~{}20 Mpc, on the basis of its surface brightness fluctuations (SBF) distance of $19.0 \pm 1.7$ Mpc, its radial velocity of \~{}1800 km/s, and its projected position. Trujillo et al. (2018) proposed a much closer distance of 13 Mpc, based largely on a putative detection of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) and a recalibration of our SBF measurement. Here we analyze the CMD using both fully populated galaxy models and other galaxies in our HST sample, and demonstrate that Trujillo et al. almost certainly confused blends for individual red giants in their analysis. These blends produce a ``phantom'' TRGB \~{}2 times brighter than the true TRGB, leading to a \~{}1.4 times smaller inferred distance. The large population of unblended stars on the red giant branch expected for distances of \~{}13 Mpc is not detected in the HST data. We also provide a new distance measurement to NGC1052-DF2 that is free of calibration uncertainties, by anchoring it to a satellite of the megamaser host galaxy NGC4258. From a megamaser-TRGB-SBF distance ladder we obtain $D=18.7 \pm 1.7$ Mpc, consistent with our previous measurement and with the distance to NGC1052.},

We use the abundances from idr2-3, idr4, idr5 data releases of the Gaia-ESO Survey both for Galactic field and open cluster stars.We determine membership and average composition of open clusters and we separate thin and thick disc field stars.We consider the effect of mixing in the abundance of N in giant stars. We compute a grid of chemical evolution models, suited to reproduce the main features of our Galaxy, exploring the effects of the star formation efficiency, the infall time-scale and the differential outflow. With our samples, we map the metallicity range -0.6$\lt$[Fe/H]$\lt$0.3 with a corresponding -1.2$\lt$log(N/O)$\lt$-0.2, where the secondary production of N dominates. Thanks to the wide range of Galactocentric distances covered by our samples, we can distinguish the behaviour of log(N/O) in different parts of the Galaxy. Our spatially resolved results allow us to distinguish differences in the evolution of N/O with Galactocentric radius. Comparing the data with our models, we can characterise the radial regions of our Galaxy. A shorter infall time-scale is needed in the inner regions, while the outer regions need a longer infall time-scale, coupled with a higher star formation efficiency. We compare our results with nebular abundances obtained in MaNGA galaxies, finding in our Galaxy a much wider range of log(N/O) than in integrated observations of external galaxies of similar stellar mass, but similar to the ranges found in studies of individual H ii regions.},

  abstract      = {Recent spectroscopic surveys of the Galactic bulge have unambiguously shown that the bulge contains two main components, that are best separated in their iron content, but also differ in spatial distribution, kinematics, and abundance ratios. The so-called metal poor (MP) component peaks at [Fe/H]\~{}-0.4, while the metal rich (MR) one peaks at [Fe/H]$~+0.3. The total metallicity distribution function is therefore bimodal, with a dip at [Fe/H]~0. The relative fraction of the two components changes significantly across the bulge area. We provide, for the first time, the fractional contribution of the MP and MR stars to the stellar mass budget of the Galactic bulge, and its variation across the bulge area. We find that MP stars make up 48\% of the total stellar mass of the bulge, within the region |l|\lt10, |b|\lt9.5, with the remaining 52\% made up of MR stars. The latter dominate the mass budget at intermediate latitudes |b|~4, but become marginal in the outer bulge (|b|\gt8). The MP component is more axisymmetric than the MR one, and it is at least comparable, and possibly slightly dominant in the inner few degrees. As a result, the MP component, which does not follow the main bar, is not marginal in terms of the total mass budget as previously thought, and this new observational evidence must be included in bulge models. While the total radial velocity dispersion has a trend that follows the total stellar mass, when we examine the velocity dispersion of each component individually, we find that MP stars have higher velocity dispersion where they make up a smaller fraction of the stellar mass, and viceversa. This is due to the kinematical and spatial distribution of the two metallicity component being significantly different, as already discussed in the literature.},

In light of debates over the measured velocity dispersion of its star clusters and the associated mass estimate, we constrain mass models of DF2 using its observed kinematics with a range of priors on the halo mass. Models in which the galaxy obeys a standard stellar-halo mass relation are in tension with the data and also require a large central density core. Better fits are obtained when the halo mass is left free, even after accounting for increased model complexity. The dynamical mass-to-light ratio for our model with a weak prior on the halo mass is $1.7^{+0.7}\_{-0.5} \ M\_\odot / L\_{\odot, V}$, consistent with the stellar population estimate for DF2. We use tidal analysis to find that the low-mass models are consistent with the undisturbed isophotes of DF2. Finally we compare with Local Group dwarf galaxies and demonstrate that DF2 is an outlier in both its spatial extent and its relative dark matter deficit.},

We examine the chemistry, kinematics, and dynamics of this metal-rich halo sample using chemical abundances and radial velocities provided by the fourteenth APOGEE data release (DR14) and proper motions from the second Gaia data release (DR2). The analysis reveals three chemically different stellar populations in the [Mg/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] space -- the two distinct halo populations already reported in the literature, and a third group with intermediate [Mg/Fe] $\sim$+0.1. We derive the $U$, $V$ and $W$ velocity components with respect to the Local Standard of Rest, as well as orbits for the three stellar groups, and find that they differ also in their kinematical and dynamical properties. The high-[Mg/Fe] population exhibits a mean prograde rotation, as well as orbits that are more bound and closer to the plane, whereas the low-[Mg/Fe] population has $\ltV\gt$ closer to 0, and stars that move in less-bound orbits reaching larger distances from the centre and the Galactic plane. The intermediate-Mg stars exhibit different orbital characteristics, moving with a strong prograde rotation and low excentricity, but in less-bound orbits. This stellar population resembles the two stellar overdensities lying about $|z| \sim 5$ kpc recently reported in the literature, for which a disc origin has been claimed.},

  abstract    = {We analyze {\sl Hubble Space Telescope} observations of nine Large Magellanic Cloud star clusters with ages of 1--2 Gyr to search for evolved counterparts of blue straggler stars. Near the red clump regions in the clusters' color--magnitude diagrams, we find branches of evolved stars that are much brighter than normal evolved stars. We examine the effects of photometric artifacts, differential reddening, and field contamination. We conclude that these bright evolved stars cannot be explained by any of these effects. Our statistical tests show that the contributions of photometric uncertainties and crowding effects, as well as that owing to differential reddening, to these bright evolved stars are insufficient to fully explain the presence of these bright evolved stars. Based on isochrone fitting, we also ruled out the possibility that these bright evolved stars could be reproduced by an internal chemical abundance spread. The spatial distributions of the bright evolved stars exhibit clear concentrations that cannot be explained by homogeneously distributed field stars. This is further confirmed based on Monte Carlo-based tests. By comparing our observations with stellar evolution models, we find that the masses of most of bright evolved stars do not exceed twice the average mass of normal evolved stars. We suggest that these bright evolved stars are, in fact, evolved blue straggler stars.},

  title       = {Schwarzschild dynamical model of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy},
  abstract    = {We present a full dynamical model of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy obtained with the spherically symmetric Schwarzschild orbit superposition method applied to the largest kinematic data set presently available. We modelled the total mass content of the dwarf with the mass-to-light ratio $\Upsilon$ varying with radius and found that Fornax is with high probability embedded in a massive and extended dark matter halo. We estimated the total mass contained within 1$\,$kpc to be $M(<1\,$kpc$)=1.25^{+0.06}_{-0.13} \times 10^8\,$M$_{\odot}$. The data are consistent with the constant mass-to-light ratio, i.e. the mass-follows-light model, only at 3$\sigma$ level, but still require a high value of $\Upsilon \approx 11.2\,$M$_{\odot}/$L$_{\odot}$. Our results are in general agreement with previous estimates of the dynamical mass profile of Fornax. As the Schwarzschild method does not require any assumptions on the orbital anisotropy of the stars, we obtained a profile of the anisotropy parameter $\beta$ as an output of our modelling. The derived anisotropy is close to zero in the centre of the galaxy and decreases with radius, but remains consistent with isotropic orbits at all radii at 1$\sigma$ confidence level.},

We detected the CO J=4-3 line at a systemic z(CO)=3.093 {\pm} 0.001 at 11 {\sigma} from one of the ALMA continuum sources associated with the Ly{\alpha} filament. We estimated the CO J=4-3 luminosity of L'CO(4-3)=(2.3\pm0.2)x10^9 K km s^{-1} pc^2 for this CO source, which is one order of magnitude smaller than those of typical z>1 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) of similar far-infrared luminosity L(IR)~10^{12} Lsun. We derived a molecular gas mass of Mgas=(4.4^{+0.9}_{-0.6})x10^9 Msun and a star-formation rate of SFR=270\pm160 Msun yr^{-1}. We also estimated a gas depletion time of {\tau}(dep)=17\pm10 Myr, being shorter than those of typical DSFGs. It is suggested that this source is in a transition phase from DSFG to a gas-poor, early-type galaxy. From ALMA to Herschel multi-band dust continuum observations, we measured a dust emissivity index {\beta}=2.3\pm0.2, which is similar to those of local gas-poor, early-type galaxies. Such a high {\beta} can be reproduced by specific chemical compositions for interstellar dust at the submillimeter wavelengths from recent laboratory experiments. ALMA CO and multi-band dust continuum observations can constrain the evolutionary stage of high-redshift galaxies through {\tau}(dep) and {\beta}, and thus we can investigate dust chemical compositions even in the early Universe.},

  abstract      = {Although the proximity of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) offers an opportunity to understand how mergers affect galaxies, uncertainty remains about M31's most important mergers. Previous studies focused individually on the giant stellar stream or the impact of M32 on M31's disk, thereby suggesting many substantial satellite interactions. Yet models of M31's disk heating and the similarity between the stellar populations of different tidal substructures in M31's outskirts both suggested a single large merger. M31's stellar halo (its outer low-surface-brightness regions) is built up from the tidal debris of satellites and provides information about its important mergers. Here we use cosmological models of galaxy formation to show that M31's massive and metal-rich stellar halo, containing intermediate-age stars, dramatically narrows the range of allowed interactions, requiring a single dominant merger with a large galaxy (with stellar mass about 2.5 x 10\^{}10 solar masses, the third largest member of the Local Group) about 2 Gyr ago. This single event explains many observations that were previously considered separately: M31's compact and metal-rich satellite M32 is likely to be the stripped core of the disrupted galaxy, its rotating inner stellar halo contains most of the merger debris, and the giant stellar stream is likely to have been thrown out during the merger. This interaction may explain M31's global burst of star formation about 2 Gyr ago in which approximately a fifth of its stars were formed. Moreover, M31's disk and bulge were already in place, suggesting that mergers of this magnitude need not dramatically affect galaxy structure.},

  abstract      = {We continue the analysis of the dataset of our spectroscopic observation campaign of M31, by deriving simple stellar population properties (age metallicity and alpha-elements overabundance) from the measurement of Lick/IDS absorption line indices. We describe their two-dimensional maps taking into account the dust distribution in M31. 80$\backslash$\% of the values of our age measurements are larger than 10 Gyr. The central 100 arcsec of M31 are dominated by the stars of the classical bulge of M31. They are old (11-13 Gyr), metal-rich (as high as [Z/H]\~{}0.35 dex) at the center with a negative gradient outwards and enhanced in alpha-elements ([alpha/Fe]\~{} 0.28+- 0.01 dex). The bar stands out in the metallicity map, where an almost solar value of [Z/H] (\~{}0.02+-0.01 dex) with no gradient is observed along the bar position angle (55.7 deg) out to 600 arcsec from the center. In contrast, no signature of the bar is seen in the age and [alpha/Fe] maps, that are approximately axisymmetric, delivering a mean age and overabundance for the bar and the boxy-peanut bulge of 10-13 Gyr and 0.25-0.27 dex, respectively. The boxy/peanut-bulge has almost solar metallicity (-0.04+- 0.01 dex). The mass-to-light ratio of the three components is approximately constant at M/LV \~{} 4.4-4.7 Msol/Lsol. The disk component at larger distances is made of a mixture of stars, as young as 3-4 Gyr, with solar metallicity and smaller M/LV (\~{}3+-0.1 Msol/Lsol). We propose a two-phase formation scenario for the inner region of M31, where most of the stars of the classical bulge come into place together with a proto-disk, where a bar develops and quickly transforms it into a boxy-peanut bulge. Star formation continues in the bulge region, producing stars younger than 10 Gyr, in particular along the bar, enhancing its metallicity. The disk component appears to build up on longer time-scales.},

  month         = jul,
  abstract      = {The ellipsoid of stellar random motions is a fundamental ingredient of galaxy dynamics. Yet it has long been difficult to constrain it in disks others than the Milky Way. This article presents the modeling of the azimuthal-to-radial axis ratio of the velocity ellipsoid of galactic disks from stellar dispersion maps using integral field spectroscopy data of the CALIFA survey. The measured azimuthal anisotropy is shown not strongly dependent on the assumed vertical-to-radial dispersion ratio of the ellipsoid. The anisotropy distribution shows a large diversity in the orbital structure of disk galaxies, from tangential to radial stellar orbits. Globally, the orbits are isotropic in inner disk regions, and become more radial as function of radius, though this picture tends to depend on galaxy morphology and luminosity. The Milky Way orbital anisotropy profile measured from the Second Gaia Data Release is consistent with those of CALIFA galaxies. A new correlation is evidenced, linking the absolute magnitude or the stellar mass of the disks to the azimuthal anisotropy. More (less) luminous disks have more radial (isotropic and somewhat tangential, respectively) orbits. This correlation is consistent with the picture in galaxy evolution in which orbits become more radial as the mass grows and is redistributed as function of time. With the help of circular velocity curves, it is also shown that the epicycle theory fails to reproduce the diversity of azimuthal anisotropy of stellar random motions, as it predicts only nearly radial orbits in presence of flat curves. The origin of this conflict is yet to be identified. It also questions the validity of the vertical-to-radial axis ratio of the velocity ellipsoid derived by many studies in the framework of the epicyclic approximation.},

  abstract      = {We construct a model for the Milky-Way Galaxy composed of a stellar disc and bulge embedded in a dark-matter halo. All components are modeled as $N$-body systems with up to 8 billion equal-mass particles and integrated up to an age of 10Gyr. We find that net angular-momentum of the dark-matter halo with a spin parameter of $\lambda=0.06$ is required to form a relatively short bar ($\sim 4$kpc) with a high pattern speed (40--50kms$^{-1}$). By comparing our model with observations of the Milky Way Galaxy, we conclude that a disc mass of $\sim 3.7\times10^{10}M\_{\odot}$ and an initial bulge scale length and velocity of $\sim 1$kpc and $\sim 300$kms$^{-1}$, respectively, fit best to the observations. The disc-to-total mass fraction ($f\_{\rm d}$) appears to be an important parameter for the evolution of the Galaxy and models with $f\_{\rm d}\sim 0.45$ are most similar to the Milky Way Galaxy. In addition, we compare the velocity distribution in the solar neighbourhood in our simulations with observations in the Milky Way Galaxy. In our simulations the observed gap in the velocity distribution, which is expected to be caused by the outer Lindblad resonance (the so-called Hercules stream), appears to be a time-dependent structure. The velocity distribution changes on a time scale of 20--30Myr and therefore it is difficult to estimate the pattern speed of the bar from the shape of the local velocity distribution alone.},

We also investigate the detailed distribution of dust in the nuclear region, a prominent feature of which is a \~{} 500 pc bar-like structure seen previously in H$\{$$\backslash$alpha$\}$. The nature of this feature has been the subject of some debate. Our maps show it to be the site of the warmest dust, with a mean line-of-sight temperature \~{} 30 K. A comparison with the stellar distribution, based on 2MASS data, provides strong evidence that it is a gravitationally induced bar. A comparison with radial velocity maps suggests the presence of an inflow towards the nucleus from opposite directions along this bar, fed presumably by the nuclear spiral with which it appears to connect. Such behaviour is common in large-scale bars in spiral galaxies, as is the phenomenon of nested bars whereby a subkiloparsec nuclear bar exists within a large-scale primary bar. We suggest that M31 represents an example of such nesting.},

The star was observed in [O I] 63 $\mu$m and [C II] 158 $\mu$m with high velocity resolution with upGREAT on SOFIA. The velocity resolved [O I] emission provides evidence for a large gas-disk, $\sim$ 760 au in size, around HD 50138. Whereas previous interferometric observations give strong evidence for a hot gas and dust disk in Keplerian rotation, our bservations are the first to provide unambiguous evidence for a large warm disk around the star. Herschel/PACS observations showed that the [C II] emission is extended, therefore the [C II] emission most likely originates in an ionized gas shell created by a past outflow event. We confirm the isolated nature of HD 50138. It is far from any star forming region and has low proper motion. Neither is there any sign of a remnant cloud from which it could have formed. The extended disk around the star appears carbon poor. It shows OH and [O I] emission, but no CO. The CO abundance appears to be at least an order of magnitude lower than that of OH. Furthermore $^{13}$CO is enriched by more than a factor of five, confirming that the star is not a Herbig Be star. Finally we note that our high spectral resolution [O I] and [C II] observations provide a very accurate heliocentric velocity of the star, 40.8 $\pm$ 0.2 km\~{}s$^{-1}$.},

Forward modeling of the deep photometry allows us to refine the structural and photometric properties of Dra II: the distribution of stars in colour-magnitude space implies Dra II is old (13.5 $ \pm 0.5 $ Gyr), very metal poor, very faint ($ L\_V = 180 ^{+124}\_{-72} L\_\odot $), and at a distance $d = 21.5 \pm 0.4$ kpc. The narrow-band, metallicity-sensitive CaHK Pristine photometry confirms this very low metallicity ([Fe/H]$ = -2.7 \pm 0.1$ dex). Even though our study benefits from a doubling of the spectroscopic sample size compared to previous investigations, the velocity dispersion of the system is still only marginally resolved ($\sigma\_{vr}\lt5.9$ km s$^{-1}$ at the 95 per cent confidence level) and confirms that Dra II is a dynamically cold stellar system with a large recessional velocity ($\langle v\_{r}\rangle = -342.5^{+1.1}\_{-1.2} $ km s$^{-1}$). We further show that the spectroscopically confirmed members of Dra\~{}II have a mean proper motion of $(\mu\_\alpha^*,\mu\_\delta)=(1.26 \pm 0.27,0.94 \pm 0.28) $ mas yr$^{-1}$ in the Gaia DR2 data, which translates to an orbit with a pericenter and an apocenter of $20.9 ^{+0.7}\_{-0.9}$ and $184.5 ^{+356.4}\_{-134.6}$ kpc, respectively. Taken altogether, these properties favour the scenario of Dra\~{}II being a potentially disrupting dwarf galaxy.

We conducted a variability search in the V and I filters using three variability indexes: the median absolute deviation, the interquartile range and the inverse von-Neumann ratio. This analysis yielded 120 new variable candidates with absolute magnitudes ranging from M$\_{V}$ = $-$4 to $-$11 mag. We used the MESA evolutionary tracks at solar metallicity, to classify the variables based on their absolute magnitude and their position on the color-magnitude diagram.

Spanning \~{} 2 kpc in radius, it has a peak surface brightness of $\mu\_B$=28.8 mag/arcsec$^2$, making it the lowest surface brightness object ever detected via integrated light. Although the object is extremely gas-rich, with a gas fraction of $f\_g$=0.99, its peak HI column density is well below levels where star formation is typically observed in galaxies. Nonetheless, BST1047+1156 shows evidence for young stellar populations: along with the detected UV emission, the object is extremely blue, with B-V=0.14$\pm$0.09. The object sports two tidal tails and is found embedded within diffuse gas connecting the spiral galaxy M96 to the group's extended HI Leo Ring. The nature of BST1047+1156 is unclear. It could be a disrupting tidal dwarf, recently spawned from star formation triggered in the Leo I Group's tidal debris. Alternatively, the object may have been a pre-existing galaxy --- the most extreme example of a gas-rich field LSB known to date --- which had a recent burst of star formation triggered by encounters in the group environment.},

  abstract      = {It has recently become apparent that a large component of the nearby Galactic halo may be formed from a single massive accretion event. Here, we study APOGEE DR14 element abundances and $\textit{Gaia}$ DR2 kinematics of stars associated with the accreted stellar halo. We show that the nearby halo has many stars with high orbital eccentricities ($e\gtrsim0.8$), whose abundances differ from that of their low $e$ counterparts. High $e$ stars exhibit abundance patterns typical of massive Milky Way dwarf galaxy satellites today, characterised by low [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [Ni/Fe]. The [Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H] trend of high $e$ stars shows a change of slope at [Fe/H]$\sim-1.3$, also characteristic of chemical evolution in relatively massive dwarf galaxies. Low $e$ stars do not show a significant break in the same [Fe/H] range, and exhibit slightly higher abundances of Mg, Al and Ni. Other kinematical properties of the high and low $e$ stars also differ, with the former exhibiting slightly retrograde motion, higher vertical excursions, and larger apocentre radii. We use the EAGLE suite of cosmological simulations to show that the high $e$ population likely results from the accretion of a satellite with $10^{8}\lesssim M\_*\lesssim 10^{9}\mathrm{M\_\odot}$, at $z\lesssim1.5$. The simulations further suggest that accretion events like this are a rare occurrence in the evolutionary history of Milky Way-like galaxies. In addition, we examine how eccentricity changes over time in accreted stellar debris, finding that median $e$ is largely unchanged since merger time. The exact nature of the low $e$ population is unclear, but we hypothesise that it is likely a combination of $\textit{in situ}$ star formation, high $|z|$ disc stars, lower mass accretion events, and contamination by the low $e$ tail of the high $e$ population.},

We cross-check this new DIB-based line-of-sight velocity map with the map derived in Paper I and find that they agree. We then compare these maps with line-of-sight velocity maps derived from simulations of quasi-stationary density wave spiral structure and dynamic, or material, spiral structure in a Milky Way-like galaxy. While none of the maps derived from these simulations is an exact match to the measured velocity field of the Milky Way, the measurements are more consistent with simulations of dynamic spiral structure. In the dynamic spiral structure simulation that best matches the measurements, the Perseus spiral arm is being disrupted.},

  year          = {2018},
  month         = aug,
  abstract      = {It has long been known that the vertical motions of Galactic disk stars near the Sun increase with stellar age, commonly interpreted as vertical heating through orbit scattering of stars once born from a settled gas disk. Here we map the vertical motions of disk stars as a function of age ($\tau$ $\lt$ 8 Gyrs) and across a large range of Galactocentric radii, 3 kpc $\lt$ $R\_{\rm GC}$ $\lt$ 14 kpc. We quantify these motions by the stars' vertical actions $J\_z$, as those should be invariant under radial migration and the adiabatic mass build up of the disk. The analysis draws on APOGEE and Gaia data to determine precise distances (7\%), stellar ages (25\%) and vertical actions (15\%) for a sample of \~{}20,000 red clump stars. The inferred birth temperature, $\widehat{J\_{z,0}}$ is 0.7 kpc km/s for 3 kpc $\lt$ $R\_{\rm GC}$ $\lt$ 10 kpc, consistent with the ISM velocity dispersion; but it rapidly rises outward, to 8 kpc km/s for $R\_{\rm GC}$ = 14 kpc, likely reflecting the stars' birth in a warped or flared gas disk. The stellar age dependence $\gamma$ gently grows with Galactocentric radius, from $\gamma$ = 1 for $R\_{\rm GC} \lt R\_\odot$ to $\gamma$ = 1.3 at $R\_{\rm GC}$ = 14 kpc. The observed $J\_z - \tau$ relation at all radii is considerably steeper ($\gamma\gtrsim 1$) than the time dependence theoretically expected from orbit scattering, $J\_z\propto t^{0.5}$. We build a simple analytic model to illustrate how this conundrum can be resolved, still presuming that orbit scattering drives the $J\_z$ evolution if we account for the fact that at earlier epochs the scatterers (e.g. GMCs) were more common, and the restoring force from the stellar disk surface mass density was low. This model can explain all qualitative trends seen in our $\widehat{J\_z}(R\_{\rm GC},\tau)$. Our analysis may re-instate gradual orbital scattering as a plausible and viable mechanism to explain the age-dependent vertical motions of disk stars.},

  abstract      = {HST/ACS observations along the major axis of M33 show that the mean age of its stars decreases with increasing distance from the galaxy center. Such a behavior is consistent with an inside-out growth of the disc. However, in the outermost observed field, at r$\simeq$11.6 kpc, a reversal of this gradient is detected, with old stars found in high percentages beyond this radius. In this work we investigate the origin of such a reversal in stellar age gradient, by using a simulated M33 analogue from the Constrained Local UniversE Simulations (CLUES). The simulated M33 is similar to the observed one in terms of mass, rotation velocity, surface brightness and, similar to what has been reported in observations, shows a stellar age turnaround at large radii. We demonstrate that this reversal is mostly a result of stellar accretion from old satellite galaxies and, to a lesser extent, of stellar migration of in-situ stars. The old accreted stars, with formation times tf $\lt$ 4 Gyrs, are kinematically hot and can be differentiated from the in-situ stars by their high velocity dispersion and the fact that they do not have rotationally-supported orbits. In the future, obtaining kinematic information of the stars in the outskirt of M33 will help to verify this scenario.},

Although the halo was once considered a single component, evidence for its dichotomy has slowly emerged in recent years from inspection of small samples of halo objects. Here we show that the halo is indeed clearly divisible into two broadly overlapping structural components-an inner and an outer halo-that exhibit different spatial density profiles, stellar orbits and stellar metallicities (abundances of elements heavier than helium). The inner halo has a modest net prograde rotation, whereas the outer halo exhibits a net retrograde rotation and a peak metallicity one-third that of the inner halo. These properties indicate that the individual halo components probably formed in fundamentally different ways, through successive dissipational (inner) and dissipationless (outer) mergers and tidal disruption of proto-Galactic clumps.},

  abstract      = {It has been suggested that the well-studied giant HII regions M16 and M17 may have had a common origin, being an example of large-scale triggered star formation. While some features of the distribution of the interstellar medium in the region support this interpretation, no definitive detection of an earlier population of massive stars responsible for the triggering has been made thus far. We have carried out observations looking for red supergiants in the area covered by a giant shell seen in HI and CO centered on galactic coordinates $l \sim 14^\circ 5$, $b\sim +1^\circ$ that peaks near the same radial velocity as the bulk of the emission from both giant HII regions, which are located along the shell. Red supergiants have ages in the range expected for the parent association whose most massive members could have triggered the formation of the shell and of the giant HII regions along its rim. Out of a sample of 37 bright red stars, we identify four red supergiants that confirm the existence of massive stars in the age range between $\sim 10$ and $\sim 30$\~{}Myr in the area. At least three of them have Gaia DR2 parallaxes consistent with them being at the same distance as M16 and M17. The evidence of past massive star formation within the area of the gaseous shell lends support to the idea that it was formed by the combined action of stellar winds and ionizing radiation of the precursors of the current red supergiants. These could be the remnants of a richer population, whose most massive members have exploded already as core-collapse supernovae. The expansion of the shell against the surrounding medium, perhaps combined with the overrun of preexisting clouds, is thus a plausible trigger of the formation of a second generation of stars currently responsible for the ionization of M16 and M17.},

  abstract      = {The halos of disk galaxies form a crucial connection between the galaxy disk and the intergalactic medium. Massive stars, HII regions, or dwarf galaxies located in the halos of galaxies are potential tracers of recent accretion and/or outflows of gas, and are additional contributors to the photon field and the gas phase metallicity. We investigate the nature and origin of a star-forming dwarf galaxy candidate located in the halo of the edge-on Virgo galaxy NGC 4634 with a projected distance of 1.4 kpc and a H$\alpha$ star formation rate of $\sim 4.7 \times 10^{-3} \text{M}\_\odot \text{yr}^{-1}$ in order to increase our understanding of these disk-halo processes. With optical long-slit spectra we measured fluxes of optical nebula emission lines to derive the oxygen abundance 12 + log(O/H) of an HII region in the disk of NGC 4634 and in the star-forming dwarf galaxy candidate. Abundances derived from optical long-slit data and from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) r-band data, H$\alpha$ data, Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) HI data, and photometry of SDSS and GALEX data were used for further analysis. With additional probes of the luminosity-metallicity relation in the $B$-band from the H$\alpha$-luminosity, the HI map, and the relative velocities, we are able to constrain a possible origin of the dwarf galaxy candidate. The high oxygen abundance (12 + log(O/H) $\approx$ 8.72) of the dwarf galaxy candidate leads to the conclusion that it was formed from pre-enriched material. Analysis of auxiliary data shows that the dwarf galaxy candidate is composed of material originating from NGC 4634. We cannot determine whether this material has been ejected tidally or through other processes, which makes the system highly interesting for follow up observations.},

This anatomical procedure exposes two large diffuse over-densities aligned with the semi-major axis of the halo: the Hercules-Aquila Cloud and the Virgo Over-density. We reveal the kinematics of the entire inner halo by mapping out the amplitudes and directions of the RR Lyrae proper motions. These are then compared to simple models with different anisotropies to demonstrate that the inner halo is dominated by stars on highly eccentric orbits. We interpret the shape of the density and the kinematics of the $Gaia$ DR2 RR Lyrae as evidence in favour of a scenario in which the bulk of the halo was deposited in a single massive merger event.},

However, only a partial census of the MW's complement of satellite galaxies exists because surveys of the MW's close environs are incomplete both in depth and in sky coverage. We present a new Bayesian analysis that combines the sample of satellites recently discovered by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) with those found in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to estimate the total satellite galaxy luminosity function down to $M\_{\rm V}=0$. We find that there should be at least $124^{+40}\_{-27}$ ($68\\%$ CL, statistical error) satellites as bright or brighter than $M\_{\rm V}=0$ within 300 kpc of the Sun, with only a weak dependence on MW halo mass. When it comes online the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope should detect approximately half of this population. We also show that WDM models infer the same number of satellites as in $\Lambda$CDM, which will allow us to rule out those models that produce insufficient substructure to be viable.},

We aim to understand the chemical evolution of r-process elements in Milky Way disc. We focus on three pure r-process elements Eu, Gd, and Dy. Using high-resolution FEROS, HARPS, and UVES spectra from the ESO archive, we perform a homogeneous analysis on 6500 FGK Milky Way stars, thanks to the automatic optimization pipeline GAUGUIN. We present abundances of Ba (5057 stars), Eu (6268 stars), Gd (5431 stars), and Dy (5479 stars). We chemically characterize the thin and the thick discs, and a metal-rich alpha-rich population. We find that the [Eu/Fe] ratio follows a continuous sequence from the thin disc to the thick disc as a function of the metallicity. In thick disc stars, the [Eu/Ba] ratio is found to be constant, while the [Gd/Ba] and [Dy/Ba] ratios decrease as a function of the metallicity. These observations clearly indicate a different nucleosynthesis history in the thick disc between Eu and Gd-Dy. We also find that the alpha-rich metal-rich stars are also enriched in r-process elements (like thick disc stars), but their [Ba/Fe] is very different from thick disc stars. Finally, we find that the [r/$\backslash$alpha] ratio tends to decrease with metallicity, indicating that supernovae of different properties probably contribute differently to the synthesis of r-process elements and $\backslash$alpha-elements. We provide average abundance trends for [Ba/Fe] and [Eu/Fe] with rather small dispersions, and for the first time for [Gd/Fe] and [Dy/Fe]. This data may help to constrain chemical evolution models of Milky Way r- and s-process elements and the yields of massive stars. Including yields of neutron-star or black hole mergers is now crucial if we want to quantitatively compare observations to Galactic chemical evolution models.},

The data presented here -- a small subset of the full survey -- uniformly covers a region of 25 square degrees centered on the galaxy to a depth of g \~{} 23.5. We use this data to study the structural properties of Fornax, overall stellar population, and its member stars in different evolutionary phases. We also search for possible signs of tidal disturbance. Fornax is found to be significantly more spatially extended than what early studies suggested. No statistically significant distortions or signs of tidal disturbances were found down to a surface brightness limit of \~{}32.1 mag/arcsec\^{}2. However, there are hints of shell-like features located \~{}30' - 40' from the center of Fornax that may be stellar debris from past merger events. We also find that intermediate age and young main-sequence populations show different orientation at the galaxy center and have many substructures. The deep DES Y3 data allows us to characterize the age of those substructures with great accuracy, both those previously known and those newly discovered in this work, on the basis of their color-magnitude diagram morphology. We find that the youngest overdensities are all found on the Eastern side of Fornax, where the Fornax field population itself is slightly younger than in the West. The high quality DES Y3 data reveals that Fornax has many rich structures, and provides insights into its complex formation history.},
