All these fields have a wealth of publicly available imaging data sets in addition to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data, which makes it possible to construct the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of objects over a wide wavelength range. In this paper we describe a photometric analysis of the CANDELS and 3D-HST HST imaging and the ancillary imaging data at wavelengths 0.3-8 μm. Objects were selected in the WFC3 near-IR bands, and their SEDs were determined by carefully taking the effects of the point-spread function in each observation into account. A total of 147 distinct imaging data sets were used in the analysis. The photometry is made available in the form of six catalogs: one for each field, as well as a master catalog containing all objects in the entire survey. We also provide derived data products: photometric redshifts, determined with the EAZY code, and stellar population parameters determined with the FAST code. We make all the imaging data that were used in the analysis available, including our reductions of the WFC3 imaging in all five fields. 3D-HST is a spectroscopic survey with the WFC3 and ACS grisms, and the photometric catalogs presented here constitute a necessary first step in the analysis of these grism data. All the data presented in this paper are available through the 3D-HST Web site (http://3dhst.research.yale.edu).},

  abstract = {We present 3D-HST, a near-infrared spectroscopic Treasury program with the Hubble Space Telescope for studying the physical processes that shape galaxies in the distant universe. 3D-HST provides rest-frame optical spectra for a sample of ~7000 galaxies at 1 < z < 3.5, the epoch when ~60% of all star formation took place, the number density of quasars peaked, the first galaxies stopped forming stars, and the structural regularity that we see in galaxies today must have emerged. 3D-HST will cover three quarters (625 arcmin 2 ) of the CANDELS Treasury survey area with two orbits of primary WFC3/G141 grism coverage and two to four orbits with the ACS/G800L grism in parallel. In the IR, these exposure times yield a continuum signal-to-noise ratio of ~5 per resolution element at H 140 ~ 23.1 and a 5σ emission-line sensitivity of ~5 × 10 –17 erg s –1 cm –2 for typical objects, improving by a factor of ~2 for compact sources in images with low sky background levels. The WFC3/G141 spectra provide continuous wavelength coverage from 1.1 to 1.6 μm at a spatial resolution of ~0 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/farcs.gif] {farcs} 13, which, combined with their depth, makes them a unique resource for studying galaxy evolution. We present an overview of the preliminary reduction and analysis of the grism observations, including emission-line and redshift measurements from combined fits to the extracted grism spectra and photometry from ancillary multi-wavelength catalogs. The present analysis yields redshift estimates with a precision of σ( z ) = 0.0034(1 + z ), or σ( v ) ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 1000 km s –1 . We illustrate how the generalized nature of the survey yields near-infrared spectra of remarkable quality for many different types of objects, including a quasar at z = 4.7, quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2, and the most distant T-type brown dwarf star known. The combination of the CANDELS and 3D-HST surveys will provide the definitive imaging and spectroscopic data set for studies of the 1 < z < 3.5 universe until the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope .},

  abstract    = {We analyze the >4-sigma sources in the most sensitive 100 arcmin^2 area (rms <0.56 mJy) of a SCUBA-2 850 micron survey of the GOODS-S and present the 75 band 7 ALMA sources (>4.5-sigma) obtained from high-resolution interferometric follow-up observations. The SCUBA-2---and hence ALMA---samples should be complete to 2.25 mJy. Of the 53 SCUBA-2 sources in this complete sample, only five have no ALMA detections, while 13% (68% confidence range 7-19%) have multiple ALMA counterparts. Color-based high-redshift dusty galaxy selection techniques find at most 55% of the total ALMA sample. In addition to using literature spectroscopic and optical/NIR photometric redshifts, we estimate FIR photometric redshifts based on an Arp 220 template. We identify seven z>4 candidates. We see the expected decline with redshift of the 4.5 micron and 24 micron to 850 micron flux ratios, confirming these as good diagnostics of z>4 candidates. We visually classify 52 ALMA sources, finding 44% (68% confidence range 35-53%) to be apparent mergers. We calculate rest-frame 2-8 keV and 8-28 keV luminosities using the 7 Ms Chandra X-ray image. Nearly all of the ALMA sources detected at 0.5-2 keV are consistent with a known X-ray luminosity to 850 micron flux relation for star-forming galaxies, while most of those detected at 2-7 keV are moderate luminosity AGNs that lie just above the 2-7 keV detection threshold. The latter largely have substantial obscurations of log N_H = 23-24 cm^-2, but two of the high-redshift candidates may even be Compton thick.},

MaNGA will investigate the internal kinematic structure and composition of gas and stars in an unprecedented sample of 10,000 nearby galaxies. We summarize essential characteristics of the instrument and survey design in the context of MaNGA's key science goals and present prototype observations to demonstrate MaNGA's scientific potential. MaNGA employs dithered observations with 17 fiber-bundle integral field units that vary in diameter from 12'' (19 fibers) to 32'' (127 fibers). Two dual-channel spectrographs provide simultaneous wavelength coverage over 3600-10300 Å at R ~ 2000. With a typical integration time of 3 hr, MaNGA reaches a target r -band signal-to-noise ratio of 4-8 (Å –1 per 2'' fiber) at 23 AB mag arcsec –2 , which is typical for the outskirts of MaNGA galaxies.

  abstract    = {The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) III project, has provided the largest survey of galaxy redshifts available to date, in terms of both the number of galaxy redshifts measured by a single survey, and the effective cosmological volume covered. Key to analysing the clustering of these data to provide cosmological measurements is understanding the detailed properties of this sample. Potential issues include variations in the target catalogue caused by changes either in the targeting algorithm or properties of the data used, the pattern of spectroscopic observations, the spatial distribution of targets for which redshifts were not obtained, and variations in the target sky density due to observational systematics. We document here the target selection algorithms used to create the galaxy samples that comprise BOSS. We also present the algorithms used to create large scale structure catalogues for the final Data Release (DR12) samples and the associated random catalogues that quantify the survey mask. The algorithms are an evolution of those used by the BOSS team to construct catalogues from earlier data, and have been designed to accurately quantify the galaxy sample. The code used, designated MKSAMPLE, is released with this paper.},

  title       = {The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey of SDSS-III},
  abstract    = {The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) is designed to measure the scale of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of matter over a larger volume than the combined efforts of all previous spectroscopic surveys of large scale structure. BOSS uses 1.5 million luminous galaxies as faint as i=19.9 over 10,000 square degrees to measure BAO to redshifts z<0.7. Observations of neutral hydrogen in the Lyman alpha forest in more than 150,000 quasar spectra (g<22) will constrain BAO over the redshift range 2.15<z<3.5. Early results from BOSS include the first detection of the large-scale three-dimensional clustering of the Lyman alpha forest and a strong detection from the Data Release 9 data set of the BAO in the clustering of massive galaxies at an effective redshift z = 0.57. We project that BOSS will yield measurements of the angular diameter distance D_A to an accuracy of 1.0% at redshifts z=0.3 and z=0.57 and measurements of H(z) to 1.8% and 1.7% at the same redshifts. Forecasts for Lyman alpha forest constraints predict a measurement of an overall dilation factor that scales the highly degenerate D_A(z) and H^{-1}(z) parameters to an accuracy of 1.9% at z~2.5 when the survey is complete. Here, we provide an overview of the selection of spectroscopic targets, planning of observations, and analysis of data and data quality of BOSS.},

All the data from SDSS-III are now made public. In particular, this paper describes Data Release 11 (DR11) including all data acquired through 2013 July, and Data Release 12 (DR12) adding data acquired through 2014 July (including all data included in previous data releases), marking the end of SDSS-III observing. Relative to our previous public release (DR10), DR12 adds one million new spectra of galaxies and quasars from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) over an additional 3000 sq. deg of sky, more than triples the number of H-band spectra of stars as part of the Apache Point Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), and includes repeated accurate radial velocity measurements of 5500 stars from the Multi-Object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanet Large-area Survey (MARVELS). The APOGEE outputs now include measured abundances of 15 different elements for each star. In total, SDSS-III added 2350 sq. deg of ugriz imaging; 155,520 spectra of 138,099 stars as part of the Sloan Exploration of Galactic Understanding and Evolution 2 (SEGUE-2) survey; 2,497,484 BOSS spectra of 1,372,737 galaxies, 294,512 quasars, and 247,216 stars over 9376 sq. deg; 618,080 APOGEE spectra of 156,593 stars; and 197,040 MARVELS spectra of 5,513 stars.

  abstract    = {The extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) is one of the first of a new generation of galaxy redshift surveys that will cover a large range in redshift with sufficient resolution to measure the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) signal. For surveys covering a large redshift range we can no longer ignore cosmological evolution, meaning that either the redshift shells analysed have to be significantly narrower than the survey, or we have to allow for the averaging over evolving quantities. Both of these have the potential to remove signal: analysing small volumes increases the size of the Fourier window function, reducing the large-scale information, while averaging over evolving quantities can, if not performed carefully, remove differential information. It will be important to measure cosmological evolution from these surveys to explore and discriminate between models. We apply a method to optimally extract this differential information to mock catalogues designed to mimic the eBOSS quasar sample. By applying a set of weights to extract redshift space distortion measurements as a function of redshift, we demonstrate an analysis that does not invoke the problems discussed above. We show that our estimator gives unbiased constraints.},

  title       = {The Fourteenth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: First Spectroscopic Data from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey and from the second phase of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment},
  abstract    = {The fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) has been in operation since July 2014. This paper describes the second data release from this phase, and the fourteenth from SDSS overall (making this, Data Release Fourteen or DR14). This release makes public data taken by SDSS-IV in its first two years of operation (July 2014-2016). Like all previous SDSS releases, DR14 is cumulative, including the most recent reductions and calibrations of all data taken by SDSS since the first phase began operations in 2000. New in DR14 is the first public release of data from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS); the first data from the second phase of the Apache Point Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-2), including stellar parameter estimates from an innovative data driven machine learning algorithm known as "The Cannon"; and almost twice as many data cubes from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey as were in the previous release (N = 2812 in total). This paper describes the location and format of the publicly available data from SDSS-IV surveys. We provide references to the important technical papers describing how these data have been taken (both targeting and observation details) and processed for scientific use. The SDSS website (www.sdss.org) has been updated for this release, and provides links to data downloads, as well as tutorials and examples of data use. SDSS-IV is planning to continue to collect astronomical data until 2020, and will be followed by SDSS-V.},

  abstract = {In the course of its commissioning observations, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has produced one of the largest redshift samples of galaxies selected from CCD images. Using 11,275 galaxies complete to r * = 17.6 over 140 deg 2 , we compute the luminosity function of galaxies in the r * band over a range -23 < M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/121/5/2358/img1.gif] < -16 (for h = 1). The result is well-described by a Schechter function with parameters ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/phi.gif] {phi} * = (1.46 ± 0.12) × 10 -2 h 3 Mpc -3 , M * = -20.83 ± 0.03, and α = -1.20 ± 0.03. The implied luminosity density in r * is j ≈ (2.6 ± 0.3) × 10 8 h L ⊙ Mpc -3 . We find that the surface brightness selection threshold has a negligible impact for M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/121/5/2358/img1.gif] < -18. Using subsets of the data, we measure the luminosity function in the u *, g *, i *, and z * bands as well; the slope at low luminosities ranges from α = -1.35 to α = -1.2. We measure the bivariate distribution of r * luminosity with half-light surface brightness, intrinsic g *- r * color, and morphology. In agreement with previous studies, we find that high surface brightness, red, highly concentrated galaxies are on average more luminous than low surface brightness, blue, less concentrated galaxies. An important feature of the SDSS luminosity function is the use of Petrosian magnitudes, which measure a constant fraction of a galaxy's total light regardless of the amplitude of its surface brightness profile. If we synthesize results for R GKC band or b j band using these Petrosian magnitudes, we obtain luminosity densities 2 times that found by the Las Campanas Redshift Survey in R GKC and 1.4 times that found by the Two Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey in b j . However, we are able to reproduce the luminosity functions obtained by these surveys if we also mimic their isophotal limits for defining galaxy magnitudes, which are shallower and more redshift dependent than the Petrosian magnitudes used by the SDSS.},

  abstract = {In a six-year program started in 2014 July, the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) will conduct novel cosmological observations using the BOSS spectrograph at Apache Point Observatory. These observations will be conducted simultaneously with the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS) designed for variability studies and the Spectroscopic Identification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS) program designed for studies of X-ray sources. In particular, eBOSS will measure with percent-level precision the distance-redshift relation with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of matter. eBOSS will use four different tracers of the underlying matter density field to vastly expand the volume covered by BOSS and map the large-scale-structures over the relatively unconstrained redshift range0.6 < z < 2.2. Using more than 250,000 new, spectroscopically confirmed luminous red galaxies at a median redshift z = 0.72, we project that eBOSS will yield measurements of the angular diameter distance d A ( z ) to an accuracy of 1.2% and measurements of H ( z ) to 2.1% when combined with the z > 0.6 sample of BOSS galaxies. With ∼195,000 new emission line galaxy redshifts, we expect BAO measurements of d A ( z ) to an accuracy of 3.1% and H ( z ) to 4.7% at an effective redshift of z = 0.87. A sample of more than 500,000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars will provide the first BAO distance measurements over the redshift range0.9 < z < 2.2, with expected precision of 2.8% and 4.2% on d A ( z ) and H ( z ), respectively. Finally, with 60,000 new quasars and re-observation of 60,000 BOSS quasars, we will obtain new Ly α forest measurements at redshifts z > 2.1; these new data will enhance the precision of d A ( z ) and H ( z ) at z > 2.1 by a factor of 1.44 relative to BOSS. Furthermore, eBOSS will provide improved tests of General Relativity on cosmological scales through redshift-space distortion measurements, improved tests for non-Gaussianity in the primordial density field, and new constraints on the summed mass of all neutrino species. Here, we provide an overview of the cosmological goals, spectroscopic target sample, demonstration of spectral quality from early data, and projected cosmological constraints from eBOSS.},

  title       = {The SDSS-IV extended Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey: Luminous Red Galaxy Target Selection},
  abstract    = {We describe the algorithm used to select the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample for the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV) using photometric data from both the SDSS and the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). LRG targets are required to meet a set of color selection criteria and have z-band and i-band MODEL magnitudes z < 19.95 and 19.9 < i < 21.8, respectively. Our algorithm selects roughly 50 LRG targets per square degree, the great majority of which lie in the redshift range 0.6 < z < 1.0 (median redshift 0.71). We demonstrate that our methods are highly effective at eliminating stellar contamination and lower-redshift galaxies. We perform a number of tests using spectroscopic data from SDSS-III/BOSS to determine the redshift reliability of our target selection and its ability to meet the science requirements of eBOSS. The SDSS spectra are of high enough signal-to-noise ratio that at least 89% of the target sample yields secure redshift measurements. We also present tests of the uniformity and homogeneity of the sample, demonstrating that it should be clean enough for studies of the large-scale structure of the universe at higher redshifts than SDSS-III/BOSS LRGs reached.},

  abstract      = {Understanding how bulges grow in galaxies is critical step towards unveiling the link between galaxy morphology and star-formation. To do so, it is necessary to decompose large sample of galaxies at different epochs into their main components (bulges and disks). This is particularly challenging, especially at high redshifts, where galaxies are poorly resolved. This work presents a catalog of bulge-disk decompositions of the surface brightness profiles of \~{}17.600 H-band selected galaxies in the CANDELS fields (F160W$\lt$23, 0$\lt$z$\lt$2) in 4 to 7 filters covering a spectral range of 430-1600nm. This is the largest available catalog of this kind up to z = 2. By using a novel approach based on deep-learning to select the best model to fit, we manage to control systematics arising from wrong model selection and obtain less contaminated samples than previous works. We show that the derived structural properties are within $\sim10-20\\%$ of random uncertainties. We then fit stellar population models to the decomposed SEDs (Spectral Energy Distribution) of bulges and disks and derive stellar masses (and stellar mass bulge-to-total ratios) as well as rest-frame colors (U,V,J) for bulges and disks separately. All data products are publicly released with this paper and through the web page https://lerma.obspm.fr/huertas/form\_CANDELS and will be used for scientific analysis in forthcoming works.},

  abstract      = {We present a catalog of visual like H-band morphologies of $\sim50.000$ galaxies ($H\_{f160w}\lt24.5$) in the 5 CANDELS fields (GOODS-N, GOODS-S, UDS, EGS and COSMOS). Morphologies are estimated with Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). The median redshift of the sample is $\ltz\gt\sim1.25$. The algorithm is trained on GOODS-S for which visual classifications are publicly available and then applied to the other 4 fields. Following the CANDELS main morphology classification scheme, our model retrieves the probabilities for each galaxy of having a spheroid, a disk, presenting an irregularity, being compact or point source and being unclassifiable. ConvNets are able to predict the fractions of votes given a galaxy image with zero bias and $\sim10\\%$ scatter. The fraction of miss-classifications is less than $1\\%$. Our classification scheme represents a major improvement with respect to CAS (Concentration-Asymmetry-Smoothness)-based methods, which hit a $20-30\\%$ contamination limit at high z. The catalog is released with the present paper via the $\href{http://rainbowx.fis.ucm.es/Rainbow\_navigator\_public}{Rainbow\,database}$},

The WFC3/G141 grism spectra cover a wavelength range of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/149/6/178/aj511280ieqn1.gif] {$1.1\leqslant \lambda \leqslant 1.7$} μ m with a resolving power of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/149/6/178/aj511280ieqn2.gif] {$R\sim 130$} for point sources, thus providing rest-frame optical spectra for galaxies out to ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/149/6/178/aj511280ieqn3.gif] {$z\sim 3.5$} .

The resulting spectra are visually inspected to identify emission lines, and redshifts are determined using cross-correlation with empirical spectral templates. To establish the accuracy of our redshifts, we compare our results against high-quality spectroscopic redshifts from the literature. Using a sample of 411 control galaxies, this analysis yields a precision of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/149/6/178/aj511280ieqn6.gif] {${{\sigma }_{{\rm NMAD}}}=0.0028$} for the grism-derived redshifts, which is consistent with the accuracy reported by the 3D- HST team. Our final catalog covers an area of 153 arcmin 2 and contains 1019 redshifts for galaxies in GOODS-S. Roughly 60% (608/1019) of these redshifts are for galaxies with no previously published spectroscopic redshift. These new redshifts span a range of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/149/6/178/aj511280ieqn7.gif] {$0.677\leqslant z\leqslant 3.456$} and have a median redshift of z = 1.282.

When combined with previous $\backslash$chandra$\backslash$ observations of a wider area of the strip, AEGIS-X Wide (AEGIS-XW; Laird et\~{}al. 2009), these provide data to a nominal exposure depth of 800ks in the three central ACIS-I fields, a region of approximately $0.29$\~{}deg$^{2}$. This is currently the third deepest X-ray survey in existence, a factor $\sim 2-3$ shallower than the Chandra Deep Fields (CDFs) but over an area $\sim 3$ times greater than each CDF. We present a catalogue of 937 point sources detected in the deep $\backslash$chandra$\backslash$ observations. We present identifications of our X-ray sources from deep ground-based, Spitzer, GALEX and HST imaging. Using a likelihood ratio analysis, we associate multi band counterparts for 929/937 of our X-ray sources, with an estimated 95\~{}$\backslash$\% reliability, making the identification completeness approximately 94\~{}$\backslash$\% in a statistical sense. Reliable spectroscopic redshifts for 353 of our X-ray sources are provided predominantly from Keck (DEEP2/3) and MMT Hectospec, so the current spectroscopic completeness is $\sim 38$\~{}per cent. For the remainder of the X-ray sources, we compute photometric redshifts based on multi-band photometry in up to 35 bands from the UV to mid-IR. Particular attention is given to the fact that the vast majority the X-ray sources are AGN and require hybrid templates. Our photometric redshifts have mean accuracy of $\sigma=0.04$ and an outlier fraction of approximately 5$\backslash$\%, reaching $\sigma=0.03$ with less than 4$\backslash$\% outliers in the area covered by CANDELS . The X-ray, multi-wavelength photometry and redshift catalogues are made publicly available.},

The catalog is based on source detection in the WFC3 F160W band. The F160W mosaic includes the data from CANDELS deep and wide observations as well as previous ERS and HUDF09 programs. The mosaic reaches a 5σ limiting depth (within an aperture of radius 0.''17) of 27.4, 28.2, and 29.7 AB for CANDELS wide, deep, and HUDF regions, respectively. The catalog contains 34,930 sources with the representative 50% completeness reaching 25.9, 26.6, and 28.1 AB in the F160W band for the three regions. In addition to WFC3 bands, the catalog also includes data from UV ( U band from both CTIO/MOSAIC and VLT/VIMOS), optical ( HST /ACS F435W, F606W, F775W, F814W, and F850LP), and infrared ( HST /WFC3 F098M, VLT/ISAAC Ks , VLT/HAWK-I Ks , and Spitzer /IRAC 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0 μm) observations. The catalog is validated via stellar colors, comparison with other published catalogs, zero-point offsets determined from the best-fit templates of the spectral energy distribution of spectroscopically observed objects, and the accuracy of photometric redshifts. The catalog is able to detect unreddened star-forming (passive) galaxies with stellar mass of 10 10 M ☉ at a 50% completeness level to z ~ 3.4 (2.8), 4.6 (3.2), and 7.0 (4.2) in the three regions. As an example of application, the catalog is used to select both star-forming and passive galaxies at z ~ 2-4 via the Balmer break. It is also used to study the color-magnitude diagram of galaxies at 0 < z < 4.},

This survey is designed to document the evolution of galaxies and black holes at z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 1.5-8, and to study Type Ia supernovae at z > 1.5. Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected, each with extensive multi-wavelength observations. The primary CANDELS data consist of imaging obtained in the Wide Field Camera 3 infrared channel (WFC3/IR) and the WFC3 ultraviolet/optical channel, along with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The CANDELS/Deep survey covers ~125 arcmin 2 within GOODS-N and GOODS-S, while the remainder consists of the CANDELS/Wide survey, achieving a total of ~800 arcmin 2 across GOODS and three additional fields (Extended Groth Strip, COSMOS, and Ultra-Deep Survey). We summarize the observational aspects of the survey as motivated by the scientific goals and present a detailed description of the data reduction procedures and products from the survey. Our data reduction methods utilize the most up-to-date calibration files and image combination procedures. We have paid special attention to correcting a range of instrumental effects, including charge transfer efficiency degradation for ACS, removal of electronic bias-striping present in ACS data after Servicing Mission 4, and persistence effects and other artifacts in WFC3/IR. For each field, we release mosaics for individual epochs and eventual mosaics containing data from all epochs combined, to facilitate photometric variability studies and the deepest possible photometry. A more detailed overview of the science goals and observational design of the survey are presented in a companion paper.},

  abstract      = {Studying giant star-forming clumps in distant galaxies is important to understand galaxy formation and evolution. At present, however, observers and theorists have not reached a consensus on whether the observed ``clumps'' in distant galaxies are the same phenomenon that is seen in simulations. In this paper, as a step to establish a benchmark of direct comparisons between observations and theories, we publish a sample of clumps constructed to represent the commonly observed ``clumps'' in the literature. This sample contains 3193 clumps detected from 1270 galaxies at $0.5 \leq z \lt 3.0$. The clumps are detected from rest-frame UV images, as described in our previous paper. Their physical properties, e.g., rest-frame color, stellar mass (M*), star formation rate (SFR), age, and dust extinction, are measured by fitting the spectral energy distribution (SED) to synthetic stellar population models. We carefully test the procedures of measuring clump properties, especially the method of subtracting background fluxes from the diffuse component of galaxies. With our fiducial background subtraction, we find a radial clump U-V color variation, where clumps close to galactic centers are redder than those in outskirts. The slope of the color gradient (clump color as a function of their galactocentric distance scaled by the semi-major axis of galaxies) changes with redshift and M* of the host galaxies: at a fixed M*, the slope becomes steeper toward low redshift, and at a fixed redshift, it becomes slightly steeper with M*. Based on our SED-fitting, this observed color gradient can be explained by a combination of a negative age gradient, a negative E(B-V) gradient, and a positive specific star formation rate gradient of the clumps. We also find that the color gradients of clumps are steeper than those of intra-clump regions. [Abridged]},

  abstract      = {While major mergers have long been proposed as a driver of both AGN activity and the M-sigma relation, studies of moderate to high redshift Seyfert-luminosity AGN hosts have found little evidence for enhanced rates of interactions. However, both theory and observation suggest that while these AGN may be fueled by stochastic accretion and secular processes, high-luminosity, high-redshift, and heavily obscured AGN are the AGN most likely to be merger-driven. To better sample this population of AGN, we turn to infrared selection in the CANDELS/COSMOS field. Compared to their lower-luminosity and less obscured X-ray-only counterparts, IR-only AGN (luminous, heavily obscured AGN) are more likely to be classified as either irregular (50$^{+12}\_{-12}$\% vs. 9$^{+5}\_{-2}$\%) or asymmetric (69$^{+9}\_{-13}$\% vs. 17$^{+6}\_{-4}$\%) and are less likely to have a spheroidal component (31$^{+13}\_{-9}$\% vs. 77$^{+4}\_{-6}$\%). Furthermore, IR-only AGN are also significantly more likely than X-ray-only AGN (75$^{+8}\_{-13}$\% vs. 31$^{+6}\_{-6}$\%) to be classified either as interacting or merging in a way that significantly disturbs the host galaxy or disturbed though not clearly interacting or merging, which potentially represents the late stages of a major merger. This suggests that while major mergers may not contribute significantly to the fueling of Seyfert luminosity AGN, interactions appear to play a more dominant role in the triggering and fueling of high-luminosity heavily obscured AGN.},

  abstract      = {We present quantified visual morphologies of approximately 48,000 galaxies observed in three Hubble Space Telescope legacy fields by the Cosmic And Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) and classified by participants in the Galaxy Zoo project. 90\% of galaxies have z $\lt$ 3 and are observed in rest-frame optical wavelengths by CANDELS. Each galaxy received an average of 40 independent classifications, which we combine into detailed morphological information on galaxy features such as clumpiness, bar instabilities, spiral structure, and merger and tidal signatures. We apply a consensus-based classifier weighting method that preserves classifier independence while effectively down-weighting significantly outlying classifications. After analysing the effect of varying image depth on reported classifications, we also provide depth-corrected classifications which both preserve the information in the deepest observations and also enable the use of classifications at comparable depths across the full survey. Comparing the Galaxy Zoo classifications to previous classifications of the same galaxies shows very good agreement; for some applications the high number of independent classifications provided by Galaxy Zoo provides an advantage in selecting galaxies with a particular morphological profile, while in others the combination of Galaxy Zoo with other classifications is a more promising approach than using any one method alone. We combine the Galaxy Zoo classifications of ``smooth'' galaxies with parametric morphologies to select a sample of featureless disks at 1 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3, which may represent a dynamically warmer progenitor population to the settled disk galaxies seen at later epochs.},

  abstract      = {We present a 69 arcmin$^2$ ALMA survey at 1.1mm, GOODS-ALMA, matching the deepest HST-WFC3 H-band part of the GOODS-South field. We taper the 0``24 original image with a homogeneous and circular synthesized beam of 0''60 to reduce the number of independent beams - thus reducing the number of purely statistical spurious detections - and optimize the sensitivity to point sources. We extract a catalogue of galaxies purely selected by ALMA and identify sources with and without HST counterparts. ALMA detects 20 sources brighter than 0.7 mJy at 1.1mm in the 0``60 tapered mosaic (rms sensitivity $\sigma \simeq$ 0.18 mJy/beam) with a purity greater than 80\%. Among these detections, we identify three sources with no HST nor Spitzer-IRAC counterpart, consistent with the expected number of spurious galaxies from the analysis of the inverted image; their definitive status will require additional investigation. An additional three sources with HST counterparts are detected either at high significance in the higher resolution map, or with different detection-algorithm parameters ensuring a purity greater than 80\%. Hence we identify in total 20 robust detections. Our wide contiguous survey allows us to push further in redshift the blind detection of massive galaxies with ALMA with a median redshift of $\bar{z}$ = 2.92 and a median stellar mass of $\overline{M\_{\star}}$ = 1.1 $\times 10^{11}$M$\_\odot$. Our sample includes 20\% HST-dark galaxies (4 out of 20), all detected in the mid-infrared with Spitzer-IRAC. The near-infrared based photometric redshifts of two of them ($z \sim$4.3 and 4.8) suggest that these sources have redshifts $z \gt$ 4. At least 40\% of the ALMA sources host an X-ray AGN, compared to $\sim$14\% for other galaxies of similar mass and redshift. The wide area of our ALMA survey provides lower values at the bright end of number counts than single-dish telescopes affected by confusion.},

  abstract      = {The rate of major galaxy-galaxy merging is theoretically predicted to steadily increase with redshift during the peak epoch of massive galaxy development ($1{\leq}z{\leq}3$). We use close-pair statistics to objectively study the incidence of massive galaxies (stellar $M\_{1}{\geq}2{\times}10^{10}M\_{\odot}$) hosting major companions ($1{\leq}M\_{1}/M\_{2}{\leq}4$; i.e., $\lt$4:1) at six epochs spanning $0{\lt}z{\lt}3$. We select companions from a nearly complete, mass-limited ($\geq5{\times}10^{9}M\_{\odot}$) sample of 23,696 galaxies in the five CANDELS fields and the SDSS. Using $5-50$ kpc projected separation and close redshift proximity criteria, we find that the major companion fraction $f\_{\mathrm{mc}}(z)$ based on stellar mass-ratio (MR) selection increases from 6\% ($z{\sim}0$) to 16\% ($z{\sim}0.8$), then turns over at $z{\sim}1$ and decreases to 7\% ($z{\sim}3$). Instead, if we use a major F160W flux ratio (FR) selection, we find that $f\_{\mathrm{mc}}(z)$ increases steadily until $z=3$ owing to increasing contamination from minor (MR$\gt$4:1) companions at $z\gt1$. We show that these evolutionary trends are statistically robust to changes in companion proximity. We find disagreements between published results are resolved when selection criteria are closely matched. If we compute merger rates using constant fraction-to-rate conversion factors ($C\_{\mathrm{merg,pair}}{=}0.6$ and $T\_{\mathrm{obs,pair}}{=}0.65\mathrm{Gyr}$), we find that MR rates disagree with theoretical predictions at $z{\gt}1.5$. Instead, if we use an evolving $T\_{\mathrm{obs,pair}}(z){\propto}(1+z)^{-2}$ from Snyder et al., our MR-based rates agree with theory at $0{\lt}z{\lt}3$. Our analysis underscores the need for detailed calibration of $C\_{\mathrm{merg,pair}}$ and $T\_{\mathrm{obs,pair}}$ as a function of redshift, mass and companion selection criteria to better constrain the empirical major merger history.},

  abstract      = {[abridged] We quantify the evolution of the stellar mass functions of star-forming and quiescent galaxies as a function of morphology from $z\sim 3$ to the present. Our sample consists of \~{}50,000 galaxies in the CANDELS fields ($\sim880$ $arcmin^2$), which we divide into four main morphological types, i.e. pure bulge dominated systems, pure spiral disk dominated, intermediate 2-component bulge+disk systems and irregular disturbed galaxies. Our main results are: Star-formation: At $z\sim 2$, 80$\backslash$\% of the stellar mass density of star-forming galaxies is in irregular systems. However, by $z\sim 0.5$, irregular objects only dominate at stellar masses below $10^9M\odot$. A majority of the star-forming irregulars present at $z\sim 2$ undergo a gradual transformation from disturbed to normal spiral disk morphologies by $z\sim 1$ without significant interruption to their star-formation. Rejuvenation after a quenching event does not seem to be common except perhaps for the most massive objects. Quenching: We confirm that galaxies reaching a stellar mass of $M\_*\sim10^{10.8}M\_\odot$ ($M^*$) tend to quench. Also, quenching implies the presence of a bulge: the abundance of massive red disks is negligible at all redshifts over 2\~{}dex in stellar mass. However the dominant quenching mechanism evolves. At $z\gt2$, the SMF of quiescent galaxies above $M^*$ is dominated by compact spheroids. Quenching at this early epoch destroys the disk and produces a compact remnant unless the star-forming progenitors at even higher redshifts are significantly more dense. At $1\ltz\lt2$, the majority of newly quenched galaxies are disks with a significant central bulge. This suggests that mass-quenching at this epoch starts from the inner parts and preserves the disk. At $z\lt1$, the high mass end of the passive SMF is globally in place and the evolution mostly happens at stellar masses below $10^{10}M\_\odot$.},

  abstract = {We present the public release of the stellar mass catalogs for the GOODS-S and UDS fields obtained using some of the deepest near-IR images available, achieved as part of the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey project. We combine the effort from 10 different teams, who computed the stellar masses using the same photometry and the same redshifts. Each team adopted their preferred fitting code, assumptions, priors, and parameter grid. The combination of results using the same underlying stellar isochrones reduces the systematics associated with the fitting code and other choices. Thanks to the availability of different estimates, we can test the effect of some specific parameters and assumptions on the stellar mass estimate. The choice of the stellar isochrone library turns out to have the largest effect on the galaxy stellar mass estimates, resulting in the largest distributions around the median value (with a semi interquartile range larger than 0.1 dex). On the other hand, for most galaxies, the stellar mass estimates are relatively insensitive to the different parameterizations of the star formation history. The inclusion of nebular emission in the model spectra does not have a significant impact for the majority of galaxies (less than a factor of 2 for ~80% of the sample). Nevertheless, the stellar mass for the subsample of young galaxies (age <100 Myr), especially in particular redshift ranges (e.g., 2.2 < z < 2.4, 3.2 < z < 3.6, and 5.5 < z < 6.5), can be seriously overestimated (by up to a factor of 10 for <20 Myr sources) if nebular contribution is ignored.},

The parameters of the best-fitting Sérsic models (total magnitude, half-light radius, Sérsic index, axis ratio, and position angle) are made public, along with newly constructed point-spread functions for each field and filter. Random uncertainties in the measured parameters are estimated for each individual object based on a comparison between multiple, independent measurements of the same set of objects. To quantify systematic uncertainties, we create a mosaic with simulated galaxy images with a realistic distribution of input parameters and then process and analyze the mosaic in an identical manner as the real data. We find that accurate and precise measurements—to 10% or better—of all structural parameters can typically be obtained for galaxies with H F160W < 23, with comparable fidelity for basic size and shape measurements for galaxies to H F160W ~ 24.5.},

The catalog contains 6617 objects with high-quality spectra (two or more spectral features), and 1798 objects with a single spectroscopic feature confirmed by the photometric redshift. For 2024 typically faint objects we could not obtain reliable redshifts. The objects have been selected from a variety of input catalogs based on multi-wavelength observations in the field, and thus have a diverse selection function, which enables the study of the diversity in the galaxy population. The magnitude distribution of our objects is peaked at I\_AB\~{}23 and K\_AB\~{}21, with a secondary peak at K\_AB\~{}24. We sample a broad redshift distribution in the range 0$\lt$z$\lt$6, with one peak at z\~{}1, and another one around z\~{}4. We have identified 13 redshift spikes at z$\gt$0.65 with chance probabilities $\lt$4xE-4$, some of which are clearly related to protocluster structures of sizes \gt10 Mpc. An object-to-object comparison with a multitude of other spectroscopic samples in the same field shows that our DEIMOS sample is among the best in terms of fraction of spectroscopic failures and relative redshift accuracy. We have determined the fraction of spectroscopic blends to about 0.8\% in our sample. This is likely a lower limit and at any rate well below the most pessimistic expectations. Interestingly, we find evidence for strong lensing of Ly-alpha background emitters within the slits of 12 of our target galaxies, increasing their apparent density by about a factor of 4.},

  abstract      = {The galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) at high-z provides key information on star-formation history and mass assembly in the young Universe. We aimed to use the unique combination of deep optical/NIR/MIR imaging provided by HST, Spitzer and the VLT in the CANDELS-UDS, GOODS-South, and HUDF fields to determine the GSMF over the redshift range 3.5$\lt$z$\lt$7.5. We utilised the HST WFC3/IR NIR imaging from CANDELS and HUDF09, reaching H\~{}27-28.5 over a total area of 369 arcmin2, in combination with associated deep HST ACS optical data, deep Spitzer IRAC imaging from the SEDS programme, and deep Y and K-band VLT Hawk-I images from the HUGS programme, to select a galaxy sample with high-quality photometric redshifts. These have been calibrated with more than 150 spectroscopic redshifts in the range 3.5$\lt$z$\lt$7.5, resulting in an overall precision of sigma\_z/(1+z)\~{}0.037. We have determined the low-mass end of the high-z GSMF with unprecedented precision, reaching down to masses as low as M*\~{}10\^{}9 Msun at z=4 and \~{}6x10\^{}9 Msun at z=7. We find that the GSMF at 3.5$\lt$z$\lt$7.5 depends only slightly on the recipes adopted to measure the stellar masses, namely the photo-z, the SFHs, the nebular contribution or the presence of AGN on the parent sample. The low-mass end of the GSMF is steeper than has been found at lower redshifts, but appears to be unchanged over the redshift range probed here. Our results are very different from previous GSMF estimates based on converting UV galaxy luminosity functions into mass functions via tight M/L relations. Integrating our evolving GSMF over mass, we find that the growth of stellar mass density is barely consistent with the time-integral of the SFR density over cosmic time at z$\gt$4. These results confirm the unique synergy of the CANDELS+HUDF, HUGS, and SEDS surveys for the discovery and study of moderate/low-mass galaxies at high redshifts.},

The survey covers roughly 320 arcmin 2 in the ACS F435W, F606W, F814W, and F850LP bands, divided into two well-studied fields. Existing deep observations from the Chandra X-Ray Observatory and ground-based facilities are supplemented with new, deep imaging in the optical and near-infrared from the European Southern Observatory and from the Kitt Peak National Observatory. Deep observations with the Space Infrared Telescope Facility are scheduled. Reduced data from all facilities are being released worldwide within 3-6 months of acquisition. Together, this data set provides two deep reference fields for studies of distant normal and active galaxies, supernovae, and faint stars in our own Galaxy. This Letter serves to outline the survey strategy and describe the specific data that have been used in the accompanying letters, summarizing the reduction procedures and sensitivity limits.},

  abstract      = {We present the results of a new, ultra-deep, near-infrared imaging survey executed with the Hawk-I imager at the ESO VLT, of which we make all the data public. This survey, named HUGS (Hawk-I UDS and GOODS Survey), provides deep, high-quality imaging in the K and Y bands over the CANDELS UDS and GOODS-South fields. We describe here the survey strategy, the data reduction process, and the data quality. HUGS delivers the deepest and highest quality K-band images ever collected over areas of cosmological interest, and ideally complements the CANDELS data set in terms of image quality and depth. The seeing is exceptional and homogeneous, confined to the range 0.38``-0.43''. In the deepest region of the GOODS-S field, (which includes most of the HUDF) the K-band exposure time exceeds 80 hours of integration, yielding a 1-sigma magnitude limit of \~{}28.0 mag/sqarcsec. In the UDS field the survey matches the shallower depth of the CANDELS images reaching a 1-sigma limit per sq.arcsec of \~{}27.3mag in the K band and \~{}28.3mag in the Y-band, We show that the HUGS observations are well matched to the depth of the CANDELS WFC3/IR data, since the majority of even the faintest galaxies detected in the CANDELS H-band images are also detected in HUGS. We present the K-band galaxy number counts produced by combining the HUGS data from the two fields. We show that the slope of the number counts depends sensitively on the assumed distribution of galaxy sizes, with potential impact on the estimated extra-galactic background light (abridged).},

  abstract = {We have measured the radial profiles of isophotal ellipticity ( ε ) and disky/boxy parameter A 4 out to radii of about three times the semimajor axes for ∼4600 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) between redshift 0.5 and 1.8 in the CANDELS/GOODS-S and UDS fields. Based on the average size–mass relation in each redshift bin, we divide our galaxies at a given mass into Small SFGs (SSFGs; smaller than the average) and Large SFGs (LSFGs; larger than the average). We show that, at low masses ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/854/1/70/apjaaa5adieqn1.gif] {${M}_{* }\lt {10}^{10}{M}_{\odot }$} ), the SSFGs generally have nearly flat ε and A 4 profiles in both edge-on and face-on views, especially at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/854/1/70/apjaaa5adieqn2.gif] {$z\gt 1$} . Moreover, the median A 4 values at all radii are almost zero. In contrast, the highly inclined low-mass LSFGs in the same mass-redshift bins generally have monotonically increasing ε profiles with radius and disky feature dominated in the intermediate regions. These findings imply that at these redshifts, the low-mass SSFGs are not disk-like, whereas the low-mass LSFGs likely harbour disk-like components flattened by significant rotations. At high masses ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/854/1/70/apjaaa5adieqn3.gif] {${M}_{* }\gt {10}^{10}{M}_{\odot }$} ), both highly inclined SSFGs and LSFGs generally exhibit distinct trends in both ε and A 4 profiles, which increase at lower radii, reach maxima, then decrease at larger radii. Such the feature is more prevalent for more massive ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/854/1/70/apjaaa5adieqn4.gif] {${M}_{* }\gt {10}^{10.5}{M}_{\odot }$} ) galaxies or at lower redshifts ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/854/1/70/apjaaa5adieqn5.gif] {$z\lt 1.4$} ). This feature can be simply explained if galaxies possess all three components: central bulges, disks in the intermediate regions, and halo-like stellar components in the outskirts.},

  abstract      = {The reionization of the Universe is one of the most important topics of present day astrophysical research. The most plausible candidates for the reionization process are star-forming galaxies, which according to the predictions of the majority of the theoretical and semi-analytical models should dominate the HI ionizing background at z\~{}3. We aim at measuring the Lyman continuum escape fraction, which is one of the key parameters to compute the contribution of star-forming galaxies to the UV background. We have used ultra-deep U-band imaging (U=30.2mag at 1sigma) by LBC/LBT in the CANDELS/GOODS-North field, as well as deep imaging in COSMOS and EGS fields, in order to estimate the Lyman continuum escape fraction of 69 star-forming galaxies with secure spectroscopic redshifts at 3.27$\lt$z$\lt$3.40 to faint magnitude limits (L=0.2L*, or equivalently M1500\~{}-19). We have measured through stacks a stringent upper limit ($\lt$1.7\% at 1sigma) for the relative escape fraction of HI ionizing photons from bright galaxies (L$\gt$L*), while for the faint population (L=0.2L*) the limit to the escape fraction is \~{}10\%. We have computed the contribution of star-forming galaxies to the observed UV background at z\~{}3 and we have found that it is not enough to keep the Universe ionized at these redshifts, unless their escape fraction increases significantly ($\gt$10\%) at low luminosities (M1500$\gt$-19). We compare our results on the Lyman continuum escape fraction of high-z galaxies with recent estimates in the literature and discuss future prospects to shed light on the end of the Dark Ages. In the future, strong gravitational lensing will be fundamental to measure the Lyman continuum escape fraction down to faint magnitudes (M1500\~{}-16) which are inaccessible with the present instrumentation on blank fields.},

  abstract      = {We use data from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey to study how the spatial variation in the stellar populations of galaxies relate to the formation of galaxies at $1.5 \lt z \lt 3.5$. We use the Internal Color Dispersion (ICD), measured between the rest-frame UV and optical bands, which is sensitive to age (and dust attenuation) variations in stellar populations. The ICD shows a relation with the stellar masses and morphologies of the galaxies. Galaxies with the largest variation in their stellar populations as evidenced by high ICD have disk-dominated morphologies (with S$\backslash$'$\{$e$\}$rsic indexes $\lt 2$) and stellar masses between $10 \lt \mathrm{Log~M/ M\_\odot}\lt 11$. There is a marked decrease in the ICD as the stellar mass and/or the S$\backslash$'ersic index increases. By studying the relations between the ICD and other galaxy properties including sizes, total colors, star-formation rate, and dust attenuation, we conclude that the largest variations in stellar populations occur in galaxies where the light from newly, high star-forming clumps contrasts older stellar disk populations. This phase reaches a peak for galaxies only with a specific stellar mass range, $10 \lt \mathrm{Log~M/ M\_\odot} \lt 11$, and prior to the formation of a substantial bulge/spheroid. In contrast, galaxies at higher or lower stellar masses, and/or higher S$\backslash$'$\{$e$\}$rsic index ($n \gt 2$) show reduced ICD values, implying a greater homogeneity of their stellar populations. This indicates that if a galaxy is to have both a quiescent bulge along with a star forming disk, typical of Hubble Sequence galaxies, this is most common for stellar masses $10 \lt \mathrm{Log~M/M\_\odot} \lt 11$ and when the bulge component remains relatively small ($n\lt2$).},

We present a detailed measurement of MOSFIRE's sensitivity as a function of wavelength, including the effects of telluric features across the YJHK filters. The largest utility of our survey is in providing rest-frame-optical emission lines for z$\gt$1 galaxies, and we demonstrate that the ratios of strong, optical emission lines of z\~{}2 galaxies suggest the presence of either higher N/O abundances than are found in z\~{}0 galaxies or low-metallicity gas ionized by an active galactic nucleus.

UKIDSS is being carried out using the UKIRT Wide Field Camera (WFCAM), which has the largest {\'e}tendue of any infrared astronomical instrument to date. It is a portfolio of five survey components covering various combinations of the filter set ZYJHK and H$_{2}$. The Large Area Survey, the Galactic Clusters Survey, and the Galactic Plane Survey cover approximately 7000deg$^{2}$ to a depth of K \~{} 18; the Deep Extragalactic Survey covers 35deg$^{2}$ to K \~{} 21, and the Ultra Deep Survey covers 0.77deg$^{2}$ to K \~{} 23. Summed together UKIDSS is 12 times larger in effective volume than the 2MASS survey. The prime aim of UKIDSS is to provide a long-term astronomical legacy data base; the design is, however, driven by a series of specific goals - for example, to find the nearest and faintest substellar objects, to discover Population II brown dwarfs, if they exist, to determine the substellar mass function, to break the z = 7 quasar barrier; to determine the epoch of re-ionization, to measure the growth of structure from z = 3 to the present day, to determine the epoch of spheroid formation, and to map the Milky Way through the dust, to several kpc. The survey data are being uniformly processed. Images and catalogues are being made available through a fully queryable user interface - the WFCAM Science Archive (http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/wsa). The data are being released in stages. The data are immediately public to astronomers in all ESO member states, and available to the world after 18 months. Before the formal survey began, UKIRT and the UKIDSS consortia collaborated in obtaining and analysing a series of small science verification (SV) projects to complete the commissioning of the camera. We show some results from these SV projects in order to demonstrate the likely power of the eventual complete survey. Finally, using the data from the First Data Release, we assess how well UKIDSS is meeting its design targets so far.},

  abstract = {Galaxies with stellar masses near M * contain the majority of stellar mass in the universe, and are therefore of special interest in the study of galaxy evolution. The Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) have present-day stellar masses near M *, at 5 × 10 10 M ☉ (defined here to be MW-mass) and 10 11 M ☉ (defined to be M31-mass). We study the typical progenitors of these galaxies using the FOURSTAR Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE). ZFOURGE is a deep medium-band near-IR imaging survey, which is sensitive to the progenitors of these galaxies out to z ~ 3. We use abundance-matching techniques to identify the main progenitors of these galaxies at higher redshifts. We measure the evolution in the stellar mass, rest-frame colors, morphologies, far-IR luminosities, and star formation rates, combining our deep multiwavelength imaging with near-IR Hubble Space Telescope imaging from Cosmic Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS), and Spitzer and Herschel far-IR imaging from Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-Herschel and CANDELS-Herschel. The typical MW-mass and M31-mass progenitors passed through the same evolution stages, evolving from blue, star-forming disk galaxies at the earliest stages to redder dust-obscured IR-luminous galaxies in intermediate stages and to red, more quiescent galaxies at their latest stages. The progenitors of the MW-mass galaxies reached each evolutionary stage at later times (lower redshifts) and with stellar masses that are a factor of two to three lower than the progenitors of the M31-mass galaxies. The process driving this evolution, including the suppression of star formation in present-day M * galaxies, requires an evolving stellar-mass/halo-mass ratio and/or evolving halo-mass threshold for quiescent galaxies. The effective size and SFRs imply that the baryonic cold-gas fractions drop as galaxies evolve from high redshift to z ~ 0 and are strongly anticorrelated with an increase in the Sérsic index. Therefore, the growth of galaxy bulges in M * galaxies corresponds to a rapid decline in the galaxy gas fractions and/or a decrease in the star formation efficiency.},

  abstract = {The Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) is designed to document the first third of galactic evolution, over the approximate redshift ( z ) range 8-1.5. It will image >250,000 distant galaxies using three separate cameras on the Hubble Space Telescope , from the mid-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, and will find and measure Type Ia supernovae at z > 1.5 to test their accuracy as standardizable candles for cosmology. Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected, each with extensive ancillary data. The use of five widely separated fields mitigates cosmic variance and yields statistically robust and complete samples of galaxies down to a stellar mass of 10 9 M ☉ to z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 2, reaching the knee of the ultraviolet luminosity function of galaxies to z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 8. The survey covers approximately 800 arcmin 2 and is divided into two parts. The CANDELS/Deep survey (5σ point-source limit H = 27.7 mag) covers ~125 arcmin 2 within Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS)-N and GOODS-S. The CANDELS/Wide survey includes GOODS and three additional fields (Extended Groth Strip, COSMOS, and Ultra-deep Survey) and covers the full area to a 5σ point-source limit of H ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 27.0 mag. Together with the Hubble Ultra Deep Fields, the strategy creates a three-tiered "wedding-cake" approach that has proven efficient for extragalactic surveys. Data from the survey are nonproprietary and are useful for a wide variety of science investigations. In this paper, we describe the basic motivations for the survey, the CANDELS team science goals and the resulting observational requirements, the field selection and geometry, and the observing design. The Hubble data processing and products are described in a companion paper.},

  abstract      = {We present the results of a new study of dust attenuation at redshifts 3 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 4 based on a sample of 236 star-forming galaxies from the VANDELS spectroscopic survey. Motivated by results from the First Billion Years (FiBY) simulation project, we argue that the intrinsic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of star-forming galaxies at these redshifts have a self-similar shape across the mass range 8.2 {\le} log (M$_{⋆}$/M$_{⊙}$) {\le} 10.6 probed by our sample. Using FiBY data, we construct a set of intrinsic SED templates which incorporate both detailed star formation and chemical abundance histories, and a variety of stellar population synthesis (SPS) model assumptions. With this set of intrinsic SEDs, we present a novel approach for directly recovering the shape and normalization of the dust attenuation curve. We find, across all of the intrinsic templates considered, that the average attenuation curve for star-forming galaxies at z {\sime} 3.5 is similar in shape to the commonly adopted Calzetti starburst law, with an average total-to-selective attenuation ratio of R$_{V}$ = 4.18 {\plusmn} 0.29. In contrast, we find that an average attenuation curve as steep as the SMC extinction law is strongly disfavoured. We show that the optical attenuation (A$_{V}$) versus stellar mass (M$_{⋆}$) relation predicted using our method is consistent with recent ALMA observations of galaxies at 2 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3 in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), as well as empirical A$_{V}$ - M$_{⋆}$ relations predicted by a Calzetti-like law. In fact, our results, combined with other literature data, suggest that the A$_{V}$-M$_{⋆}$ relation does not evolve over the redshift range 0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 5, at least for galaxies with log(M$_{⋆}$/M$_{⊙}$) {\gsim} 9.5. Finally, we present tentative evidence which suggests that the attenuation curve may become steeper at lower masses log(M$_{⋆}$/M$_{⊙}$) {\lsim} 9.0.},

VANDELS' main targets are star-forming galaxies at 2.4$\lt$z$\lt$5.5 and massive passive galaxies at 1$\lt$z$\lt$2.5. By adopting a strategy of ultra-long exposure times, from 20 to 80 hours per source, VANDELS is designed to be the deepest ever spectroscopic survey of the high-redshift Universe. Exploiting the red sensitivity of the VIMOS spectrograph, the survey has obtained ultra-deep spectra covering the wavelength 4800-10000 A with sufficient signal-to-noise to investigate the astrophysics of high-redshift galaxy evolution via detailed absorption line studies. The VANDELS-DR1 is the release of all spectra obtained during the first season of observations and includes data for galaxies for which the total (or half of the total) scheduled integration time was completed. The release contains 879 individual objects with a measured redshift and includes fully wavelength and flux-calibrated 1D spectra, the associated error spectra, sky spectra and wavelength-calibrated 2D spectra. We also provide a catalog with the essential galaxy parameters, including spectroscopic redshifts and redshift quality flags. In this paper we present the survey layout and observations, the data reduction and redshift measurement procedure and the general properties of the VANDELS-DR1 sample. We also discuss the spectroscopic redshift distribution, the accuracy of the photometric redshifts and we provide some examples of data products. All VANDELS-DR1 data are publicly available and can be retrieved from the ESO archive. Two further data releases are foreseen in the next 2 years with a final release scheduled for June 2020 which will include improved re-reduction of the entire spectroscopic data set. (abridged)},

  abstract = {The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer ( WISE ) satellite observed the full sky in four mid-infrared bands in the 2.8-28 μ m range. The primary mission was completed in 2010. The WISE team has done a superb job of producing a series of high-quality, well-documented, complete data releases in a timely manner. However, the "Atlas Image" coadds that are part of the recent AllWISE and previous data releases were intentionally blurred. Convolving the images by the point-spread function while coadding results in "matched-filtered" images that are close to optimal for detecting isolated point sources. But these matched-filtered images are sub-optimal or inappropriate for other purposes. For example, we are photometering the WISE images at the locations of sources detected in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey through forward modeling, and this blurring decreases the available signal-to-noise by effectively broadening the point-spread function. This paper presents a new set of coadds of the WISE images that have not been blurred. These images retain the intrinsic resolution of the data and are appropriate for photometry preserving the available signal-to-noise. Users should be cautioned, however, that the W 3- and W 4-band coadds contain artifacts around large, bright structures (large galaxies, dusty nebulae, etc.); eliminating these artifacts is the subject of ongoing work. These new coadds, and the code used to produce them, are publicly available at http://unwise.me [http://unwise.me] .},

  abstract = {We present photometry of images from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer ( WISE ) of over 400 million sources detected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We use a “forced photometry” technique, using measured SDSS source positions, star–galaxy classification, and galaxy profiles to define the sources whose fluxes are to be measured in the WISE images. We perform photometry with The Tractor image modeling code, working on our “unWISE” coaddds and taking account of the WISE point-spread function and a noise model. The result is a measurement of the flux of each SDSS source in each WISE band. Many sources have little flux in the WISE bands, so often the measurements we report are consistent with zero given our uncertainties. However, for many sources we get 3 σ or 4 σ measurements; these sources would not be reported by the “official” WISE pipeline and will not appear in the WISE catalog, yet they can be highly informative for some scientific questions. In addition, these small-signal measurements can be used in stacking analyses at the catalog level. The forced photometry approach has the advantage that we measure a consistent set of sources between SDSS and WISE , taking advantage of the resolution and depth of the SDSS images to interpret the WISE images; objects that are resolved in SDSS but blended together in WISE still have accurate measurements in our photometry. Our results, and the code used to produce them, are publicly available at http://unwise.me [http://unwise.me] .},

Our survey has flux limits of $1.7\times10^{-15}$, $1.3\times10^{-14}$, and $6.5\times10^{-15}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ over 90\% of its area in the soft, hard, and full bands, respectively, which is comparable to those of the XMM-COSMOS survey. We identify multiwavelength counterpart candidates for 99.9\% of the X-ray sources, of which 93\% are considered as reliable based on their matching likelihood ratios. The reliabilities of these high-likelihood-ratio counterparts are further confirmed to be $\approx 97$\% reliable based on deep Chandra coverage over $\approx 5$\% of the XMM-LSS region. Results of multiwavelength identifications are also included in the source catalog, along with basic optical-to-infrared photometry and spectroscopic redshifts from publicly available surveys.

  abstract      = {Quasars are often considered to be point-like objects. This is largely true and allows for an excellent alignment of the optical positional reference frame of the ongoing ESA mission Gaia with the International Celestial Reference Frame. But presence of optical jets in quasars can cause shifts of the optical photo-centers at levels detectable by Gaia. Similarly, motion of emitting blobs in the jet can be detected as proper motion shifts. Gaia's measurements of spectral energy distribution for around a million distant quasars is useful to determine their redshifts and to assess their variability on timescales from hours to years. Spatial resolution of Gaia allows to build a complete magnitude limited sample of strongly lensed quasars. The mission had its first public data release in September 2016 and is scheduled to have the next and much more comprehensive one in April 2018. Here we briefly review the capabilities and current results of the mission. Gaia's unique contributions to the studies of quasars are already being published, a highlight being a discovery of a number of quasars with optical jets.},

  title       = {ALMA Deep Field in SSA22: Survey Design and Source Catalog of a 20 arcmin^2 Survey at 1.1mm},
  abstract    = {To search for dust-obscured star-formation activity in the early Universe, it is essential to obtain a deep and wide submillimeter/millimeter map. The advent of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has enabled us to obtain such maps at sufficiently high spatial resolution to be free from source confusion. We present a new 1.1mm map obtained by ALMA in the SSA22 field. SSA22 contains a remarkable proto-cluster at z=3.09 and is therefore an ideal region to investigate the role of large-scale cosmic web on dust-obscured star formation. The typical 1sigma depth of our map is 73 uJy/beam at a 0.5 resolution; combined with earlier, archived observations, we map an area of 20 arcmin^2 (71 comoving Mpc^2 at z=3.09). Within the combined survey area we have detected 35 sources at a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) >5, with flux densities, S1.1mm=0.43--5.6 mJy, equivalent to star-formation rates of >=100--1000 Msun/yr at z=3.09, for a Chabrier initial mass function; of these, 17 are new detections. The cumulative number counts show a factor 3--5x excess compared to blank fields. The excess suggests enhanced dust-enshrouded star-formation activity in the proto-cluster on a 10 comoving Mpc scale, indicating accelerated galaxy evolution in this overdense region.},

  title       = {Gaia Data Release 2: Kinematics of globular clusters and dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way},
  abstract    = {The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the outstanding quality of the second data release of the Gaia mission and its power for constraining many different aspects of the dynamics of the satellites of the Milky Way. We focus here on determining the proper motions of 75 Galactic globular clusters, nine dwarf spheroidal galaxies, one ultra-faint system, and the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Using data extracted from the Gaia archive, we derived the proper motions and parallaxes for these systems, as well as their uncertainties. We demonstrate that the errors, statistical and systematic, are relatively well understood. We integrated the orbits of these objects in three different Galactic potentials, and characterised their properties. We present the derived proper motions, space velocities, and characteristic orbital parameters in various tables to facilitate their use by the astronomical community. Our limited and straightforward analyses have allowed us for example to (i) determine absolute and very precise proper motions for globular clusters; (ii) detect clear rotation signatures in the proper motions of at least five globular clusters; (iii) show that the satellites of the Milky Way are all on high-inclination orbits, but that they do not share a single plane of motion; (iv) derive a lower limit for the mass of the Milky Way of 9.8^{+6.7}_{-2.7} x 10^{11} Msun based on the assumption that the Leo I dwarf spheroidal is bound; (v) derive a rotation curve for the Large Magellanic Cloud based solely on proper motions that is competitive with line-of-sight velocity curves, now using many orders of magnitude more sources; and (vi) unveil the dynamical effect of the bar on the motions of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. All these results highlight the incredible power of the Gaia astrometric mission, and in particular of its second data release.},

  title       = {Gaia Data Release 2: Mapping the Milky Way disc kinematics},
  abstract    = {To illustrate the potential of GDR2, we provide a first look at the kinematics of the Milky Way disc, within a radius of several kiloparsecs around the Sun. We benefit for the first time from a sample of 6.4 million F-G-K stars with full 6D phase-space coordinates, precise parallaxes, and precise Galactic cylindrical velocities . From this sample, we extracted a sub-sample of 3.2 million giant stars to map the velocity field of the Galactic disc from $\sim$5~kpc to $\sim$13~kpc from the Galactic centre and up to 2~kpc above and below the plane. We also study the distribution of 0.3 million solar neighbourhood stars ($r < 200$~pc), with median velocity uncertainties of 0.4~km/s, in velocity space and use the full sample to examine how the over-densities evolve in more distant regions. GDR2 allows us to draw 3D maps of the Galactocentric median velocities and velocity dispersions with unprecedented accuracy, precision, and spatial resolution. The maps show the complexity and richness of the velocity field of the galactic disc. We observe streaming motions in all the components of the velocities as well as patterns in the velocity dispersions. For example, we confirm the previously reported negative and positive galactocentric radial velocity gradients in the inner and outer disc, respectively. Here, we see them as part of a non-axisymmetric kinematic oscillation, and we map its azimuthal and vertical behaviour. We also witness a new global arrangement of stars in the velocity plane of the solar neighbourhood and in distant regions in which stars are organised in thin substructures with the shape of circular arches that are oriented approximately along the horizontal direction in the $U-V$ plane. Moreover, in distant regions, we see variations in the velocity substructures more clearly than ever before, in particular, variations in the velocity of the Hercules stream. (abridged)},

  abstract    = {The second release of Gaia data (Gaia DR2) contains the astrometric parameters for more than half a million quasars. This set defines a kinematically non-rotating reference frame in the optical domain referred to as the Gaia-CRF2. The Gaia-CRF2 is the first realisation of a non-rotating global optical reference frame that meets the ICRS prescriptions, meaning that it is built only on extragalactic sources. It consists of the positions of a sample of 556 869 sources in Gaia DR2, obtained from a positional cross-match with the ICRF3-prototype and AllWISE AGN catalogues. The sample constitutes a clean, dense, and homogeneous set of extragalactic point sources in the magnitude range G from 16 to 21 mag with accurately known optical positions. The median positional uncertainty is 0.12 mas for G < 18 mag and 0.5 mas at G = 20 mag. Large-scale systematics are estimated to be in the range 20 to 30 muas. The accuracy claims are supported by the parallaxes and proper motions of the quasars in Gaia DR2. The optical positions for a subset of 2820 sources in common with the ICRF3-prototype show very good overall agreement with the radio positions, but several tens of sources have significantly discrepant positions.},

  abstract    = {The Gaia Data Release 2 contains the 1st release of radial velocities complementing the kinematic data of a sample of about 7 million relatively bright, late-type stars. Aims: This paper provides a detailed description of the Gaia spectroscopic data processing pipeline, and of the approach adopted to derive the radial velocities presented in DR2. Methods: The pipeline must perform four main tasks: (i) clean and reduce the spectra observed with the Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS); (ii) calibrate the RVS instrument, including wavelength, straylight, line-spread function, bias non-uniformity, and photometric zeropoint; (iii) extract the radial velocities; and (iv) verify the accuracy and precision of the results. The radial velocity of a star is obtained through a fit of the RVS spectrum relative to an appropriate synthetic template spectrum. An additional task of the spectroscopic pipeline was to provide 1st-order estimates of the stellar atmospheric parameters required to select such template spectra. We describe the pipeline features and present the detailed calibration algorithms and software solutions we used to produce the radial velocities published in DR2. Results: The spectroscopic processing pipeline produced median radial velocities for Gaia stars with narrow-band near-IR magnitude Grvs < 12 (i.e. brighter than V~13). Stars identified as double-lined spectroscopic binaries were removed from the pipeline, while variable stars, single-lined, and non-detected double-lined spectroscopic binaries were treated as single stars. The scatter in radial velocity among different observations of a same star, also published in DR2, provides information about radial velocity variability. For the hottest (Teff > 7000 K) and coolest (Teff < 3500 K) stars, the accuracy and precision of the stellar parameter estimates are not sufficient to allow selection of appropriate templates.

The resulting catalogue has seven observations per star on average on a typical time baseline of six years, with a median standard deviation of 15 m/s.

A summary of the contents of Gaia DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results. Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the $G_\mathrm{BP}$ (330--680 nm) and $G_\mathrm{RP}$ (630--1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent.},

  abstract    = {Complex organic molecules are readily detected in the inner regions of the gaseous envelopes of forming protostars. In particular, molecules that contain nitrogen are interesting due to the role nitrogen plays in the development of life and the compact scales such molecules have been found to trace around forming protostars. The goal of this work is to determine the inventory of one family of nitrogen-bearing organic molecules, complex nitriles (molecules with a $-$CN functional group) towards two hot corino sources in the low-mass protostellar binary IRAS 16293$-$2422. This work explores the abundance differences between the two sources, the isotopic ratios, and the spatial extent derived from molecules containing the nitrile functional group. Using data from the Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey (PILS) obtained with ALMA we determine abundances and excitation temperatures for the detected nitriles. We also present a new method for determining the spatial structure of sources with high line density and large velocity gradients $-$ Velocity-corrected INtegrated emission (VINE) maps. We detect methyl cyanide (CH$_3$CN) as well as 5 of its isotopologues, including the detection of CHD$_2$CN which is the first detection in the ISM. We also detect ethyl cyanide (C$_2$H$_5$CN), vinyl cyanide (C$_2$H$_3$CN), and cyanoacetylene (HC$_3$N). We find that abundances are similar between IRAS 16293A and IRAS 16293B on small scales except for vinyl cyanide which is only detected towards the latter source. This suggests an important difference between the sources either in their evolutionary stage or warm-up timescales. We also detect a spatially double-peaked emission for the first time in molecular emission in the A source, suggesting that this source is showing structure related to a rotating toroid of material.},

Gaia is observing about 1.7 billion sources, measuring their position, trigonometric parallax, proper motions and time-series photometry in 3 pass-bands down to a faint magnitude limit of G $\sim$21 mag. Among them are thousands of Cepheids and hundreds of thousands of RR Lyrae stars. After a five years of mission the parallax errors are expected to be of about 10 microarcsec for sources brighter than V $\sim$ 12, 13 mag. This will allow an accurate re-calibration of the fundamental relations that make RR Lyrae stars and Cepheids primary standard candles of the cosmic distance ladder and will provide a fresh view of the systems and structures that host these classical pulsators. Results for Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars published in Gaia Data Release 1 (DR1) are reviewed along with some perspectives on Gaia DR2, scheduled for 25 April 2018, which will contain parallaxes based only on Gaia measurements and a first mapping of full-sky RR Lyrae stars and Cepheids.},

  abstract    = {We highlight the power of the Gaia DR2 in studying many fine structures of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD). Gaia allows us to present many different HRDs, depending in particular on stellar population selections. We do not aim here for completeness in terms of types of stars or stellar evolutionary aspects. Instead, we have chosen several illustrative examples. We describe some of the selections that can be made in Gaia DR2 to highlight the main structures of the Gaia HRDs. We select both field and cluster (open and globular) stars, compare the observations with previous classifications and with stellar evolutionary tracks, and we present variations of the Gaia HRD with age, metallicity, and kinematics. Late stages of stellar evolution such as hot subdwarfs, post-AGB stars, planetary nebulae, and white dwarfs are also analysed, as well as low-mass brown dwarf objects. The Gaia HRDs are unprecedented in both precision and coverage of the various Milky Way stellar populations and stellar evolutionary phases. Many fine structures of the HRDs are presented. The clear split of the white dwarf sequence into hydrogen and helium white dwarfs is presented for the first time in an HRD. The relation between kinematics and the HRD is nicely illustrated. Two different populations in a classical kinematic selection of the halo are unambiguously identified in the HRD. Membership and mean parameters for a selected list of open clusters are provided. They allow drawing very detailed cluster sequences, highlighting fine structures, and providing extremely precise empirical isochrones that will lead to more insight in stellar physics. Gaia DR2 demonstrates the potential of combining precise astrometry and photometry for large samples for studies in stellar evolution and stellar population and opens an entire new area for HRD-based studies.},

  abstract    = {The second Gaia data release (Gaia-DR2) contains, beyond the astrometry, three-band photometry for 1.38 billion sources. We have used these three broad bands to infer stellar effective temperatures, Teff, for all sources brighter than G=17 mag with Teff in the range 3000-10 000 K (161 million sources). Using in addition the parallaxes, we infer the line-of-sight extinction, A_G, and the reddening, E[BP-RP], for 88 million sources. Together with a bolometric correction we derive luminosity and radius for 77 million sources. These quantities as well as their estimated uncertainties are part of Gaia-DR2. Here we describe the procedures by which these quantities were obtained, including the underlying assumptions, comparison with literature estimates, and the limitations of our results. Typical accuracies are of order 324 K (Teff), 0.46 mag (A_G), 0.23 mag (E[BP-RP]), 15% (luminosity), and 10% (radius). Being based on only a small number of observable quantities and limited training data, our results are necessarily subject to some extreme assumptions that can lead to strong systematics in some cases (not included in the aforementioned accuracy estimates). One aspect is the non-negativity contraint of our estimates, in particular extinction. Yet in several regions of parameter space our results show very good performance, for example for red clump stars and solar analogues. Large uncertainties render the extinctions less useful at the individual star level, but they show good performance for ensemble estimates. We identify regimes in which our parameters should and should not be used and we define a "clean" sample. Despite the limitations, this is the largest catalogue of uniformly-inferred stellar parameters to date. More precise and detailed astrophysical parameters based on the full BP/RP spectrophotometry are planned as part of the third Gaia data release.},

  title       = {Estimating distances from parallaxes IV: Distances to 1.33 billion stars in Gaia Data Release 2},
  abstract    = {For the vast majority of stars in the second Gaia data release, reliable distances cannot be obtained by inverting the parallax. A correct inference procedure must instead be used to account for the nonlinearity of the transformation and the asymmetry of the resulting probability distribution. Here we infer distances to essentially all 1.33 billion stars with parallaxes published in the second Gaia data release. This is done using a weak distance prior that varies smoothly as a function of Galactic longitude and latitude according to a Galaxy model. The irreducible uncertainty in the distance estimate is characterized by the lower and upper bounds of an asymmetric confidence interval. Although more precise distances can be estimated for a subset of the stars using additional data (such as photometry), our goal is to provide purely geometric distance estimates, independent of assumptions about the physical properties of, or interstellar extinction towards, individual stars. We analyse the characteristics of the catalogue and validate it using clusters. The catalogue can be queried using ADQL at http://gaia.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/tap.html (which also hosts the Gaia catalogue) as the table geometric_distance in the schema gaiadr2_complements. The catalogue will go live on or before 30 April. Before that you can access it as a set of CSV files from http://www.mpia.de/~calj/gdr2_distances.html.},

The first data release from Gaia (DR1) provides an extremely large and precise stellar catalogue, which when combined with the Tycho-2 catalogue gives the 2.5 million parallaxes and proper motions contained within the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS). Aims. We aim to identify new member candidates of the nearby Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius-Centaurus Complex within the TGAS catalogue. In doing so, we also aim to validate the use of the DBSCAN clustering algorithm on spatial and kinematic data as a robust member selection method. Methods. We constructed a method for member selection using a density-based clustering algorithm (DBSCAN) applied over proper motion and distance. We then applied this method to Upper Scorpius, and evaluated the results and performance of the method. Results. We identified 167 member candidates of Upper Scorpius, of which 78 are new, distributed within a 10$^{\circ}$ radius from its core. These member candidates have a mean distance of 145.6 $\pm$ 7.5 pc, and a mean proper motion of (-11.4, -23.5) $\pm$ (0.7, 0.4) mas/yr. These values are consistent with measured distances and proper motions of previously identified bona-fide members of the Upper Scorpius association.},

  abstract    = {SPHEREx is a proposed NASA MIDEX mission selected for Phase A study. SPHEREx will carry out the first all-sky spectral survey in the near infrared. At the end of its two-year mission, SPHEREx will obtain 0.75-to-5$\mu$m spectra of every 6.2 arcsec pixel on the sky, with spectral resolution R>35 and a 5-$\sigma$ sensitivity AB$>$19 per spectral/spatial resolution element. More details concerning SPHEREx are available at http://spherex.caltech.edu. The SPHEREx team has proposed three specific science investigations to be carried out with this unique data set: cosmic inflation, interstellar and circumstellar ices, and the extra-galactic background light. Though these three themes are undoubtedly compelling, they are far from exhausting the scientific output of SPHEREx. Indeed, SPHEREx will create a unique all-sky spectral database including spectra of very large numbers of astronomical and solar system targets, including both extended and diffuse sources. These spectra will enable a wide variety of investigations, and the SPHEREx team is dedicated to making the data available to the community to enable these investigations, which we refer to as Legacy Science. To that end, we have sponsored two workshops for the general scientific community to identify the most interesting Legacy Science themes and to ensure that the SPHEREx data products are responsive to their needs. In February of 2016, some 50 scientists from all fields met in Pasadena to develop these themes and to understand their implications for the SPHEREx mission. The 2016 workshop highlighted many synergies between SPHEREx and other contemporaneous astronomical missions, facilities, and databases. Consequently, in January 2018 we convened a second workshop at the Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge to focus specifically on these synergies. This white paper reports on the results of the 2018 SPHEREx workshop.},

  title       = {The PAU Survey: A Forward Modeling Approach for Narrow-band Imaging},
  abstract    = {Weak gravitational lensing is a powerful probe of the dark sector, once measurement systematic errors can be controlled. In Refregier & Amara (2014), a calibration method based on forward modeling, called MCCL, was proposed. This relies on fast image simulations (e.g., UFig; Berge et al. 2013) that capture the key features of galaxy populations and measurement effects. The MCCL approach has been used in Herbel et al. (2017) to determine the redshift distribution of cosmological galaxy samples and, in the process, the authors derived a model for the galaxy population mainly based on broad-band photometry. Here, we test this model by forward modeling the 40 narrow-band photometry given by the novel PAU Survey (PAUS). For this purpose, we apply the same forced photometric pipeline on data and simulations using Source Extractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996). The image simulation scheme performance is assessed at the image and at the catalogues level. We find good agreement for the distribution of pixel values, the magnitudes, in the magnitude-size relation and the interband correlations. A principal component analysis is then performed, in order to derive a global comparison of the narrow-band photometry between the data and the simulations. We use a `mixing' matrix to quantify the agreement between the observed and simulated sets of Principal Components (PCs). We find good agreement, especially for the first three most significant PCs. We also compare the coefficients of the PCs decomposition. While there are slight differences for some coefficients, we find that the distributions are in good agreement. Together, our results show that the galaxy population model derived from broad-band photometry is in good overall agreement with the PAUS data. This offers good prospect for incorporating spectral information to the galaxy model by adjusting it to the PAUS narrow-band data using forward modeling.},

  abstract    = {Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are thought to play a critical role in shaping galaxies, but their effect on the circumgalactic medium (CGM) is not well studied. We present results from the COS-AGN survey: 19 quasar sightlines that probe the CGM of 20 optically-selected AGN host galaxies with impact parameters $80 < \rho_{imp} < 300$ kpc. Absorption lines from a variety of species are measured and compared to a stellar mass and impact parameter matched sample of sightlines through non-AGN galaxies. Amongst the observed species in the COS-AGN sample (HI, CII, SiII, SiIII, CIV, SiIV, NV), only Ly$\alpha$ shows a high covering fraction ($94^{+6}_{-23}$% for rest-frame equivalent widths EW $> 124$ m\AA) whilst many of the metal ions are not detected in individual sightlines. A sightline-by-sightline comparison between COS-AGN and the control sample yields no significant difference in EW distribution. However, stacked spectra of the COS-AGN and control samples show significant (> 3 sigma) enhancements in the EW of both SiIII and Ly$\alpha$ at impact parameters $> 164$ kpc by a factor of $+0.45\pm0.05$ dex and $> +0.75$ dex respectively. The lack of detections of both high-ionization species near the AGN and strong kinematic offsets between the absorption systemic galaxy redshifts indicates that neither the AGN's ionization nor its outflows are the origin of these differences. Instead, we suggest the observed differences could result from either AGN hosts residing in haloes with intrinsically distinct gas properties, or that their CGM has been affected by a previous event, such as a starburst, which may also have fuelled the nuclear activity.},

The S2CLS parent sample covers a 0.96 degree$^2$ field at $\sigma_{850}=0.90\pm0.05$ mJy beam$^{-1}$. Our deep, high-resolution ALMA observations with $\sigma_{\rm 870}\sim$ 0.25 mJy and a 0.15"--0.30" FWHM synthesized beam, provide precise locations for 695 submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) responsible for the submillimeter emission corresponding to 606 sources in the low resolution, single-dish map. We measure the number counts of SMGs brighter than $S_{\rm 870}\geq$ 4 mJy, free from the effects of blending and show that the normalisation of the counts falls by 28 $\pm$ 2% in comparison to the SCUBA-2 parent sample, but that the shape remains unchanged. We determine that 44$^{+16}_{-14}$% of the brighter single-dish sources with $S_{850}\geq$ 9 mJy consist of a blend of two or more ALMA-detectable SMGs brighter than $S_{870}\sim$ 1 mJy (corresponding to a galaxy with a total-infrared luminosity of $L_{IR}\geq$ 10$^{12}$ L$_\odot$), in comparison to 28 $\pm$ 2% for the single-dish sources at $S_{\rm 850}\geq$ 5 mJy. Using the 46 single-dish submillimeter sources that contain two or more ALMA-detected SMGs with photometric redshifts, we show that there is a significant statistical excess of pairs of SMGs with similar redshifts ($<$1% probability of occurring by chance), suggesting that at least 30% of these blends arise from physically associated pairs of SMGs.},

From stacking the high-resolution ($\sim0.15"$ full-width half maximum) ALMA $870\mu$m imaging, we show that the [CII] line emission is more extended than the continuum dust emission, with an average effective radius for the [CII] of $r_{\rm e} = 1.7^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$kpc compared to $r_{\rm e} = 1.0\pm0.1$kpc for the continuum (rest-frame $160\mu$m). By fitting the far-infrared photometry for these galaxies from $100$-$870\mu$m, we show that SMGs at $z\sim4.5$ have a median dust temperature of $T_{\rm d}=55\pm4$K. This is systematically warmer than $870\mu$m-selected SMGs at $z\simeq2$, which typically have temperatures around $35$K. These $z\simeq4.5$ SMGs display a steeper trend in the luminosity-temperature plane than $z\le2$ SMGs. We discuss the implications of this result in terms of the selection biases of high redshift starbursts in far-infrared/submillimeter surveys.},

  abstract    = {We present HCN J=4-3 and HCO^+ J=4-3 maps of six nearby star-forming galaxies, NGC 253, NGC 1068, IC 342, M82, M83, and NGC 6946, obtained with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as part of the MALATANG survey. All galaxies were mapped in the central 2 arcmin $\times$ 2 arcmin region at 14 arcsec (FWHM) resolution (corresponding to linear scales of ~ 0.2-1.0 kpc). The L_IR-L'_dense relation, where the dense gas is traced by the HCN J=4-3 and the HCO^+ J=4-3 emission, measured in our sample of spatially-resolved galaxies is found to follow the linear correlation established globally in galaxies within the scatter. We find that the luminosity ratio, L_IR/L'_dense, shows systematic variations with L_IR within individual spatially resolved galaxies, whereas the galaxy-integrated ratios vary little. A rising trend is also found between L_IR/L'_dense ratio and the warm-dust temperature gauged by the 70 \mu m/100 \mu m flux ratio. We find the luminosity ratios of IR/HCN(4-3) and IR/HCO^+(4-3), which can be taken as a proxy for the efficiency of star formation in the dense molecular gas (SFE_dense), appears to be nearly independent of the dense-gas fraction (f_dense) for our sample of galaxies. The SFE of the total molecular gas (SFE_mol) is found to increase substantially with f_dense when combining our data with that on local (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies and high-z quasars. The mean L'_HCN(4-3)/L'_HCO^+(4-3) line ratio measured for the six targeted galaxies is 0.9+/-0.6. No significant correlation is found for the L'_HCN(4-3)/L'_HCO^+(4-3) ratio with the SFR as traced by L_IR, nor with the warm-dust temperature, for the different populations of galaxies.},

  abstract    = {We present results from the first all-sky radio survey in circular polarisation. The survey uses the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) to cover 30900 sq. deg., over declinations south of +30$^{\circ}$ and north of -86$^{\circ}$ centred at 200 MHz (over a 169-231 MHz band). We achieve a spatial resolution of approx. 3' and a typical sensitivity of 3.0 mJy PSF$^{-1}$ over most of the survey region. We demonstrate a new leakage mitigation technique that reduces the leakage from total intensity into circular polarisation by an order of magnitude. In a blind survey of the imaged region, we detect 14 pulsars in circular polarisation above a 6$\sigma$ threshold. We also detect six transient sources associated with artificial satellites. A targeted survey of 2376 pulsars within the surveyed region yielded 33 detections above $4\sigma$. Looking specifically at pulsars previously detected at 200 MHz in total intensity, this represents a 35% detection rate. We also conducted a targeted survey of 2400 known flare stars, this resulted in two tentative detections above $4\sigma$. A similar targeted search for 1506 known exoplanets in the field yielded no detections above $4\sigma$. The success of the survey suggests that similar surveys at longer wavelength bands and of deeper fields are warranted.},

  title        = {Herschel Planetary Nebula Survey (HerPlaNS): Hydrogen Recombination Laser Lines in Mz 3},
  abstract     = {The bipolar nebula Menzel 3 (Mz 3) was observed as part of the \textit{Herschel} Planetary Nebula Survey (\textit{HerPlaNS}), which used the PACS and SPIRE instruments aboard the \textit{Herschel Space Observatory} to study a sample of planetary nebulae (PNe). In this paper, one of the series describing \textit{HerPlaNS} results, we report the detection of H I recombination lines (HRLs) in the spectrum of Mz 3. Inspection of the spectrum reveals the presence of 12 HRLs in the 55 to 680 $\mu$m range covered by the PACS and SPIRE instruments (H11$\alpha$ to H21$\alpha$ and H14$\beta$). The presence of HRLs in this range is unusual for PNe and has not been reported in Mz 3 before. Our analysis indicates that the HRLs we observed are enhanced by laser effect occurring in the core of Mz 3. Our arguments for this are: (i) the available Mz 3 optical to submillimetre HRL $\alpha$ line intensity ratios are not well reproduced by the spontaneous emission of optically thin ionized gas, as would be typical for nebular gas in PNe; (ii) the compact core of Mz 3 is responsible for a large fraction of the Herschel HRLs emission; (iii) the line intensity ratios for Mz 3 are very similar to those in the core emission of the well known star MWC 349A, where laser effect is responsible for the enhancement of HRLs in the Herschel wavelength range; (iv) the physical characteristics relevant to cause laser effect in the core of MWC 349A are very similar to those in the core of Mz 3.},

  abstract    = {We present results of a deep spectroscopic survey designed to quantify the statistics of the escape of ionizing photons from star-forming galaxies at z~3. We measure the ratio of ionizing to non-ionizing UV flux density <f900/f1500>_obs, where f900 is the mean flux density evaluated over the range [880,910] A. We quantify the emergent ratio of ionizing to non-ionizing UV flux density by analyzing high-S/N composite spectra formed from sub-samples with common observed properties and numbers sufficient to reduce the statistical uncertainty in the modeled IGM+CGM correction to obtain precise values of <f900/f1500>_out, including a full-sample average <f900/f1500>_out=$0.057\pm0.006$. We further show that <f900/f1500>_out increases monotonically with Ly$\alpha$ rest equivalent width, inducing an inverse correlation with UV luminosity as a by-product. We fit the composite spectra using stellar spectral synthesis together with models of the ISM in which a fraction f_c of the stellar continuum is covered by gas with column density N(HI). We show that the composite spectra simultaneously constrain the intrinsic properties of the stars (L900/L1500)_int along with f_c, N(HI), E(B-V), and $f_{esc,abs}$, the absolute escape fraction of ionizing photons. We find a sample-averaged $f_{esc,abs} =0.09\pm0.01$, and that subsamples fall along a linear relation $\langle f_{esc,abs}\rangle \sim 0.75[W(Ly\alpha)/110 A]$. We use the FUV luminosity function, the distribution function $n[W(Ly\alpha)]$, and the relationship between $W(Ly\alpha)$ and <f900/f1500>_out to estimate the total ionizing emissivity of $z\sim3$ star-forming galaxies with Muv < -19.5: $\epsilon_{LyC}\sim 6\times10^{24}$ ergs/s/Hz/Mpc$^3$, exceeding the contribution of QSOs by a factor of $\sim 3$, and accounting for $\sim50$% of the total $\epsilon_{LyC}$ at $z\sim3$ estimated using indirect methods.},

  abstract    = {For the past 400 years, astronomers have sought to observe and interpret the Universe by building more powerful telescopes. These incredible instruments extend the capabilities of one of our most important senses, sight, towards new limits such as increased sensitivity and resolution, new dimensions such as exploration of wavelengths across the full electromagnetic spectrum, new information content such as analysis through spectroscopy, and new cadences such as rapid time-series views of the variable sky. The results from these investments, from small to large telescopes on the ground and in space, have completely transformed our understanding of the Universe; including the discovery that Earth is not the center of the Universe, that the Milky Way is one among many galaxies in the Universe, that relic cosmic background radiation fills all space in the early Universe, that that the expansion rate of the Universe is accelerating, that exoplanets are common around stars, that gravitational waves exist, and much more. For modern astronomical research, the next wave of breakthroughs in fields ranging over planetary, stellar, galactic, and extragalactic science motivate a general-purpose observatory that is optimized at near- and mid-infrared wavelengths, and that has much greater sensitivity, resolution, and spectroscopic multiplexing than all previous telescopes. This scientific vision, from measuring the composition of rocky worlds in the nearby Milky Way galaxy to finding the first sources of light in the Universe to other topics at the forefront of modern astrophysics, motivates the state-of-the-art James Webb Space Telescope (Webb). In this review paper, I summarize the design and technical capabilities of Webb and the scientific opportunities that it enables.},

ZFOURGE covers a total of 400 arcmin$^{2}$ in cosmic fields CDFS, COSMOS and UDS, overlapping CANDELS. We present photometric catalogs comprising $\gt$70,000 galaxies, selected from ultradeep K $_{ s }$-band detection images (25.5-26.5 AB mag, 5{$\sigma$}, total), and $\gt$80\% complete to K $_{ s }$ $\lt$ 25.3-25.9 AB. We use 5 near-IR medium-bandwidth filters (J $_{1}$, J $_{2}$, J $_{3}$, H $_{ s }$, H $_{ l }$) as well as broad-band K $_{ s }$ at 1.05-2.16 {$\mu$}m to 25-26 AB at a seeing of {\tilde}0.{\Prime}5. Each field has ancillary imaging in 26-40 filters at 0.3-8 {$\mu$}m. We derive photometric redshifts and stellar population properties. Comparing with spectroscopic redshifts indicates a photometric redshift uncertainty {$\sigma$} $_{ z }$ = 0.010, 0.009, and 0.011 in CDFS, COSMOS, and UDS. As spectroscopic samples are often biased toward bright and blue sources, we also inspect the photometric redshift differences between close pairs of galaxies, finding {$\sigma$} $_{ z,pairs}$ = 0.01-0.02 at 1 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2.5. We quantify how {$\sigma$} $_{ z,pairs}$ depends on redshift, magnitude, spectral energy distribution type, and the inclusion of FourStar medium bands. {$\sigma$} $_{ z,pairs}$ is smallest for bright, blue star-forming samples, while red star-forming galaxies have the worst {$\sigma$} $_{ z,pairs}$. Including FourStar medium bands reduces {$\sigma$} $_{ z,pairs}$ by 50\% at 1.5 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2.5. We calculate star formation rates (SFRs) based on ultraviolet and ultradeep far-IR Spitzer/MIPS and Herschel/PACS data. We derive rest-frame U - V and V - J colors, and illustrate how these correlate with specific SFR and dust emission to z = 3.5. We confirm the existence of quiescent galaxies at z {\tilde} 3, demonstrating their SFRs are suppressed by $\gt$ {\times}15.

  abstract      = {We present results from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) photometric redshift methods investigation. In this investigation, the results from 11 participants, each using a different combination of photometric redshift code, template spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and priors, are used to examine the properties of photometric redshifts applied to deep fields with broadband multi-wavelength coverage. The photometry used includes U-band through mid-infrared filters and was derived using the TFIT method. Comparing the results, we find that there is no particular code or set of template SEDs that results in significantly better photometric redshifts compared to others. However, we find that codes producing the lowest scatter and outlier fraction utilize a training sample to optimize photometric redshifts by adding zero-point offsets, template adjusting, or adding extra smoothing errors. These results therefore stress the importance of the training procedure. We find a strong dependence of the photometric redshift accuracy on the signal-to-noise ratio of the photometry. On the other hand, we find a weak dependence of the photometric redshift scatter with redshift and galaxy color. We find that most photometric redshift codes quote redshift errors (e.g., 68\% confidence intervals) that are too small compared to that expected from the spectroscopic control sample. We find that all codes show a statistically significant bias in the photometric redshifts. However, the bias is in all cases smaller than the scatter; the latter therefore dominates the errors. Finally, we find that combining results from multiple codes significantly decreases the photometric redshift scatter and outlier fraction. We discuss different ways of combining data to produce accurate photometric redshifts and error estimates.},

The NMBS catalogs contain \~{}13,000 galaxies at z $\gt$ 1.5 with accurate photometric redshifts and rest-frame colors. Due to the increased spectral resolution obtained with the five NIR medium-band filters, the median 68\% confidence intervals of the photometric redshifts of both quiescent and star-forming galaxies are a factor of about two times smaller when comparing catalogs with medium-band NIR photometry to NIR broadband photometry.

We use VIMOS high-resolution spectra (GG475 filter) to spectroscopically select 490 galaxies in and around the super-structure and an additional 481 galaxies in the line of sight. We present the redshift distribution, the catalog to be made public and the first results on the properties of individual galaxies and stacked spectra (3500{\AA}<\lambda<4200{\AA} rest-frame). We probe a wide range of densities and environments (from low-density field to clusters and rich groups). We find a decrease in the median star formation rate from low to high density environments in all bins of stellar mass and a sharp rise of the quenched fraction (from ~10% to ~40-60%) of intermediate stellar mass galaxies $(10<\log_{10}\left(M_\star/\mathrm{M_\odot}\right)<10.75)$ from filaments to clusters. The quenched fraction for massive galaxies shows little dependence on the environment being constant at ~30-40%. We find a break in the strength of the [OII] emission, with nearly constant line equivalent widths at lower densities (~-11{\AA}) and then a drop to ~-2.5{\AA} towards higher densities. The break in the [OII] line strength happens at similar densities ($\log_{10}(1+\delta)\sim0.0-0.5$) as the observed rise in the quenched fraction. Our results may provide further clues regarding the different environmental processes affecting galaxies with different stellar masses and highlight the advantages of a single dataset in the COSMOS field probing a wide range of stellar masses and environments. We hypothesize that quenching mechanisms are enhanced in high-density regions.},

  title       = {A Galaxy Redshift Survey near HST/COS AGN Sight Lines},
  abstract    = {To establish the connection between galaxies and UV-detected absorption systems in the local universe, a deep ($g\leq20$) and wide ($\sim20^{\prime}$ radius) galaxy redshift survey is presented around 47 sight lines to UV-bright AGN observed by the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS). Specific COS science team papers have used this survey to connect absorbers to galaxies, groups of galaxies, and large-scale structures, including voids. Here we present the technical details of the survey and the basic measurements required for its use, including redshifts for individual galaxies and uncertainties determined collectively by spectral class (emission-line, absorption-line, and composite spectra) and completeness for each sight line as a function of impact parameter and magnitude. For most of these sight lines the design criteria of $>90$% completeness over a $>1$~Mpc region down to $\lesssim0.1\,L^*$ luminosities at $z\leq0.1$ allows a plausible association between low-$z$ absorbers and individual galaxies. Ly$\alpha$ covering fractions are computed to approximate the star-forming and passive galaxy populations using the spectral classes above. In agreement with previous results, the covering fraction of star-forming galaxies with $L\geq0.3\,L^*$ is consistent with unity inside one virial radius and declines slowly to $>50$% at 4 virial radii. On the other hand, passive galaxies have lower covering fractions ($\sim60$%) and a shallower decline with impact parameter, suggesting that their gaseous halos are patchy but have a larger scale-length than star-forming galaxies. All spectra obtained by this project are made available electronically for individual measurement and use.},

Our catalog consists of a total of 131,678 sources. We evaluate the z $_{phot}$ quality by comparing z $_{phot}$ with spectroscopic redshifts (z $_{spec}$) when available, and find a value of normalized median absolute deviation {$\sigma$}$_{NMAD}$ = 0.029 and an outlier fraction of 5.5\% (outliers are defined as sources having |z$_{phot}$ - z$_{spec}$ |/(1 + z$_{spec}$ ) $\gt$ 0.15) for non-X-ray sources. More specifically, we obtain {$\sigma$}$_{NMAD}$ = 0.024 with 2.7\% outliers for sources brighter than R = 23 mag, {$\sigma$}$_{NMAD}$ = 0.035 with 7.4\% outliers for sources fainter than R = 23 mag, {$\sigma$}$_{NMAD}$ = 0.026 with 3.9\% outliers for sources having z $\lt$ 1, and {$\sigma$}$_{NMAD}$ = 0.034 with 9.0\% outliers for sources having z $\gt$ 1. Our z $_{phot}$ quality shows an overall improvement over an earlier z $_{phot}$ work that focused only on the central H-HDF-N area. We also classify each object as a star or galaxy through template spectral energy distribution fitting and complementary morphological parameterization, resulting in 4959 stars and 126,719 galaxies. Furthermore, we match our catalog with the 2 Ms Chandra Deep Field-North main X-ray catalog. For the 462 matched non-stellar X-ray sources (281 having z $_{spec}$), we improve their z $_{phot}$ quality by adding three additional active galactic nucleus templates, achieving {$\sigma$}$_{NMAD}$ = 0.035 and an outlier fraction of 12.5\%. We make our catalog publicly available presenting both photometry and z $_{phot}$, and provide guidance on how to make use of our catalog.},

The instrument Phase 0 study is supported by the French Space Agency (CNES) and performed by a consortium of European scientists. POLLUX has been designed to deliver high-resolution spectroscopy (R$\gt$ 120,000) over a broad spectral range (90-390 nm). Its unique spectropolarimetric capabilities will open-up a vast new parameter space, in particular in the unexplored UV domain and in a regime where high-resolution observations with current facilities in the visible domain are severely photon starved. POLLUX will address a range of questions at the core of the LUVOIR Science portfolio. The combination of high resolution and broad coverage of the UV bandpass will resolve narrow UV emission and absorption lines originating in diffuse media, thus permitting the study of the baryon cycle over cosmic time: from galaxies forming stars out of interstellar gas and grains, and stars forming planets, to the various forms of feedback into the interstellar and intergalactic medium (ISM and IGM), and active galactic nuclei (AGN). UV circular and linear polarimetry will reveal the magnetic fields for a wide variety of objects for the first time, from AGN outflows to a diverse range of stars, stellar explosions (both supernovae and their remnants), the ISM and IGM. It will enable detection of polarized light reflected from exoplanets (or their circumplanetary material and moons), characterization of the magnetospheres of stars and planets (and their interactions), and measurements of the influence of magnetic fields at the (inter)galactic scale. In this paper, we outline the key science cases of POLLUX, together with its high-level technical requirements. The instrument design, its estimated performances, and the required technology development are presented in a separated paper.},

Most observations of GLQs correspond to an ongoing long-term macro-programme with 2$-$10 m telescopes at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, and these data provide information on the distribution of dark matter at all scales.

  abstract      = {We calculate stellar masses for {\tilde}400 000 massive luminous galaxies at redshift {\tilde}0.2-0.7 using the first two years of data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Stellar masses are obtained by fitting model spectral energy distributions to u, g, r, i, z magnitudes, and simulations with mock galaxies are used to understand how well the templates recover the stellar mass. Accurate BOSS spectroscopic redshifts are used to constrain the fits. We find that the distribution of stellar masses in BOSS is narrow ({$\Delta$}log M {\tilde} 0.5 dex) and peaks at about log M/M$_{⊙}$ {\tilde} 11.3 (for a Kroupa initial stellar mass function), and that the mass sampling is uniform over the redshift range 0.2-0.6, in agreement with the intended BOSS target selection. The galaxy masses probed by BOSS extend over {\tilde}10$^{12}$ M$_{⊙}$, providing unprecedented measurements of the high-mass end of the galaxy mass function. We find that the galaxy number density above {\tilde}2.5 {\times} 10$^{11}$ M$_{⊙}$ agrees with previous determinations. We perform a comparison with semi-analytic galaxy formation models tailored to the BOSS target selection and volume, in order to contain incompleteness. The abundance of massive galaxies in the models compare fairly well with the BOSS data, but the models lack galaxies at the massive end. Moreover, no evolution with redshift is detected from {\tilde}0.6 to 0.4 in the data, whereas the abundance of massive galaxies in the models increases to redshift zero. Additionally, BOSS data display colour-magnitude (mass) relations similar to those found in the local Universe, where the most massive galaxies are the reddest. On the other hand, the model colours do not display a dependence on stellar mass, span a narrower range and are typically bluer than the observations. We argue that the lack of a colour-mass relation for massive galaxies in the models is mostly due to metallicity, which is too low in the models.},

GSWLC contains galaxies within the Galaxy Evolution Explorer footprint, regardless of a UV detection, covering 90\% of SDSS. The physical properties were obtained from UV/optical spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting following Bayesian methodology of Salim et al., with improvements such as blending corrections for low-resolution UV photometry, flexible dust attenuation laws, and emission-line corrections. GSWLC also includes mid-IR SFRs derived from IR templates based on 22 {$\mu$} $\{$$\{$m$\}$$\}$ Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer observations. These estimates are independent of UV/optical SED fitting, in order to separate possible systematics. The paper argues that the comparison of specific SFRs (sSFRs) is more informative and physically motivated than the comparison of SFRs. The sSFRs resulting from the UV/optical SED fitting are compared to the mid-IR sSFRs and to sSFRs from three published catalogs. For {\ldquo}main-sequence{\rdquo} galaxies with no active galactic nucleus (AGN) all sSFRs are in very good agreement (within 0.1 dex on average). In particular, the widely used aperture-corrected SFRs from the MPA/JHU catalog show no systematic offsets, in contrast to some integral field spectroscopy results. For galaxies below the main sequence (log sSFR $\lt$ -11), mid-IR (s)SFRs based on fixed luminosity{\ndash}SFR conversion are severely biased (up to 2 dex) because the dust is primarily heated by old stars. Furthermore, mid-IR (s)SFRs are overestimated by up to 0.6 dex for galaxies with AGNs, presumably due to nonstellar dust heating. UV/optical (s)SFRs are thus preferred to IR-based (s)SFRs for quenched galaxies and those that host AGNs.},

Using MAGPHYS, we then simultaneously and consistently model both the attenuated stellar SED and the dust emission at 12 and 22 {$\mu$}m, producing robust new calibrations for monochromatic mid-IR star formation rate (SFR) proxies. These modeling results provide the first mid-IR-based view of the bimodality in star formation activity among galaxies, exhibiting the sequence of star-forming galaxies ({\ldquo}main sequence{\rdquo}) with a slope of d $\{$log$\}$ $\{$SFR$\}$/d$\{$log$\}$$\{$M$\}$$_{*}$ = 0.80 and a scatter of 0.39 dex. We find that these new SFRs along the SF main sequence are systematically lower by a factor of 1.4 than those derived from optical spectroscopy. We show that for most present-day galaxies, the 0.4-22 {$\mu$}m SED fits can exquisitely predict the fluxes measured by Herschel at much longer wavelengths. Our analysis also illustrates that the majority of stars in the present-day universe are formed in luminous galaxies ({\tilde} $\{$L$\}$$^{*}$) in and around the {\ldquo}green valley{\rdquo} of the color-luminosity plane.

  abstract      = {We present a catalogue of distances, masses and ages for $\sim3$ million stars observed by Gaia with spectroscopic parameters available from the large spectroscopic surveys: APOGEE, Gaia-ESO, GALAH, LAMOST, RAVE and SEGUE. We use a Bayesian framework to characterise the probability density functions of distance, mass and age using photometric, spectroscopic and astrometric information, supplemented with spectroscopic masses where available for giant stars. Furthermore, we provide posterior extinction estimates ($A\_V$) to every star using published extinction maps as a prior input. We provide an appendix with extinction coefficients for Gaia photometry derived from stellar models, which account for variation with intrinsic colour and total extinction. Our pipeline provides output estimates of the spectroscopic parameters, which can be used to inform improved spectroscopic analysis. We complement our catalogues with Galactocentric coordinates and actions with associated uncertainties. As a demonstration of the power of our catalogue, we produce velocity dispersion profiles of the disc separated by age and Galactocentric radius. This suggests that the velocity dispersion profiles flatten with radius in the outer Galaxy and that at all radii the velocity dispersion follows the smooth power law with age observed in the solar neighbourhood.},

  abstract      = {We present the Hubble Deep UV Legacy Survey (HDUV), a 132 orbit imaging program with the WFC3/UVIS camera onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The HDUV extends and builds on the few previous UV imaging surveys in the two GOODS/CANDELS-Deep fields to provide deep images over a total area of \~{}100 arcmin2 in the two filters F275W and F336W. Our release also includes all the F275W imaging data taken by the CANDELS survey, which were aligned using a novel approach and combined with the HDUV survey data. By reaching depths of 27.5-28.0 mag (5sigma, in 0.4`` apertures), these are the deepest high-resolution UV data over such a large area taken to date. Such unique UV imaging enables a wide range of science by the community. Among the main goals of the HDUV survey are: (1) provide a complete sample of faint star-forming galaxies at z\~{}1-3, (2) constrain the ionizing photon escape fraction from galaxies at z\~{}2-3, and (3) track the build-up of bulges and the disappearance of clumpy disk galaxies through reliable internal stellar population properties at sub-kpc resolution out to z\~{}3. The addition of the HDUV data further enhances the legacy value of the two GOODS/CANDELS-Deep fields, which now include deep 11-band HST imaging as well as very deep ancillary data from X-ray to radio, enabling unique multi-wavelength studies. Here, we provide an overview of the survey design, describe the data reduction, and highlight a few basic analyses on the images which are released to the community as high level science products via the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST).},

  abstract      = {Several works have found an increase of the abundances of the s-process neutron-capture elements in the youngest Galactic stellar populations, giving important constraints to stellar and Galactic evolution. We aim to trace the abundance patterns and the time-evolution of five s-process elements in the first peak, Y and Zr, and in the second peak, Ba, La and Ce using the Gaia-ESO idr5 results. From the UVES spectra of cluster member stars, we determined the average composition of clusters with ages $\gt$0.1 Gyr. We derived statistical ages and distances of field stars, and we separated them in thin and thick disc populations. We studied the time evolution and dependence on metallicity of abundance ratios using open clusters and field stars. Using our large and homogeneous sample of open clusters, thin and thick disc stars, spanning an age range larger than 10 Gyr, we confirm an increase towards young ages of s-process abundances in the Solar neighbourhood. These trends are well defined for open clusters and stars located nearby the solar position and they may be explained by a late enrichment due to significant contribution to the production of these elements from long-living low-mass stars. At the same time, we found a strong dependence of the s-process abundance ratios with the Galactocentric distance and with the metallicity of the clusters and field stars. Our results, derived from the largest and homogeneous sample of s-process abundances in the literature, confirm the growth with decreasing stellar ages of the s-process abundances in both field and open cluster stars. At the same time, taking advantage of the abundances of open clusters located in a wide Galactocentric range, they open a new view on the dependence of the s-process evolution on the metallicity and star formation history, pointing to different behaviours at various Galactocentric distances.},

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) large project (\~{}600 hours) for measuring the physical properties of Galactic neutral hydrogen (HI). 21-SPONGE is distinguished among previous Galactic HI studies as a result of: (1) exceptional optical depth sensitivity ($\sigma\_{\tau} \lt 10^{-3}$ per $0.42\rm\,km\,s^{-1}$ channels over 57 lines of sight); (2) matching 21 cm emission spectra with highest-possible angular resolution (\~{}4') from the Arecibo Observatory; (3) detailed comparisons with numerical simulations for assessing observational biases. We autonomously decompose 21 cm spectra and derive the physical properties (i.e., spin temperature, $T\_s$, column density) of the cold neutral medium (CNM; $T\_s\lt250\rm\,K$), thermally unstable medium (UNM; $250\lt T\_s \lt 1000\rm\,K$) and warm neutral medium (WNM; $T\_s \gt 1000\rm\,K$) simultaneously. We detect 50\% of the total HI mass in absorption, the majority of which is CNM (56 +/- 10\%, corresponding to 28\% of the total HI mass). Although CNM is detected ubiquitously, the CNM fraction along most lines of sight is $\lt$50\%. We find that 20\% of the total HI mass is thermally unstable (41 +/- 10\% of HI detected in absorption), with no significant variation with Galactic environment. Finally, although the WNM comprises 52\% of the total HI mass, we detect little evidence for WNM absorption with $1000\ltT\_s\lt4000\rm\,K$. Following spectral modeling, we detect a stacked residual absorption feature corresponding to WNM with $T\_s\sim10^4\rm\,K$. We conclude that excitation in excess of collisions likely produces significantly higher WNM $T\_s$ than predicted by steady-state models.},

  abstract      = {The Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS) is a large spectroscopic campaign at the Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT) aimed at bridging the near and distant Universe by producing the highest completeness survey of galaxies and groups at intermediate redshifts ($0.3\ltz\lt1.0$). Our sample consists of $\sim$60,000 galaxies to Y$\lt$21.2mag, over $\sim$6deg$^{2}$ in three well-studied deep extragalactic fields (Cosmic Origins Survey field, COSMOS, Extended Chandra Deep Field South, ECDFS and the X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission Large-Scale Structure region, XMM-LSS - all Large Synoptic Survey Telescope deep-drill fields). This paper presents the broad experimental design of DEVILS. Our target sample has been selected from deep Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA) Y-band imaging (VISTA Deep Extragalactic Observations, VIDEO and UltraVISTA), with photometry measured by ProFound. Photometric star/galaxy separation is done on the basis of NIR colours, and has been validated by visual inspection. To maximise our observing efficiency for faint targets we employ a redshift feedback strategy, which continually updates our target lists, feeding back the results from the previous night's observations. We also present an overview of the initial spectroscopic observations undertaken in late 2017 and early 2018.},

In 2001 June, the SDSS released to the general astronomical community its early data release, roughly 462 deg$^{2}$ of imaging data including almost 14 million detected objects and 54,008 follow-up spectra. The imaging data were collected in drift-scan mode in five bandpasses (u, g, r, i, and z); our 95\% completeness limits for stars are 22.0, 22.2, 22.2, 21.3, and 20.5, respectively. The photometric calibration is reproducible to 5\%, 3\%, 3\%, 3\%, and 5\%, respectively. The spectra are flux- and wavelength-calibrated, with 4096 pixels from 3800 to 9200 {\AA} at R\~{}1800. We present the means by which these data are distributed to the astronomical community, descriptions of the hardware used to obtain the data, the software used for processing the data, the measured quantities for each observed object, and an overview of the properties of this data set.},

  abstract = {We present bright galaxy number counts in five broad bands (u', g', r', i', z') from imaging data taken during the commissioning phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The counts are derived from two independent stripes of imaging scans along the celestial equator, one each toward the northern and the southern Galactic cap, covering about 230 and 210 deg$^{2}$, respectively. A careful study is made to verify the reliability of the photometric catalog. For galaxies brighter than r*=16, the catalog produced by automated software is examined against eye inspection of all objects. Statistically meaningful results on the galaxy counts are obtained in the magnitude range 12$\lt$=r*$\lt$=21, using a sample of 900,000 galaxies. The counts from the two stripes differ by about 30\% at magnitudes brighter than r*=15.5, consistent with a local 2 {$\sigma$} fluctuation due to large-scale structure in the galaxy distribution. The shape of the number counts-magnitude relation brighter than r*=16 is well characterized by N\~{}10$^{0.6m}$, the relation expected for a homogeneous galaxy distribution in a ``Euclidean'' universe. In the magnitude range 16$\lt$r*$\lt$21, the galaxy counts from both stripes agree very well and follow the prediction of the no-evolution model, although the data do not exclude a small amount of evolution. We use empirically determined color transformations to derive the galaxy number counts in the B and I$_{814}$ bands. We compute the luminosity density of the universe at zero redshift in the five SDSS bands and in the B band. We find L$_{B}$=2.4+/-0.4{\times}10$^{8}$ L$_{solar}$ h Mpc$^{-3}$, for a reasonably wide range of parameters of the Schechter luminosity function in the B band.

  abstract = {In the course of its commissioning observations, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has produced one of the largest redshift samples of galaxies selected from CCD images. Using 11,275 galaxies complete to r$^{*}$=17.6 over 140 deg$^{2}$, we compute the luminosity function of galaxies in the r$^{*}$ band over a range -23$\lt$M$_{r<SUP>*</SUP>}$$\lt$-16 (for h=1). The result is well-described by a Schechter function with parameters {\phis}$_{*}$=(1.46+/-0.12){\times}10$^{-2}$ h$^{3}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, M$_{*}$=-20.83+/-0.03, and {$\alpha$}=-1.20+/-0.03. The implied luminosity density in r$^{*}$ is j\~{}(2.6+/-0.3){\times}10$^{8}$h L$_{solar}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. We find that the surface brightness selection threshold has a negligible impact for M$_{r<SUP>*</SUP>}$$\lt$-18. Using subsets of the data, we measure the luminosity function in the u$^{*}$, g$^{*}$, i$^{*}$, and z$^{*}$ bands as well; the slope at low luminosities ranges from {$\alpha$}=-1.35 to {$\alpha$}=-1.2. We measure the bivariate distribution of r$^{*}$ luminosity with half-light surface brightness, intrinsic g$^{*}$-r$^{*}$ color, and morphology. In agreement with previous studies, we find that high surface brightness, red, highly concentrated galaxies are on average more luminous than low surface brightness, blue, less concentrated galaxies. An important feature of the SDSS luminosity function is the use of Petrosian magnitudes, which measure a constant fraction of a galaxy's total light regardless of the amplitude of its surface brightness profile. If we synthesize results for R$_{GKC}$ band or b$_{j}$ band using these Petrosian magnitudes, we obtain luminosity densities 2 times that found by the Las Campanas Redshift Survey in R$_{GKC}$ and 1.4 times that found by the Two Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey in b$_{j}$. However, we are able to reproduce the luminosity functions obtained by these surveys if we also mimic their isophotal limits for defining galaxy magnitudes, which are shallower and more redshift dependent than the Petrosian magnitudes used by the SDSS. Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.},

  abstract      = {We present the Survey for High-z Absorption Red and Dead Sources (SHARDS), an ESO/GTC Large Program carried out using the OSIRIS instrument on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). SHARDS is an ultra-deep optical spectro-photometric survey of the GOODS-N field covering 130 arcmin$^{2}$ at wavelengths between 500 and 950 nm with 24 contiguous medium-band filters (providing a spectral resolution R \~{} 50). The data reach an AB magnitude of 26.5 (at least at a 3{$\sigma$} level) with sub-arcsec seeing in all bands. SHARDS' main goal is to obtain accurate physical properties of intermediate- and high-z galaxies using well-sampled optical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with sufficient spectral resolution to measure absorption and emission features, whose analysis will provide reliable stellar population and active galactic nucleus (AGN) parameters. Among the different populations of high-z galaxies, SHARDS' principal targets are massive quiescent galaxies at z $\gt$ 1, whose existence is one of the major challenges facing current hierarchical models of galaxy formation. In this paper, we outline the observational strategy and include a detailed discussion of the special reduction and calibration procedures which should be applied to the GTC/OSIRIS data. An assessment of the SHARDS data quality is also performed. We present science demonstration results on the detection and study of emission-line galaxies (star-forming objects and AGNs) at z = 0-5. We also analyze the SEDs for a sample of 27 quiescent massive galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the range 1.0 $\lt$ z $\lt$\~{} 1.4. We discuss the improvements introduced by the SHARDS data set in the analysis of their star formation history and stellar properties. We discuss the systematics arising from the use of different stellar population libraries, typical in this kind of study. Averaging the results from the different libraries, we find that the UV-to-MIR SEDs of the massive quiescent galaxies at z = 1.0-1.4 are well described by an exponentially decaying star formation history with scale {$\tau$} = 100-200 Myr, age around 1.5-2.0 Gyr, solar or slightly sub-solar metallicity, and moderate extinction, A(V) \~{} 0.5 mag. We also find that galaxies with masses above M* are typically older than lighter galaxies, as expected in a downsizing scenario of galaxy formation. This trend is, however, model dependent, i.e., it is significantly more evident in the results obtained with some stellar population synthesis libraries, and almost absent in others.},

In particular, we examine galaxies best fitted by two structural components, and thus likely forming discs and bulges. We examine the stellar mass, star formation rates (SFRs) and colours of both the inner 'bulge' and outer 'disc' components for these systems using Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) information from the resolved ACS+WFC3 HST imaging. We find that the majority of both inner and outer components lie in the star-forming region of UVJ space (68 and 90 per cent, respectively). However, the inner portions, or the likely forming bulges, are dominated by dusty star formation. Furthermore, we show that the outer components of these systems have a higher SFR than their inner regions, and the ratio of SFR between 'disc' and 'bulge' increases at lower redshifts. Despite the higher SFR of the outer component, the stellar mass ratio of inner to outer component remains constant through this epoch. This suggests that there is mass transfer from the outer to inner components for typical two-component-forming systems, thus building bulges from discs. Finally, using Chandra data we find that the presence of an active galactic nucleus is more common in both one-component spheroid-like galaxies and two-component systems (13 {\plusmn} 3 and 11 {\plusmn} 2 per cent) than in one-component disc-like galaxies (3 {\plusmn} 1 per cent), demonstrating that the formation of a central inner component likely triggers the formation of central massive black holes in these galaxies.},

  abstract      = {We explore observational and theoretical constraints on how galaxies might transition between the 'star-forming main sequence' (SFMS) and varying 'degrees of quiescence' out to z = 3. Our analysis is focused on galaxies with stellar mass M$_{*}$ $\gt$ 10$^{10}$ M$_{⊙}$, and is enabled by GAMA and CANDELS observations, a semi-analytic model (SAM) of galaxy formation, and a cosmological hydrodynamical 'zoom in' simulation with momentum-driven AGN feedback. In both the observations and the SAM, transition galaxies tend to have intermediate S{\'e}rsic indices, half-light radii, and surface stellar mass densities compared to star-forming and quiescent galaxies out to z = 3. We place an observational upper limit on the average population transition time-scale as a function of redshift, finding that the average high-redshift galaxy is on a 'fast track' for quenching whereas the average low-redshift galaxy is on a 'slow track' for quenching. We qualitatively identify four physical origin scenarios for transition galaxies in the SAM: oscillations on the SFMS, slow quenching, fast quenching, and rejuvenation. Quenching time-scales in both the SAM and the hydrodynamical simulation are not fast enough to reproduce the quiescent population that we observe at z {\sim} 3. In the SAM, we do not find a clear-cut morphological dependence of quenching time-scales, but we do predict that the mean stellar ages, cold gas fractions, SMBH (supermassive black hole) masses and halo masses of transition galaxies tend to be intermediate relative to those of star-forming and quiescent galaxies at z $\lt$ 3.},

  abstract      = {We investigate the environmental quenching of galaxies, especially those with stellar masses (M *) < 109.5 M ⊙, beyond the local universe. Essentially all local low-mass quenched galaxies (QGs) are believed to live close to massive central galaxies, which is a demonstration of environmental quenching. We use CANDELS data to test whether or not such a dwarf QG-massive central galaxy connection exists beyond the local universe. For this purpose, we only need a statistically representative, rather than complete, sample of low-mass galaxies, which enables our study to z ≳ 1.5. For each low-mass galaxy, we measure the projected distance (d proj) to its nearest massive neighbor (M * > 1010.5 M ⊙) within a redshift range. At a given z and M *, the environmental quenching effect is considered to be observed if the d proj distribution of QGs ({d}{proj}Q) is significantly skewed toward lower values than that of star-forming galaxies ({d}{proj}{SF}). For galaxies with 108 M ⊙ < M * < 1010 M ⊙, such a difference between {d}{proj}Q and {d}{proj}{SF} is detected up to z ˜ 1. Also, about 10% of the quenched galaxies in our sample are located between two and four virial radii (R Vir) of the massive halos. The median projected distance from low-mass QGs to their massive neighbors, {d}{proj}Q/{R}{Vir}, decreases with satellite M * at M * ≲ 109.5 M ⊙, but increases with satellite M * at M * ≳ 109.5 M ⊙. This trend suggests a smooth, if any, transition of the quenching timescale around M * ˜ 109.5 M ⊙ at 0.5 < z < 1.0.

The mock agrees with observed number count and redshift distribution data. We demonstrate the importance of including emission lines in the narrow band fluxes. We show that PAUCam has sufficient resolution to measure the strength of the 4000$\backslash$AA$\{$$\}$ break to the nominal PAUS depth. We predict the evolution of a narrow band luminosity function and show how this can be affected by the OII emission line. We introduce new rest frame broad bands (UV and blue) that can be derived directly from the narrow band fluxes. We use these bands along with D4000 and redshift to define galaxy samples and provide predictions for galaxy clustering measurements. We show that systematic errors in the recovery of the projected clustering due to photometric redshift errors in PAUS are significantly smaller than the expected statistical errors. The galaxy clustering on two halo scales can be recovered quantatively without correction, and all qualitative trends seen in the one halo term are recovered. In this analysis mixing between samples reduces the expected contrast between the one halo clustering of red and blue galaxies and demonstrates the importance of a mock catalogue for interpreting galaxy clustering results.

Our study is based on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) photometric galaxy catalogue,associated with photometric redshifts. We constructed LFs inside a scaled radius using a selection in photometric redshift around the cluster spectroscopic redshift in order to reduce projection effects. The width of the photometric redshift selection was carefully determined to avoid biasing the LF and depended on both the cluster redshift and the galaxy magnitudes. The purity was then enhanced by applying a precise background subtraction. We constructed composite luminosity functions (CLFs) by stacking the individual LFs and studied their evolution with redshift and richness, analysing separately the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and non-BCG members. We fitted the dependences of the CLFs and BCG distributions parameters with redshift and richness conjointly in order to distinguish between these two effects. We find that the usual photometric redshift selection methods can bias the LF estimate if the redshift and magnitude dependence of the photometric redshift quality is not taken into account. Our main findings concerning the evolution of the galaxy luminosity distribution with redshift and richness are that, in the inner region of clusters and in the redshift-mass range we probe (about $0\ltz\lt1$ and $10^{13} M\_{\odot}\ltM\_{500}\lt5\times10^{14}M\_{\odot}$), the bright part of the LF (BCG excluded) does not depend much on mass or redshift except for its amplitude, whereas the BCG luminosity increases both with redshift and richness, and its scatter decreases with redshift.},

  abstract      = {The Shocked POststarburst Galaxy Survey (SPOGS) aims to identify galaxies in the transitional phase between actively star-forming and quiescence with nebular lines that are excited from shocks rather than star formation processes. We explored the ultraviolet (UV) properties of objects with near-ultraviolet (NUV) and far-ultraviolet (FUV) photometry from archival GALEX data; 444 objects were detected in both bands, 365 in only NUV, and 24 in only FUV, for a total of 833 observed objects. We compared SPOGs to samples of Star-forming galaxies (SFs), Quiescent galaxies (Qs), classical E+A post-starburst galaxies, active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies, and interacting galaxies. We found that SPOGs have a larger range in their FUV-NUV and NUV-r colors compared to most of the other samples, although all of our comparison samples occupied color space inside of the SPOGs region. Based on their UV colors, SPOGs are a heterogeneous group, possibly made up of a mixture of SFs, Qs, and/or AGN. Using Gaussian mixture models, we are able to recreate the distribution of FUV-NUV colors of SPOGs and E+A galaxies with different combinations of SFs, Qs, and AGN. We find that the UV colors of SPOGs require a $\gt$60\% contribution from SFs, with either Qs or AGN representing the remaining contribution, while UV colors of E+A galaxies required a significantly lower fraction of SFs, supporting the idea that SPOGs are at an earlier point in their transition from quiescent to star-forming than E+A galaxies.},

  abstract      = {The Gemini Infrared Multi-Object Spectrograph (GIRMOS) is a powerful new instrument being built to facility-class standards for the Gemini telescope. It takes advantage of the latest developments in adaptive optics and integral field spectrographs. GIRMOS will carry out simultaneous high-angular-resolution, spatially-resolved infrared ($1-2.4$ $\mu$m) spectroscopy of four objects within a two-arcminute field-of-regard by taking advantage of multi-object adaptive optics. This capability does not currently exist anywhere in the world and therefore offers significant scientific gains over a very broad range of topics in astronomical research. For example, current programs for high redshift galaxies are pushing the limits of what is possible with infrared spectroscopy at $8-10$-meter class facilities by requiring up to several nights of observing time per target. Therefore, the observation of multiple objects simultaneously with adaptive optics is absolutely necessary to make effective use of telescope time and obtain statistically significant samples for high redshift science. With an expected commissioning date of 2023, GIRMOS's capabilities will also make it a key followup instrument for the James Webb Space Telescope when it is launched in 2021, as well as a true scientific and technical pathfinder for future Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) multi-object spectroscopic instrumentation. In this paper, we will present an overview of this instrument's capabilities and overall architecture. We also highlight how this instrument lays the ground work for a future TMT early-light instrument.},

  abstract      = {We present a ``super-deblended'' far-infrared to (sub)millimeter photometric catalog in the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS), prepared with the method recently developed by Liu et al. 2018, with key adaptations. We obtain point spread function (PSF) fitting photometry at fixed prior positions including 88,008 galaxies detected in either VLA 1.4\~{}GHz, 3\~{}GHz and/or MIPS 24\~{}$\mu$m images. By adding a specifically carved mass-selected sample (with an evolving stellar mass limit), a highly complete prior sample of 194,428 galaxies is achieved for deblending FIR/(sub)mm images. We performed ``active' removal of non relevant priors at FIR/(sub)mm bands using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting and redshift information. In order to cope with the shallower COSMOS data we subtract from the maps the flux of faint non-fitted priors and explicitly account for the uncertainty of this step. The resulting photometry (including data from Spitzer, Herschel, SCUBA2, AzTEC, MAMBO and NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at 3\~{}GHz and 1.4\~{}GHz) displays well behaved quasi-Gaussian uncertainties, calibrated from Monte Carlo simulations and tailored to observables (crowding, residual maps). Comparison to ALMA photometry for hundreds of sources provide a remarkable validation of the technique. We detect 11,220 galaxies over the 100--1200\~{}$\mu$m range, extending to $z\_{\rm phot}\sim7$. We conservatively selected a sample of 85 $z\gt4$ high redshift candidates, significantly detected in the FIR/(sub)mm, often with secure radio and/or Spitzer/IRAC counterparts. This provides a chance to investigate the first generation of vigorous starburst galaxies (SFRs$\sim1000\mathrm{M}\_\odot$\~{}yr$^{-1}$). The photometric and value added catalogs are publicly released.},

Our science goals are to study star and galaxy formation from the epoch of reionization to the present, investigate the growth of structure in the Universe, improve the precision of B-mode CMB measurements, and investigate the interstellar medium and star formation in the Galaxy and nearby galaxies through spectroscopic, polarimetric, and broadband surveys at wavelengths from 200 um to 2 mm. These goals are realized with our two first light instruments, a large field-of-view (FoV) bolometer-based imager called Prime-Cam (that has both camera and an imaging spectrometer modules), and a multi-beam submillimeter heterodyne spectrometer, CHAI. CCAT-prime will have very high surface accuracy and very low system emissivity, so that combined with its wide FoV at the unsurpassed CCAT site our telescope/instrumentation combination is ideally suited to pursue this science. The CCAT-prime telescope is being designed and built by Vertex Antennentechnik GmbH. We expect to achieve first light in the spring of 2021.},

  abstract      = {The third version of the XMM-Newton serendipitous catalogue (3XMM), containing almost half million sources, is now the largest X-ray catalogue. However, its full scientific potential remains untapped due to the lack of distance information (i.e. redshifts) for the majority of its sources. Here we present XMMPZCAT, a catalogue of photometric redshifts (photo-z) for 3XMM sources. We searched for optical counterparts of 3XMM-DR6 sources outside the Galactic plane in the SDSS and Pan-STARRS surveys, with the addition of near- (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) data whenever possible (2MASS, UKIDSS, VISTA-VHS, and AllWISE). We used this photometry data set in combination with a training sample of 5157 X-ray selected sources and the MLZ-TPZ package, a supervised machine learning algorithm based on decision trees and random forests for the calculation of photo-z. We have estimated photo-z for 100,178 X-ray sources, about 50\% of the total number of 3XMM sources (205,380) in the XMM-Newton fields selected to build this catalogue (4208 out of 9159). The accuracy of our results highly depends on the available photometric data, with a rate of outliers ranging from 4\% for sources with data in the optical+NIR+MIR, up to $\sim$40\% for sources with only optical data. We also addressed the reliability level of our results by studying the shape of the photo-z probability density distributions.},

This procedure has been applied to all SDSS-III Data Release 8 images, and the results are available as part of that data set. We have tested the effect of our background subtraction on the photometry of large galaxies by inserting fake galaxies into the raw pixels, reanalyzing the data, and measuring them after background subtraction. Our technique results in no size-dependent bias in galaxy fluxes up to half-light radii r $_{50}$ \~{} 100 arcsec; in contrast, for galaxies of that size the standard SDSS photometric catalog underestimates fluxes by about 1.5 mag. Our results represent a substantial improvement over the standard SDSS catalog results and should form the basis of any analysis of nearby galaxies using the SDSS imaging data.},

This will crucially enable a wide range of new and exciting time-domain science, including high redshift transient searches and monitoring (e.g., SNe), variability studies from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) to brown dwarf atmospheres, as well as proper motions of possibly extreme scattered Kuiper Belt and Inner Oort Cloud Objects, and of nearby Galactic brown dwarfs, low-mass stars, and ultracool white dwarfs.

A list of 15 EISERS candidates is presented here. It was assembled by applying a sequence of selection filters, starting with the two available large-sky radio surveys, namely the WENSS (325 MHz) and the ADR-TGSS (150 MHz). These surveys offer the twin advantages of being fairly deep (typical rms $\lt$ 10 mJy/beam) and having a sub-arcminute resolution. Their zone of overlap spreads over 1.3$\pi$ steradian in the northern hemisphere. Radio spectra are presented for the entire sample of 15 EISERS candidates, of which 8 spectra are of GPS type. Eleven members of the sample are associated with previously known quasars. Information on the parsec-scale radio structure, available for several of these sources, is also summarized.},

This data set is combined with ancillary optical and NIR fluxes to constrain the dust attenuation law in the rest-frame NUV region of star-forming galaxies within the redshift window 1.5 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3. We focus on the NUV bump strength (B) and the total-to-selective extinction ratio (R$_{V}$), targeting a sample of 1753 galaxies. By comparing the data with a set of population synthesis models coupled to a parametric dust attenuation law, we constrain R$_{V}$ and B, as well as the colour excess, E(B - V). We find a correlation between R$_{V}$ and B, which can be interpreted either as a result of the grain size distribution, or a variation of the dust geometry among galaxies. According to the former, small dust grains are associated with a stronger NUV bump. The latter would lead to a range of clumpiness in the distribution of dust within the interstellar medium of star-forming galaxies. The observed wide range of NUV bump strengths can lead to a systematic in the interpretation of the UV slope {$\beta$} typically used to characterize the dust content. In this study, we quantify these variations, concluding that the effects are {$\Delta$}{$\beta$} {\tilde} 0.4.},

  abstract      = {We present 353 GHz full-sky maps of the polarization fraction $p$, angle $\psi$, and dispersion of angles $S$ of Galactic dust thermal emission produced from the 2018 release of Planck data. We confirm that the mean and maximum of $p$ decrease with increasing $N\_H$. The uncertainty on the maximum polarization fraction, $p\_\mathrm{max}=22.0$\% at 80 arcmin resolution, is dominated by the uncertainty on the zero level in total intensity. The observed inverse behaviour between $p$ and $S$ is interpreted with models of the polarized sky that include effects from only the topology of the turbulent Galactic magnetic field. Thus, the statistical properties of $p$, $\psi$, and $S$ mostly reflect the structure of the magnetic field. Nevertheless, we search for potential signatures of varying grain alignment and dust properties. First, we analyse the product map $S \times p$, looking for residual trends. While $p$ decreases by a factor of 3--4 between $N\_H=10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $N\_H=2\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, $S \times p$ decreases by only about 25\%, a systematic trend observed in both the diffuse ISM and molecular clouds. Second, we find no systematic trend of $S \times p$ with the dust temperature, even though in the diffuse ISM lines of sight with high $p$ and low $S$ tend to have colder dust. We also compare Planck data with starlight polarization in the visible at high latitudes. The agreement in polarization angles is remarkable. Two polarization emission-to-extinction ratios that characterize dust optical properties depend only weakly on $N\_H$ and converge towards the values previously determined for translucent lines of sight. We determine an upper limit for the polarization fraction in extinction of 13\%, compatible with the $p\_\mathrm{max}$ observed in emission. These results provide strong constraints for models of Galactic dust in diffuse gas.},

  abstract      = {The FUGIN CO survey with the Nobeyama 45-m Telescope revealed the 3D structure of a galactic shock wave in the tangential direction of the 4-kpc molecular arm. The shock front is located at G30.5+00.0+95 km/s on the up-stream (lower longitude) side of the star-forming complex W43 (G30.8-0.03), and composes a molecular bow shock (MBS) concave to W43, exhibiting an arc-shaped molecular ridge perpendicular to the galactic plane with width $\sim 0^\circ.1$ (10 pc) and vertical length $\sim 1^\circ \ (100\ {\rm pc})$. The MBS is coincident with the radio continuum bow of thermal origin, indicating association of ionized gas and similarity to a cometary bright-rimmed cloud. The up-stream edge of the bow is sharp with a growth width of $\sim 0.5$ pc indicative of shock front property. The velocity width is $\sim 10$ km/s, and the center velocity decreases by $\sim 15$ $\backslash$kms from bottom to top of the bow. The total mass of molecular gas in MBS is estimated to be $\sim 1.2\times 10^6 \lt\_\odot$ and ionized gas $\sim 2\times 10^4 M\_\odot$. The vertical disk thickness increases step like at the MBS by $\sim 2$ times from lower to upper longitude, which indicates hydraulic-jump in the gaseous disk. We argue that the MBS was formed by the galactic shock compression of an accelerated flow in the spiral-arm potential encountering the W43 molecular complex. A bow-shock theory can well reproduce the bow morphology. We argue that molecular bows are common in galactic shock waves not only in the Galaxy but also in galaxies, where MBS are associated with giant cometary HII regions. We also analyzed the HI data in the same region to obtain a map of HI optical depth and molecular fraction. We found a firm evidence of HI-to-H$\_{2}$ transition in the galactic shock as revealed by a sharp molecular front at the MBS front.},

  abstract    = {We undertake a critical and comprehensive comparison of the radial velocities and the main stellar atmospheric parameters for stars in common between the latest data releases from the APOGEE and the LAMOST surveys. There is a total of 42,420 dwarfs/giants stars in common between the APOGEE DR14 - LAMOST DR3 stellar catalogs. A comparison between the RVs shows an offset of 4.54 $\pm$ 0.03 km/s, with a dispersion of 5.8 km/s, in the sense that APOGEE RVs are larger. We observe a small offset in the Teff of about 13 K, with a scatter of 155 K. Small offset in [Fe/H] of about 0.06 dex together with a scatter of 0.13 dex is also observed. We notice that the largest offset between the surveys occurs in the surface gravities. Using only surface gravities in calibrated red giants from APOGEE DR14, where there are 24,074 stars in common, a deviation of 0.14 dex is found with substantial scatter. There are 17,482 red giant stars in common between APOGEE DR14 and those in LAMOST tied to APOGEE DR12 via the Cannon. There is generally good agreement between the two data-sets. However, we find dependencies of the differences of the stellar parameters on effective temperature. For metal-rich stars, a different trend for the [Fe/H] discrepancies is found. Surprisingly, we see no correlation between the internal APOGEE DR14 - DR12 differences in Teff and those in DR14 - LAMOST tied to DR12, where a correlation should be expected since LAMOST has been calibrated to APOGEE DR12. We also find no correlation between the [Fe/H] discrepancies, suggesting that LAMOST/Cannon is not well coupled to the APOGEE DR12 stellar parameters scale. A [Fe/H] dependence between the stellar parameters in APOGEE DR12 and those in DR14 is reported. We find a weak correlation in the differences between APOGEE DR14 - DR12 and LAMOST on DR12 surface gravity for stars hotter than 4800 K and in the log g range between 2.0 and 2.8.},

  abstract = {This is the second paper in a series aimed at investigating the main sources of uncertainty in measuring the observable parameters in galaxies from their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). In the first paper we presented a detailed account of the photometric redshift measurements and an error analysis of this process. In this paper we perform a comprehensive study of the main sources of random and systematic error in stellar mass estimates for galaxies, and their relative contributions to the associated error budget. Since there is no prior knowledge of the stellar mass of galaxies (unlike their photometric redshifts), we use mock galaxy catalogs with simulated multi-waveband photometry and known redshift, stellar mass, age and extinction for individual galaxies. The multi-waveband photometry for the simulated galaxies were generated in 13 filters spanning from U -band to mid-infrared wavelengths. Given different parameters affecting stellar mass measurement (photometric signal-to-noise ratios (S/N), SED fitting errors and systematic effects), the inherent degeneracies and correlated errors, we formulated different simulated galaxy catalogs to quantify these effects individually. For comparison, we also generated catalogs based on observed photometric data of real galaxies in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-South field, spanning the same passbands. The simulated and observed catalogs were provided to a number of teams within the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey collaboration to estimate the stellar masses for individual galaxies. A total of 11 teams participated, with different combinations of stellar mass measurement codes/methods, population synthesis models, star formation histories, extinction and age. For each simulated galaxy, the differences between the input stellar masses, M input , and those estimated by each team, M est , is defined as ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/808/1/101/apj515559ieqn1.gif] {${\rm{\Delta }}\mathrm{log}(M)\equiv \mathrm{log}({M}_{\mathrm{estimated}})-\mathrm{log}({M}_{\mathrm{input}})$} , and used to identify the most fundamental parameters affecting stellar mass estimate in galaxies, with the following results. (1) No significant bias in Δ log( M ) was found among different codes, with all having comparable scatter ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/808/1/101/apj515559ieqn2.gif] {$\sigma ({\rm{\Delta }}\mathrm{log}(M))=0.136$} dex). The estimated stellar mass values are seriously affected by low photometric S/N, with the rms scatter increasing for galaxies with ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/808/1/101/apj515559ieqn3.gif] {${H}_{\mathrm{AB}}\gt 26$} mag; (2) A source of error contributing to the scatter in Δ log( M ) is found to be due to photometric uncertainties (0.136 dex) and low resolution in age and extinction grids when generating the SED templates; (3) The median of stellar masses among different methods provides a stable measure of the mass associated with any given galaxy ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/808/1/101/apj515559ieqn4.gif] {$\sigma ({\rm{\Delta }}\mathrm{log}(M))=0.142$} dex); (4) The Δ log( M ) values are strongly correlated with deviations in age (defined as the difference between the estimated and expected values), with a weaker correlation with extinction; (5) The rms scatter in the estimated stellar masses due to free parameters (after fixing redshifts and initial mass function) are quantified and found to be ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/808/1/101/apj515559ieqn5.gif] {$\sigma ({\rm{\Delta }}\mathrm{log}(M))=0.110$} dex; (6) Using the observed data, we studied the sensitivity of stellar masses to both the population synthesis codes and inclusion of nebular emission lines and found them to affect the stellar mass by 0.2 and 0.3 dex respectively.},

The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) is the next generation radio observatory and consists of two telescopes, one comprised of dishes operating at mid frequencies (SKA1-MID) and located in South Africa, and the other comprised of Log-Periodic antennas operating at low radio frequencies (SKA1-LOW), which will be located in Australia (Braun et al. 2017). The scientific commissioning of the radio telescope is planned to begin in 2021-2022. The SKA-Athena Synergy Team (SAST) has been tasked to single out the potential scientific synergies between Athena and SKA. The astrophysical community was involved in this exercise primarily through a dedicated SKA-Athena Synergy Workshop, which took place on April 24-25, 2017 at SKAO, Jodrell Bank, Manchester. The final result of the synergy exercise, this White Paper, describes in detail a number of scientific opportunities that will be opened up by the combination of Athena and SKA, these include: 1. the Cosmic Dawn; 2. the Evolution of black holes and galaxies; 3. Active galaxy feedback in galaxy clusters; 4. Non-thermal phenomena in galaxy clusters; 5. Detecting the cosmic web; 6. Black-hole accretion physics and astrophysical transients; 7.

  abstract      = {In this paper, we investigate the physical associations between blended far-infrared (FIR)-emitting galaxies, in order to identify the level of line-of-sight projection contamination in the single-dish Herschel data. Building on previous work, and as part of the Herschel Extragalactic Legacy Project (HELP), we identify a sample of galaxies in the COSMOS field which are found to be both FIR-bright (typically $\sim 15$ mJy) and blended within the Herschel 250 $\mu$m beam. We identify a spectroscopic or photometric redshift for each FIR-bright source. We conduct a joint probability distribution analysis on the redshift probability density functions to determine the fraction of the FIR sources with multiple FIR-bright counterparts which are likely to be found at consistent ($\Delta z$ $\lt 0.01$) redshifts. We find that only 3 (0.4 per cent) of the pair permutations between counterparts are $\gt50$ per cent likely to be at consistent redshifts. A majority of counterparts (72 per cent) have no overlap in their redshift probability distributions whatsoever. This is in good agreement with the results of recent simulations, which indicate that single-dish observations of the FIR sky should be strongly contaminated by line of sight projection effects. We conclude that for our sample of 3.6- and 24-$\mu$m selected, FIR-bright objects in the COSMOS field, the overwhelming majority of multi-component FIR systems are line of sight projections within the 18.1 arcsec Herschel beam, rather than physical associations.},

We describe how using The Cannon in a mode that restricts the abundance analysis of each element to regions of the spectrum with known features from that element leads to Cannon abundances can lead to significantly different results for some elements than when all regions of the spectrum are used to derive abundances.},

These include high resolution H-band spectra, radial velocities, and derived stellar parameters and abundances. DR13, released in August 2016, contained APOGEE data for roughly 150,000 stars, and DR14, released in August 2017, added about 110,000 more. Stellar parameters and abundances have been derived with an automated pipeline, the APOGEE Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundance Pipeline (ASPCAP). We evaluate the performance of this pipeline by comparing the derived stellar parameters and abundances to those inferred from optical spectra and analysis for several hundred stars. For most elements -- C, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Cr, Mn, Ni -- the DR14 ASPCAP analysis have systematic differences with the comparisons samples of less than 0.05 dex (median), and random differences of less than 0.15 dex (standard deviation). These differences are a combination of the uncertainties in both the comparison samples as well as the ASPCAP-analysis. Compared to the references, magnesium is the most accurate alpha-element derived by ASPCAP, and shows a very clear thin/thick disk separation, while nickel is the most accurate iron-peak element (besides iron).},

  title       = {A catalogue of structural and morphological measurements for DES Y1},
  abstract    = {We present a structural and morphological catalogue for 45 million objects selected from the first year of data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). Single Sersic fits and non-parametric measurements are produced for g, r and i filters. The parameters from the best-fitting Sersic model (total magnitude, half-light radius, Sersic index, axis ratio and position angle) are measured with Galfit; the non-parametric coefficients (concentration, asymmetry, clumpiness, Gini, M20) are provided using the Zurich Estimator of Structural Types (ZEST+). To study the statistical uncertainties, we consider a sample of state-of-the-art image simulations with a realistic distribution in the input parameter space and then process and analyse them as we do with real data: this enables us to quantify the observational biases due to PSF blurring and magnitude effects and correct the measurements as a function of magnitude, galaxy size, Sersic index (concentration for the analysis of the non-parametric measurements) and ellipticity. We present the largest structural catalogue to date: we find that accurate and complete measurements for all the structural parameters are typically obtained for galaxies with SExtractor MAG AUTO I < 21. Indeed, the parameters in the filters i and r can be overall well recovered up to MAG AUTO < 21.5, corresponding to a fitting completeness of ~90% below this threshold, for a total of 25 million galaxies. The combination of parametric and non-parametric structural measurements makes this catalogue an important instrument to explore and understand how galaxies form and evolve. The catalogue described in this paper will be publicly released alongside the Dark Energy Survey collaboration Y1 cosmology data products at the following URL: https://des.ncsa.illinois.edu/releases.},

  abstract      = {This paper uses radial colour profiles to infer the distributions of dust, gas and star formation in z = 0.4-1.4 star-forming main-sequence galaxies. We start with the standard UVJ-based method to estimate dust extinction and specific star formation rate (sSFR). By replacing J with I band, a new calibration method suitable for use with ACS+WFC3 data is created (I.e. UVI diagram). Using a multi-wavelength multi-aperture photometry catalogue based on CANDELS (Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey), UVI colour profiles of 1328 galaxies are stacked in stellar mass and redshift bins. The resulting colour gradients, covering a radial range of 0.2-2.0 effective radii, increase strongly with galaxy mass and with global A$_{V}$. Colour gradient directions are nearly parallel to the Calzetti extinction vector, indicating that dust plays a more important role than stellar population variations. With our calibration, the resulting A$_{V}$ profiles fall much more slowly than stellar mass profiles over the measured radial range. sSFR gradients are nearly flat without central quenching signatures, except for M$_{⋆}$ $\gt$ 10$^{10.5}$ M$_{⊙}$, where central declines of 20-25 per cent are observed. Both sets of profiles agree well with previous radial sSFR and (continuum) A$_{V}$ measurements. They are also consistent with the sSFR profiles and, if assuming a radially constant gas-to-dust ratio, gas profiles in recent hydrodynamic models. We finally discuss the striking findings that SFR scales with stellar mass density in the inner parts of galaxies, and that dust content is high in the outer parts despite low stellar mass surface densities there.},

  abstract      = {We study the spatially resolved star formation of 1494 galaxies in the SDSS-IV MaNGA Survey. Star formation rates (SFRs) are calculated using a two-step process, using H {$\alpha$} in star-forming regions and D$_{n}$4000 in regions identified as active galactic nucleus/low-ionization (nuclear) emission region [AGN/LI(N)ER] or lineless. The roles of secular and environmental quenching processes are investigated by studying the dependence of the radial profiles of specific star formation rate on stellar mass, galaxy structure, and environment. We report on the existence of `centrally suppressed' galaxies, which have suppressed Specific Star Formation Rate (SSFR) in their cores compared to their discs. The profiles of centrally suppressed and unsuppressed galaxies are distributed in a bimodal way. Galaxies with high stellar mass and core velocity dispersion are found to be much more likely to be centrally suppressed than low-mass galaxies, and we show that this is related to morphology and the presence of AGN/LI(N)ER like emission. Centrally suppressed galaxies also display lower star formation at all radii compared to unsuppressed galaxies. The profiles of central and satellite galaxies are also compared, and we find that satellite galaxies experience lower specific star formation rates at all radii than central galaxies. This uniform suppression could be a signal of the stripping of hot halo gas in the process known as strangulation. We find that satellites are not more likely to be suppressed in their cores than centrals, indicating that the core suppression is an entirely internal process. We find no correlation between the local environment density and the profiles of star formation rate surface density.},

Even within the star-forming `main sequence', the measured sSFR decreases with stellar mass, in both an integrated and spatially resolved sense. Flat sSFR radial profiles are observed for log(M$_{⋆}$/M$_{⊙}$) $\lt$ 10.5, while star-forming galaxies of higher mass show a significant decrease in sSFR in the central regions, a likely consequence of both larger bulges and an inside-out growth history. Our primary focus is the green valley, constituted by galaxies lying below the star formation main sequence, but not fully passive. In the green valley we find sSFR profiles that are suppressed with respect to star-forming galaxies of the same mass at all galactocentric distances out to 2 effective radii. The responsible quenching mechanism therefore appears to affect the entire galaxy, not simply an expanding central region. The majority of green valley galaxies of log(M$_{⋆}$/M$_{⊙}$) $\gt$ 10.0 are classified spectroscopically as central low-ionization emission-line regions (cLIERs). Despite displaying a higher central stellar mass concentration, the sSFR suppression observed in cLIER galaxies is not simply due to the larger mass of the bulge. Drawing a comparison sample of star-forming galaxies with the same M$_{⋆}$ and {$\Sigma$} \_$\{$1 kpc$\}$ (the mass surface density within 1 kpc), we show that a high {$\Sigma$} \_$\{$1 kpc$\}$ is not a sufficient condition for determining central quiescence.},

  abstract      = {Several models have predicted that stars could form inside galactic outflows and that this would be a new major mode of galaxy evolution. Observations of galactic outflows have revealed that they host large amounts of dense and clumpy molecular gas, which provide conditions suitable for star formation. We have investigated the properties of the outflows in a large sample of galaxies by exploiting the integral field spectroscopic data of the large MaNGA-SDSS4 galaxy survey. We find that star formation occurs inside at least half of the galactic outflows in our sample. We also show that even if star formation is prominent inside many other galactic outflows, this may have not been revealed as the diagnostics are easily dominated by the presence of even faint AGN and shocks. If very massive outflows typical of distant galaxies and quasars follow the same scaling relations observed locally, then the star formation inside high-z outflows can be up to several 100 Msun/yr and could contribute substantially to the early formation of the spheroidal component of galaxies. Star formation in outflows can also potentially contribute to establishing the scaling relations between black holes and their host spheroids. Moreover, supernovae exploding on large orbits can chemically enrich in-situ and heat the circumgalactic and intergalactic medium. Finally, young stars ejected on large orbits may also contribute to the reionization of the Universe.},

Our analysis serves as a first illustration of the power of high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio continuum spectroscopy at intermediate redshifts as a qualitatively new tool to constrain galaxy formation models. The observed D$_{ n }$4000{\ndash}EW(H{$\delta$}) distribution of our sample overlaps with the distribution traced by present-day galaxies, but z {\sim} 0.8 galaxies populate that locus in a fundamentally different manner. While old galaxies dominate the present-day population at all stellar masses $\gt$2 {\times} 10$^{10}$ M $_{⊙}$, we see a bimodal D$_{ n }$4000{\ndash}EW(H{$\delta$}) distribution at z {\sim} 0.8, implying a bimodal light-weighted age distribution. The light-weighted age depends strongly on stellar mass, with the most massive galaxies $\gt$1 {\times} 10$^{11}$ M $_{⊙}$ being almost all older than 2 Gyr. At the same time, we estimate that galaxies in this high-mass range are only {\sim}3 Gyr younger than their z {\sim} 0.1 counterparts, at odds with purely passive evolution given a difference in look-back time of $\gt$5 Gyr; younger galaxies must grow to $\gt$10$^{11}$ M $_{⊙}$ in the meantime, or small amounts of young stars must keep the light-weighted ages young. Star-forming galaxies at z {\sim} 0.8 have stronger H{$\delta$} absorption than present-day galaxies with the same D$_{ n }$4000, implying larger short-term variations in star formation activity.},

The two brightest sources correspond to a known single-dish (AzTEC) selected bright submillimeter galaxy (SMG), whereas the remaining three are faint SMGs newly uncovered by ALMA. If we exclude the two brightest sources, the contribution of the ALMA-detected faint SMGs to the infrared extragalactic background light is estimated to be {\tilde} 4.1\^{}$\{$+5.4$\}$\_$\{$-3.0$\}$Jy deg$^{-2}$, which corresponds to {\tilde} 16\^{}$\{$+22$\}$\_$\{$-12$\}$\% of the infrared extragalactic background light. This suggests that their contribution to the infrared extragalactic background light is as large as that of bright SMGs. We identified multiwavelength counterparts of the five ALMA sources.

By fitting the spectral energy distributions at the optical-to-near-infrared wavelengths of the remaining four ALMA sources, we obtained the photometric redshifts (z$_{photo}$) and stellar masses (M$_{*}$): z$_{photo}$ {\sime} 1.3-2.5, M$_{*}$ {\sime} (3.5-9.5) {\times} 10$^{10}$ M$_{⊙}$. We also derived their star formation rates (SFRs) and specific SFRs as {\sime}30-200 M$_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$ and {\sime}0.8-2 Gyr$^{-1}$, respectively.

We find that galaxies that are brighter in the rest-frame near-infrared tend to also be brighter at 1.1 mm, and galaxies fainter than {m}3.6μ {{m}}=23 do not produce detectable 1.1 mm emission. This suggests a correlation between stellar mass and SFR, but outliers to this correlation are also observed, suggesting strongly boosted star formation or extremely large extinction. We also find tendencies that redder galaxies and galaxies at higher redshifts are brighter at 1.1 mm. Our field contains z̃ 2.5 Hα emitters and a bright single-dish source. However, we do not find evidence of bias in our results caused by the bright source. By combining the fluxes of sources detected by ALMA and fluxes of faint sources detected with stacking, we recover a 1.1 mm surface brightness of up to 20.3 ± 1.2 Jy deg-2, comparable to the extragalactic background light measured by COBE. Based on the fractions of optically faint sources in our and previous ALMA studies and the COBE measurements, we find that approximately half of the cosmic star formation may be obscured by dust and missed by deep optical surveys. Much deeper and wider ALMA imaging is therefore needed to better constrain the obscured cosmic star formation history.},

We will resolve molecular gas contents and dusty star formation within these galaxies, and tell whether clumps are formed by gravitational instability of gas rich disks, and whether bulges are formed by clump migration or through galaxy-galaxy mergers.},

The sample we have analyzed in this paper is composed of 96 galaxies observed with ALMA at 890 {$\mu$}m (180 {$\mu$}m rest-frame) with an on-source integration time of 1.3 min per galaxy. We detected 32\% of the sample at more than 3{$\sigma$} significance. Using the stacked ALMA and Herschel photometry, we derived an average dust temperature of 40 {\plusmn} 2 K for the whole sample, and extrapolate the L$_{IR}$ and SFR for all our galaxies based on their ALMA flux. We then used a forward modeling approach to estimate their intrinsic sSFR distribution, deconvolved of measurement errors and selection effects: we find a linear relation between SFR and M$_{∗}$, with a median sSFR = 2.8 {\plusmn} 0.8 Gyr and a dispersion around that relation of 0.28 {\plusmn} 0.13 dex. This latter value is consistent with that measured at lower redshifts, which is proof that the main sequence of star-forming galaxies was already in place at z = 4, at least among massive galaxies. These new constraints on the properties of the main sequence are in good agreement with the latest predictions from numerical simulations, and suggest that the bulk of star formation in galaxies is driven by the same mechanism from z = 4 to the present day, that is, over at least 90\% of the cosmic history. We also discuss the consequences of our results on the population of early quiescent galaxies. This paper is part of a series that will employ these new ALMA observations to explore the star formation and dust properties of the massive end of the z = 4 galaxy population.},

  abstract      = {We present the results of CANDELSz7, an ESO large program aimed at confirming spectroscopically a homogeneous sample of z\~{}6 and z\~{}7 star forming galaxies. The candidates were selected in the GOODS-South, UDS and COSMOS fields using the official CANDELS catalogs based on H160-band detections. Standard color criteria, which were tailored depending on the ancillary multi-wavelength data available for each field, were applied to select more than 160 candidate galaxies at z\~{}6 and z\~{}7. Deep medium resolution FORS2 spectroscopic observations were then conducted with integration times ranging from 12 to 20 hours, to reach a Lyalpha flux limit of approximately 1-3x 10-18 erg/s/cm\^{}2 at 3sigma. For about 40\% of the galaxies we could determine a spectroscopic redshift, mainly through the detection of a single emission line that we interpret as Lyalpha emission, or for some of the brightest objects (H160$\lt$ 25.5) from the presence of faint continuum and sharp drop that we interpret as a Lyman break. In this paper we present the redshifts and main properties of 65 newly confirmed high redshift galaxies. Adding previous proprietary and archival data we assemble a sample of \~{}260 galaxies that we use to explore the evolution of the Lyalpha fraction in Lyman break galaxies and the change in the shape of the emission line between z\~{}6 and z\~{}7. We also discuss the accuracy of the CANDELS photometric redshifts in this redshift range.},

Galaxies included have a redshift range 0.004 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 0.113 and a large stellar mass range 7.5 $\lt$ log (M\_star/M\_sun) $\lt$ 11.6. The core data for each galaxy consist of two primary spectral cubes covering the blue and red optical wavelength ranges. For each primary cube we also provide three spatially binned spectral cubes and a set of standardised aperture spectra. For each core data product we provide a set of value-added data products. This includes all emission line value-added products from Data Release One, expanded to the larger sample. In addition we include stellar kinematic and stellar population value-added products derived from absorption line measurements. The data are provided online through Australian Astronomical Optics' Data Central. We illustrate the potential of this release by presenting the distribution of \~{}350,000 stellar velocity dispersion measurements from individual spaxels as a function of R/R\_e, divided in four galaxy mass bins. In the highest stellar mass bin (log (M\_star/M\_sun)$\gt$11), the velocity dispersion strongly increases towards the centre, whereas below log (M\_star/M\_sun)$\lt$10 we find no evidence for a clear increase in the central velocity dispersion. This suggests a transition mass around log (M\_star/M\_sun) \~{}10 for galaxies with or without a dispersion-dominated bulge.},

One critical aspect of this work is that multi-messenger binary black hole studies may be possible with the ngVLA when combined with gravitational-wave searches using pulsar timing array techniques. However, long-baseline interferometery ($\gt$$\gt$1000 km) will make this possibility more likely by expanding the redshift range at which radio emission arising from two separate black holes may be resolved and studied.},

The main goal of COLDz is to constrain the cosmic density of molecular gas at the peak epoch of cosmic star formation. By targeting both a wide ($\sim$51 arcmin$^2$) and a deep area ($\sim$9 arcmin$^2$), the survey is designed to robustly constrain the bright end and the characteristic luminosity of the CO(1-0) luminosity function. An extensive analysis of the reliability of our line candidates, and new techniques provide detailed completeness and statistical corrections as necessary to determine the best constraints to date on the CO luminosity function. Our blind search for CO(1-0) uniformly selects starbursts and massive Main Sequence galaxies based on their cold molecular gas masses. Our search also detects CO(2-1) line emission from optically dark, dusty star-forming galaxies at $z\gt5$. We find a range of spatial sizes for the CO-traced gas reservoirs up to $\sim40$ kpc, suggesting that spatially extended cold molecular gas reservoirs may be common in massive, gas-rich galaxies at $z\sim2$. Through CO line stacking, we constrain the gas mass fraction in previously known typical star-forming galaxies at $z=2$-3. The stacked CO detection suggests lower molecular gas mass fractions than expected for massive Main Sequence galaxies by a factor of $\sim3-6$. We find total CO line brightness at $\sim34\,$GHz of $0.45\pm0.2\,\mu$K, which constrains future line intensity mapping and CMB experiments.},

The survey comprises 456 individual WFC3 pointings corresponding to an area of 0.49 deg\^{}2 (0.66 deg\^{}2 when including archival data) and reaches a 5 point-source limit of H\_160 =25.1 (0``.3 aperture). COSMOS-DASH is the widest HST/WFC3 imaging survey in H\_160 filter, tripling the extragalactic survey area in the near-infrared at HST resolution. We make the reduced H\_160 mosaic available to the community. We use this dataset to measure the sizes of 162 galaxies with log(M\_star/M\_sun) $\gt$ 11.3 at 1.5 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3.0, and augment this sample with 748 galaxies at 0.1 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1.5 using archival ACS imaging. We find that the median size of galaxies in this mass range changes with redshift as r\_eff = (10.4+/-0.4)(1 +z)\^{}(0.65+/-0.05) kpc. Separating the galaxies into star forming and quiescent galaxies using their restframe U-V and V-J colors, we find no statistical difference between the median sizes of the most massive star-forming and quiescent galaxies at z = 2.5: they are 4.9+/-0.9 kpc and 4.3 +/-0.3 kpc respectively. However, we do find a significant difference in the S`ersic index between the two samples, such that massive quiescent galaxies have higher central densities than star forming galaxies. We extend the size-mass analysis to lower masses by combining it with the 3D-HST/CANDELS sample of van der Wel et al. (2014), and derive empirical relations between size, mass, and redshift. Fitting a relation of the form r\_eff = A m\_star\^{}a, m\_star = M\_star/5x10\^{}10 M\_sun and r\_eff in kpc, we find log A = -0.25 log (1 + z) + 0.79 and a = -0.13 log(1 + z) + 0.27. We also provide relations for the subsamples of star forming and quiescent galaxies. Our results confirm previous studies that were based on smaller samples or ground-based imaging.},

ASAGAO is a deep (1sigma ~ 61 uJy/beam for a 250 klambda-tapered map with a synthesized beam size of 0.51" x 0.45") and wide area (26 arcmin^2) survey on a contiguous field at 1.2 mm. By combining with ALMA archival data in the GOODS-South field, we obtained a deeper map in the same region (1sigma ~ 30 uJy/beam for a deep region with a 250 klambda-taper, and a synthesized beam size of 0.59" x 0.53"), providing the largest sample of sources (25 sources at >=5.0sigma, 45 sources at >=4.5sigma) among ALMA blank-field surveys to date. The number counts shows that 52(+11 -8)% of the extragalactic background light at 1.2 mm is resolved into discrete sources at S1.2m > 135 uJy. We create infrared (IR) luminosity functions (LFs) in the redshift range of z = 1-3 from the ASAGAO sources with KS-band counterparts, and constrain the faintest luminosity of the LF at 2.0 < z < 3.0. The LFs are consistent with previous results based on other ALMA and SCUBA-2 observations, which suggest a positive luminosity evolution and negative density evolution with increasing redshift. We find that obscured star-formation of sources with IR luminosities of log(L(IR)/Lsun) ~> 11.8 account for ~~60%-90% of the z ~ 2 cosmic star-formation rate density. },

  abstract      = {Deep MIR surveys have revealed numerous strongly star-forming galaxies at redshift z\~{}$\lt$2. Their MIR fluxes are produced by a combination of continuum and PAH emission features. The PAH features can dominate the total MIR flux, but are difficult to measure without spectroscopy. We aim to study star-forming galaxies by using a blind spectroscopic survey at MIR wavelengths to understand evolution of their star formation rate (SFR) and specific SFR up to z\~{}=0.5, by paying particular attention to their PAH properties. We conducted a low-resolution (R\~{}=50) slitless spectroscopic survey at 5-13um of 9um flux-selected sources ($\gt$0.3 mJy) around the North Ecliptic Pole with the Infrared Camera (IRC) onboard AKARI. After removing 11 AGN candidates by using the IRC photometry, we identified 48 PAH galaxies with PAH 6.2, 7.7, and 8.6um features at z$\lt$0.5. The rest-frame optical-MIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) based on CFHT and AKARI/IRC imaging covering 0.37-18um were produced, and analysed in conjunction with the PAH spectroscopy. We defined the PAH enhancement by using the luminosity ratio of the 7.7um PAH feature over the 3.5um stellar component of the SEDs. The rest-frame SEDs of all PAH galaxies have a universal shape with stellar and 7.7um bumps, except that the PAH enhancement significantly varies as a function of the PAH luminosities. We identified a PAH-enhanced population at z\~{}$\gt$0.35, whose SEDs and luminosities are typical of luminous infrared galaxies. They show particularly larger PAH enhancement at high luminosity, implying that they are vigorous star-forming galaxies with elevated specific SFR. Our composite starburst model that combines a very young and optically very thick starburst with a very old population can successfully reproduce most of their SED characteristics, although we could not confirm this optically thick component from our spectral analysis.},

  abstract      = {Context. The XMM-XXL survey uses observations from XMM-Newton to detect clusters of galaxies over a wide range in mass and redshift. The moderate PSF of XMM-Newton means that point sources within or projected onto a cluster may not be separated from the cluster emission, leading to enhanced luminosities and affecting the selection function of the cluster survey. Aims. We present the results of short Chandra observations of 21 galaxy clusters and cluster candidates at redshifts z $\gt$ 1 detected in the XMM-XXL survey in X-rays or selected in the optical and infra-red. Methods. With the superior angular resolution of Chandra we investigate whether there are any point sources within the cluster region that were not detected by the XMM-XXL analysis pipeline, and whether any point sources were misclassified as distant clusters. Results. Of the 14 X-ray selected clusters, nine are free from significant point source contamination, either having no previously unresolved sources detected by Chandra, or with less than about 10\% of the reported XXL cluster flux being resolved into point sources. Of the other five sources, one is significantly contaminated by previously unresolved AGN, and four appear to be AGN misclassified as clusters. All but one of these cases are in the subset of less secure X-ray selected cluster detections and the false positive rate is consistent with that expected from the XXL selection function modelling. We also considered a further seven optically-selected cluster candidates associated with faint XXL sources that were not classed as clusters. By decontaminating and vetting these distant clusters, we provide a pure sample of clusters at redshift z $\gt$ 1 for deeper follow-up observations, and demonstrate the utility of using Chandra snapshots to test for AGN in surveys with high sensitivity but poor angular resolution.},

  abstract      = {The primary goals of the STRong lensing Insights into the Dark Energy Survey (STRIDES) collaboration are to measure the dark energy equation of state parameter and the free streaming length of dark matter. To this aim, STRIDES is discovering strongly lensed quasars in the imaging data of the Dark Energy Survey and following them up to measure time delays, high resolution imaging, and spectroscopy sufficient to construct accurate lens models. In this paper, we first present forecasts for STRIDES. Then, we describe the STRIDES classification scheme, and give an overview of the Fall 2016 follow-up campaign. We continue by detailing the results of two selection methods, the Outlier Selection Technique and a morphological algorithm, and presenting lens models of a system, which could possibly be a lensed quasar in an unusual configuration. We conclude with the summary statistics of the Fall 2016 campaign. Including searches presented in companion papers (Anguita et al.; Ostrovski et al.), STRIDES followed up 117 targets identifying 7 new strongly lensed systems, and 7 nearly identical quasars (NIQs), which could be confirmed as lenses by the detection of the lens galaxy. 76 candidates were rejected and 27 remain otherwise inconclusive, for a success rate in the range 6-35$\backslash$\%. This rate is comparable to that of previous searches like SQLS even though the parent dataset of STRIDES is purely photometric and our selection of candidates cannot rely on spectroscopic information.},

  abstract      = {Star-forming galaxies have been found to follow a relatively tight relation between stellar mass ($M\_{*}$) and star formation rate (SFR), dubbed the `star formation sequence'. A turnover in the sequence has been observed, where galaxies with $M\_{*} \lt 10^{10} {\rm M}\_{\odot}$ follow a steeper relation than their higher mass counterparts, suggesting that the low-mass slope is (nearly) linear. In this paper, we characterise the properties of the low-mass end of the star formation sequence between $7 \leq \log M\_{*}[{\rm M}\_{\odot}] \leq 10.5$ at redshift $0.11 \lt z \lt 0.91$. We use the deepest MUSE observations of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field and the Hubble Deep Field South to construct a sample of 179 star-forming galaxies with high signal-to-noise emission lines. Dust-corrected SFRs are determined from H$\beta$ $\lambda 4861$ and H$\alpha$ $\lambda 6563$. We model the star formation sequence with a Gaussian distribution around a hyperplane between $\log M\_{*}$, $\log {\rm SFR}$, and $\log (1+z)$, to simultaneously constrain the slope, redshift evolution, and intrinsic scatter. We find a sub-linear slope for the low-mass regime where $\log {\rm SFR}[{\rm M}\_{\odot}/{\rm yr}] = 0.83^{+0.07}\_{-0.06} \log M\_{*}[{\rm M}\_{\odot}] + 1.74^{+0.66}\_{-0.68} \log (1+z)$, increasing with redshift. We recover an intrinsic scatter in the relation of $\sigma\_{\rm intr} = 0.44^{+0.05}\_{-0.04}$ dex, larger than typically found at higher masses. As both hydrodynamical simulations and (semi-)analytical models typically favour a steeper slope in the low-mass regime, our results provide new constraints on the feedback processes which operate preferentially in low-mass halos.},

  abstract      = {We have analyzed the differences in positions of 9081 matching sources between the Gaia DR2 and VLBI catalogues. The median position uncertainty of matching sources in the VLBI catalogue is a factor of two larger than the median position uncertainty in the Gaia DR2. There are 9\% matching sources with statistically significant offsets between two catalogues. We found that reported positional errors should be re-scaled by a factor of 1.3 for VLBI and 1.06 for Gaia, and in addition, Gaia errors should be multiplied by the square root of chi square per degree of freedom in order to best fit the normalized position differences to the Rayleigh distribution. We have established that the major contributor to statistically significant position offsets is the presence of optical jets. Among the sources for which the jet direction was determined, the position offsets are parallel to the jet directions for 62\% of the outliers. Among the matching sources with significant proper motion, the fraction of objects with proper motion directions parallel to jets is a factor of 3 greater. Such sources have systematically higher chi square per degree of freedom. We explain these proper motions as a manifestation of the source position jitter caused by flares that we have predicted earlier. Therefore, the assumption that quasars are fixed points and therefore, differential proper motions determined with respect to quasar photocenters can be regarded as absolute proper motions, should be treated with a great caution.},

Including new {{YJHK}}{{s}} images from the UltraVISTA-DR2 survey, Y-band images from Subaru/Hyper-Suprime-Cam, and infrared data from the Spitzer Large Area Survey with the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Spitzer legacy program, this near-infrared-selected catalog is highly optimized for the study of galaxy evolution and environments in the early universe. To maximize catalog completeness for bluer objects and at higher redshifts, objects have been detected on a χ 2 sum of the {{YJHK}}{{s}} and z ++ images. The catalog contains ˜ 6× {10}5 objects in the 1.5 deg2 UltraVISTA-DR2 region and ˜ 1.5× {10}5 objects are detected in the “ultra-deep stripes” (0.62 deg2) at {K}{{s}}≤slant 24.7 (3σ, 3″, AB magnitude). Through a comparison with the zCOSMOS-bright spectroscopic redshifts, we measure a photometric redshift precision of {σ }{{Δ }z/(1+{z}s)} = 0.007 and a catastrophic failure fraction of η = 0.5%. At 3\lt z\lt 6, using the unique database of spectroscopic redshifts in COSMOS, we find {σ }{{Δ }z/(1+{z}s)} = 0.021 and η = 13.2 % . The deepest regions reach a 90% completeness limit of {10}10{M}⊙ to z = 4. Detailed comparisons of the color distributions, number counts, and clustering show excellent agreement with the literature in the same mass ranges. COSMOS2015 represents a unique, publicly available, valuable resource with which to investigate the evolution of galaxies within their environment back to the earliest stages of the history of the universe.

Our main aim is to determine the metallicity distribution of these absorbers. Our sample consists of 224 absorbers selected on the basis of their HI absorption strength. Here we discuss the properties of our survey and the immediate empirical results. We find singly and doubly ionized metal species and HI typically have similar velocity profiles, implying they probe gas in the same or similar environments. The column density ionic ratios (e.g., CII/CIII, OI/CII) indicate the gas in these absorbers is largely ionized, and the ionization conditions are quite comparable across the sampled N(HI) range. The Doppler parameters of the HI imply T$\lt$50,000 K on average, consistent with the gas being photoionized. The MgII column densities span $\gt$2 orders of magnitude at any given N(HI), indicating a wide range of metallicities (from solar to $\lt$1/100 solar). In the range 16.2$\lt$log N(HI)$\lt$17, there is a gap in the N(MgII) distribution corresponding to gas with \~{}10\% solar metallicity, consistent with the gap seen in the previously identified bimodal metallicity distribution in this column density regime. Less than 3\% of the absorbers in our sample show no detectable metal absorption, implying truly-pristine gas at z$\lt$1 is uncommon. We find [FeII/MgII] = -0.4+/-0.3, and since alpha-enhancement can affect this ratio, dust depletion is extremely mild.},

  abstract      = {We present the first results from the GeMS/GSAOI Galactic Globular Cluster Survey (G4CS) of the Milky-Way globular clusters (GCs) NGC 3201 and NGC 2298. Using the Gemini South Adaptive Optics Imager (GSAOI), in tandem with the Gemini Multi-conjugate adaptive optics System (GeMS) on the 8.1-meter Gemini-South telescope, we collected deep near-IR observations of both clusters, resolving their constituent stellar populations down to $K\_s\simeq21$ Vega mag. Point spread function (PSF) photometry was performed on the data using spatially-variable PSFs to generate $JHK\_{s}$ photometric catalogues for both clusters. These catalogues were combined with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data to augment the photometric wavelength coverage, yielding catalogues that span the near-ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (near-IR). We then applied 0.14 mas/year accurate proper-motion cleaning, differential-reddening corrections and chose to anchor our isochrones using the lower main-sequence knee (MSK) and the main-sequence turn-off (MSTO) prior to age determination. As a result of the data quality, we found that the $K\_{s}$ vs. F606W$-K\_{s}$ and F336W vs. F336W$-K\_{s}$ color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) were the most diagnostically powerful. We used these two color combinations to derive the stellar-population ages, distances and reddening values for both clusters. Following isochrone-fitting using three different isochrone sets, we derived best-fit absolute ages of $12.2\pm0.5$ Gyr and $13.2\pm0.4$ Gyr for NGC 3201 and NGC 2298, respectively. This was done using a weighted average over the two aforementioned color combinations, following a pseudo-$\chi^2$ determination of the best-fit isochrone set. Our derived parameters are in good agreement with recent age determinations of the two clusters, with our constraints on the ages being or ranking among the most statistically robust.},

  abstract      = {We present a new model to describe the galaxy-dark matter connection across cosmic time, which unlike the popular subhalo abundance-matching technique is self-consistent in that it takes account of the facts that (1) subhalos are accreted at different times and (2) the properties of satellite galaxies may evolve after accretion. Using observations of galaxy stellar mass functions (SMFs) out to z \~{} 4, the conditional SMF at z \~{} 0.1 obtained from Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxy group catalogs, and the two-point correlation function (2PCF) of galaxies at z \~{} 0.1 as a function of stellar mass, we constrain the relation between galaxies and dark matter halos over the entire cosmic history from z \~{} 4 to the present. This relation is then used to predict the median assembly histories of different stellar mass components within dark matter halos (central galaxies, satellite galaxies, and halo stars). We also make predictions for the 2PCFs of high-z galaxies as function of stellar mass. Our main findings are the following: (1) Our model reasonably fits all data within the observational uncertainties, indicating that the {$\Lambda$}CDM concordance cosmology is consistent with a wide variety of data regarding the galaxy population across cosmic time. (2) At low-z, the stellar mass of central galaxies increases with halo mass as M $^{0.3}$ and M $^{gsim 4.0}$ at the massive and low-mass ends, respectively. The ratio M $_{*, c }$/M reveals a maximum of \~{}0.03 at a halo mass M \~{} 10$^{11.8}$ h $^{-1}$ M $_{⊙}$, much lower than the universal baryon fraction (\~{}0.17). At higher redshifts the maximum in M $_{*, c }$/M remains close to \~{}0.03, but shifts to higher halo mass. (3) The inferred timescale for the disruption of satellite galaxies is about the same as the dynamical friction timescale of their subhalos. (4) The stellar mass assembly history of central galaxies is completely decoupled from the assembly history of its host halo; the ratio M $_{*, c }$/M initially increases rapidly with time until the halo mass reaches \~{}10$^{12}$ h $^{-1}$ M $_{⊙}$, at which point M $_{*, c }$/M \~{} 0.03. Once M $\gt$\~{} 10$^{12}$ h $^{-1}$ M $_{⊙}$, there is little growth in M $_{*, c }$, causing the ratio M $_{*, c }$/M to decline. In Milky Way (MW)-sized halos more than half of the central stellar mass is assembled at z $\lt$\~{} 0.5. (5) In low-mass halos, the accretion of satellite galaxies contributes little to the formation of their central galaxies, indicating that most of their stars must have formed in situ. In massive halos more than half of the stellar mass of the central galaxy has to be formed in situ, and the accretion of satellites can only become significant at z $\lt$\~{} 2. (6) The total mass in halo stars is more than twice that of the central galaxy in massive halos, but less than 10\% of M $_{*, c }$ in MW-sized halos. (7) The 2PCFs of galaxies on small scales hold important information regarding the evolution of satellite galaxies, which at high-z is predicted to be much steeper than at low-z, especially for more massive galaxies. We discuss various implications of our findings regarding the formation and evolution of galaxies in a {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology.},

  abstract      = {The PAU Survey (PAUS) is an innovative photometric survey with 40 narrow bands at the William Herschel Telescope (WHT). The narrow bands are spaced at 100$\backslash$AA$\backslash$ intervals covering the range 4500$\backslash$AA$\backslash$ to 8500$\backslash$AA$\backslash$ and, in combination with standard broad bands, enable excellent redshift precision. This paper describes the technique, galaxy templates and additional photometric calibration used to determine early photometric redshifts from PAUS. Using BCNz2, a new photometric redshift code developed for this purpose, we characterise the photometric redshift performance using PAUS data on the COSMOS field. Comparison to secure spectra from zCOSMOS DR3 shows that PAUS achieves $\sigma\_{68} /(1+z) = 0.0037$ to $i\_{\mathrm{AB}} \lt 22.5$ when selecting the best 50\% of the sources based on a photometric redshift quality cut. Furthermore, a higher photo-z precision ($\sigma\_{68}/(1+z) \sim 0.001$) is obtained for a bright and high quality selection, which is driven by the identification of emission lines. We conclude that PAUS meets its design goals, opening up a hitherto uncharted regime of deep, wide, and dense galaxy survey with precise redshifts that will provide unique insights into the formation, evolution and clustering of galaxies, as well as their intrinsic alignments.},

  abstract      = {The bulk of the X-ray emission in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is produced very close to the accreting supermassive black hole (SMBH), in a corona of hot electrons which up scatters optical and ultraviolet photons from the accretion flow. The cutoff energy ($E\_{\rm C}$) of the primary X-ray continuum emission carries important information on the physical characteristics of the X-ray emitting plasma, but little is currently known about its potential relation with the properties of accreting SMBHs. Using the largest broad-band (0.3-150 keV) X-ray spectroscopic study available to date, we investigate how the corona is related to the AGN luminosity, black hole mass and Eddington ratio ($\lambda\_{\rm Edd}$). Assuming a slab corona the median values of the temperature and optical depth of the Comptonizing plasma are $kT\_{\rm e}=105 \pm 18$ keV and $\tau=0.25\pm0.06$, respectively. When we properly account for the large number of $E\_{\rm C}$ lower limits, we find a statistically significant dependence of the cutoff energy on the Eddington ratio. In particular, objects with $ \lambda\_{\rm Edd}\gt0.1$ have a significantly lower median cutoff energy ($E\_{\rm C}=160\pm41$ keV) than those with $\lambda\_{\rm Edd}\leq 0.1$ ($E\_{\rm C}=370\pm51$ keV). This is consistent with the idea that radiatively compact coronae are also cooler, because they tend to avoid the region in the temperature-compactness parameter space where runaway pair production would dominate. We show that this behaviour could also straightforwardly explain the suggested positive correlation between the photon index ($\Gamma$) and the Eddington ratio, being able to reproduce the observed slope of the $\Gamma-\lambda\_{\rm Edd}$ trend.},

  abstract      = {We introduce the THE THREE HUNDRED project, an endeavour to model 324 large galaxy clusters with full-physics hydrodynamical re-simulations. Here we present the data set and study the differences to observations for fundamental galaxy cluster properties and scaling relations. We find that the modelled galaxy clusters are generally in reasonable agreement with observations with respect to baryonic fractions and gas scaling relations at redshift z = 0. However, there are still some (model-dependent) differences, such as central galaxies being too massive, and galaxy colours (g - r) being bluer (about 0.2 dex lower at the peak position) than in observations. The agreement in gas scaling relations down to 10\^{}$\{$13$\}$ h\^{}$\{$-1$\}$ M\_$\{$$\backslash$odot$\}$ between the simulations indicates that particulars of the sub-grid modelling of the baryonic physics only has a weak influence on these relations. We also include - where appropriate - a comparison to three semi-analytical galaxy formation models as applied to the same underlying dark-matter-only simulation. All simulations and derived data products are publicly available.},

  abstract      = {We present results from the LymAn Continuum Escape Survey (LACES), a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) program designed to characterize the ionizing radiation emerging from a sample of Lyman alpha emitting galaxies at redshift $z\simeq 3.1$. As many show intense [O III] emission characteristic of $z\gt6.5$ star-forming galaxies, they may represent valuable low redshift analogs of galaxies in the reionization era. Using HST Wide Field Camera 3 / UVIS $F336W$ to image Lyman continuum emission, we investigate the escape fraction of ionizing photons in this sample. For 61 sources, of which 77\% are spectroscopically confirmed and 53 have measures of [O III] emission, we detect Lyman continuum leakage in 30\%, a rate significantly higher than in continuum-selected Lyman break galaxies. We estimate there is a 97\% probability that $\leq 3$ of our detections could be affected by foreground contamination. Fitting multi-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to take account of the varying stellar populations, dust extinctions and metallicities, we derive individual Lyman continuum escape fractions corrected for foreground intergalactic absorption. We find escape fractions of 2 to 82\% for individual objects, and infer an average 20\% escape fraction by fitting composite SEDs for our detected samples. Surprisingly however, even a deep stack of those sources with no individual $F336W$ detections provides a stringent upper limit on the average escape fraction of less than 0.3\%. We examine various correlations with source properties and discuss the implications in the context of the popular picture that cosmic reionization is driven by such compact, low metallicity star-forming galaxies.},

  abstract      = {(Abridged) We describe here the most ambitious survey currently planned in the optical, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). A vast array of science will be enabled by a single wide-deep-fast sky survey, and LSST will have unique survey capability in the faint time domain. The LSST design is driven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a wide-field ground-based system sited at Cerro Pach$\backslash$'$\{$o$\}$n in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg$^2$ field of view, and a 3.2 Gigapixel camera. The standard observing sequence will consist of pairs of 15-second exposures in a given field, with two such visits in each pointing in a given night. With these repeats, the LSST system is capable of imaging about 10,000 square degrees of sky in a single filter in three nights. The typical 5$\sigma$ point-source depth in a single visit in $r$ will be $\sim 24.5$ (AB). The project is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations by 2022. The survey area will be contained within 30,000 deg$^2$ with $\delta\lt+34.5^\circ$, and will be imaged multiple times in six bands, $ugrizy$, covering the wavelength range 320--1050 nm. About 90$\backslash$\% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode which will uniformly observe a 18,000 deg$^2$ region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the anticipated 10 years of operations, and yield a coadded map to $r\sim27.5$. The remaining 10$\backslash$\% of the observing time will be allocated to projects such as a Very Deep and Fast time domain survey. The goal is to make LSST data products, including a relational database of about 32 trillion observations of 40 billion objects, available to the public and scientists around the world.},

We also release a catalog with spectroscopic redshifts, emission line fluxes, Lick/IDS indices, and observed stellar and gas velocity dispersions that are spatially integrated quantities including both rotational motions and genuine dispersion. To illustrate the new parameter space in the intermediate redshift regime probed by LEGA-C we explore relationships between dynamical and stellar population properties. The star-forming galaxies typically have observed stellar velocity dispersions of \~{}150 km/s and strong Hdelta absorption (Hd\_A \~{} 5 Angstrom), while passive galaxies have higher observed stellar velocity dispersions \~{}200 km/s and weak Hdelta absortion (Hd\_A \~{} 0 Angstrom). Strong [O III]5007 / Hbeta ratios tend to occur mostly for galaxies with weak Hd\_A or galaxies with higher observed velocity dispersion. Beyond these broad trends, we find a large diversity of possible combinations of rest-frame colors, absorption line strengths and emission line detections, illustrating the utility of spectroscopic measurements to more accurately understand galaxy evolution. By making the spectra and value-added catalogs publicly available we encourage the community to take advantage of this very substantial investment in telescope time provided by ESO.},

  abstract      = {The ultraviolet (UV) polarization spectrum of nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN) is poorly known. The Wisconsin Ultraviolet Photo-Polarimeter Experiment and a handful of instruments on board the Hubble Space Telescope were able to probe the near- and mid-UV polarization of nearby AGN, but the far-UV band (from 1200 angs down to the Lyman limit at 912 angs) remains completely uncharted. In addition, the linewidth resolution of previous observations was at best 1.89 angs. Such a resolution is not sufficient to probe in detail quantum mechanical effects, synchrotron and cyclotron processes, scattering by electrons and dust grains, and dichroic extinction by asymmetric dust grains. Exploring those physical processes would require a new, high-resolution, broadband polarimeter with full ultraviolet-band coverage. In this context, we discuss the AGN science case for POLLUX, a high-resolution UV spectropolarimeter, proposed for the 15-meter primary mirror option of LUVOIR (a multi-wavelength space observatory concept being developed by the Goddard Space Flight Center and proposed for the 2020 Decadal Survey Concept Study).},

  abstract      = {Mass models of 100 nearby spiral and irregular galaxies, covering morphological types from Sa to Irr, are computed using H$\alpha$ rotation curves and R$\_c$-band surface brightness profiles. The kinematics was obtained using a scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer. One of the aims is to compare our results with those from Korsaga et al. (2018), which used mid-infrared (MIR) WISE W1 (3.4 $\mu$m) photometric data. For the analysis, the same tools were used for both bands. Pseudo-Isothermal (ISO) core and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) cuspy models have been used. We test Best Fit Models (BFM), Maximum Disc Models (MDM) and models for which M/L is fixed using the B - V colors. Similarly to what was found in the MIR 3.4 $\mu$m band, most of the observed rotation curves are better described by a central core density profile (ISO) than a cuspy one (NFW) when using the optical R$\_c$-band. In both bands, the dispersion in the (M/L) values is smaller for the fixed M/L fits. As for the W1 photometry, the derived DM halos' parameters depend on the morphological types. We find similar relations than those in the literature, only when we compare our results for the bulge-poor sub-sample because most of previous results were mainly based on late-type spirals. Because the dispersion in the model parameters is smaller and because stellar masses are better defined in that band, MIR photometry should be preferred, when possible, to the optical bands. It is shown that for high-z galaxies, sensible results can still be obtained without full profile decomposition.},

Combining these low- and high-resolution optical spectrographs with the wide field of view (up to 20 arcmin), high multiplex, and integral field capabilities provided by MANIFEST enables science programs that are not achievable with other extremely large telescopes. For galactic archaeology and near-field cosmology studies of Local Group galaxies, MANIFEST and G-CLEF can obtain up to 40 simultaneous high-resolution optical spectra over a wide field, and so produce detailed kinematic and chemical maps of the stellar populations out to large radius in galaxies covering a broad range of masses and morphologies. For galaxy evolution studies, MANIFEST and GMACS can combine a survey of galaxies at the epoch of peak star formation with a study of the flows of gas between galaxies and the circumgalactic medium, mapping both the emission from hot gas using integral field spectroscopy and the absorption from cold gas with multi-object spectroscopy of background sources. These programs will feature strongly in the early science goals for GMT.},

  abstract      = {We present the first results from a study of OVI absorption around galaxies at $z\lt1.44$ using data from a near-infrared grism spectroscopic Hubble Space Telescope Large Program, the Quasar Sightline and Galaxy Evolution (QSAGE) survey. QSAGE is the first grism galaxy survey to focus on the circumgalactic medium at $z\sim1$, providing a blind survey of the galaxy population. Using the first of 12 fields, we provide details of the reduction methods, in particular the handling of the deep grism data which uses multiple position angles to minimise the effects of contamination from overlapping traces. The resulting galaxy sample is H$\alpha$ flux limited ($f({\rm H\alpha}) \gt 2\times10^{-17}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$) at 0.68$\lt$z$\lt$1.44, corresponding to $\gtrsim0.2-0.8$ M$\_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. We combine the galaxy data with high-resolution STIS and COS spectroscopy of the background quasar to study OVI in the circumgalactic medium. At z$\gt$0.68, we find 5 OVI absorption systems along the line of sight with identified galaxies lying at impact parameters of $b\approx100-350$ kpc (proper), whilst we find a further 13 galaxies with no significant associated OVI absorption (i.e. $N({\rm OVI})\lt10^{13.5-14}$ cm$^{-2}$) in the same impact parameter and redshift range. We find a large scatter in the stellar mass and star-formation rates of the closest galaxies with associated OVI. Whilst one of the OVI absorber systems is found to be associated with a low mass galaxy group at $z\approx1.08$, we infer that the detected OVI absorbers typically lie in the proximity of dark matter halos of masses $10^{11.5} {\rm M\_\odot}\lesssim M\_{\rm halo}\lesssim10^{12} {\rm M\_\odot}$.},

The major objective of the observing programme was the study of the hot phase of the ISM in M31. The analysis of the diffuse emission and the study of the ISM is presented in a separate paper. We analysed the spectral properties of all detected sources using hardness ratios and spectra if the statistics were high enough. We also checked for variability. We cross-correlated the source list with the source catalogue of a new survey of the northern disc of M31 carried out with Chandra and Hubble (Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury, PHAT) as well as with other existing catalogues. We detected a total of 389 sources, including 43 foreground stars and candidates and 50 background sources. Based on the comparison to the Chandra/PHAT survey, we classify 24 hard X-ray sources as new candidates for X-ray binaries (XRBs). In total, we identified 34 XRBs and candidates and 18 supernova remnants (SNRs) and candidates. Three of the four brightest SNRs show emission mainly below 2 keV, consistent with shocked ISM. The spectra of two of them also require an additional component with a higher temperature. The SNR [SPH11] 1535 has a harder spectrum and might suggest that there is a pulsar-wind nebula inside the SNR. We find five new sources showing clear time variability. We also studied the spectral properties of the transient source SWIFT J004420.1+413702, which shows significant variation in flux over a period of seven months (June 2015 to January 2016) and associated change in absorption. Based on the likely optical counterpart detected in the Chandra/PHAT survey, the source is classified as a low-mass X-ray binary.},

  abstract      = {We present the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey (MaDCoWS), a search for galaxy clusters at 0.7$\lt$z$\lt$1.5 based upon data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission. MaDCoWS is the first cluster survey capable of discovering massive clusters at these redshifts over the full extragalactic sky. The search is divided into two regions -- the region of the extragalactic sky covered by Pan-STARRS (Dec$\gt$-30 degrees) and the remainder of the southern extragalactic sky at Dec$\lt$-30 degrees for which shallower optical data from SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey is available. In this paper we describe the search algorithm, characterize the sample, and present the first MaDCoWS data release -- catalogs of the 2433 highest amplitude detections in the WISE--Pan-STARRS region and the 250 highest amplitude detections in the WISE--SuperCOSMOS region. A total of 1723 of the detections from the WISE--Pan-STARRS sample have also been observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope, providing photometric redshifts and richnesses, and an additional 64 detections within the WISE--SuperCOSMOS region also have photometric redshifts and richnesses. Spectroscopic redshifts for 38 MaDCoWS clusters with IRAC photometry demonstrate that the photometric redshifts have an uncertainty of $\sigma\_z/(1+z)\sim0.036$. Combining the richness measurements with Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations of MaDCoWS clusters, we also present a preliminary mass-richness relation that can be used to infer the approximate mass distribution of the full sample. The estimated median mass for the WISE--Pan-STARRS catalog is $M\_{500}=1.6^{+0.7}\_{-0.8}\times10^{14} \mathrm{M}\_\odot$, with the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich data confirming that we detect clusters with masses up to $M\_{500}\sim5\times10^{14} \mathrm{M}\_\odot$ $(M\_{200}\sim10^{15} \mathrm{M}\_\odot)$.},

  abstract      = {White dwarfs are one of the few types of stellar objects for which we know almost nothing about the possible existence of companion planets. Recent evidence for metal contaminated atmospheres, circumstellar debris disks and transiting planetary debris all indicate that planets may be likely. However, white dwarf transit surveys are challenging due to the intrinsic faintness of such objects, the short timescale of the transits and the low transit probabilities due to their compact radii. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) offers a remedy to these problems as a deep, half-sky survey with fast exposures encompassing approximately 10 million white dwarfs with $r\lt24.5$ apparent magnitude. We simulate LSST photometric observations of 3.5 million white dwarfs over a ten-year period and calculate the detectability of companion planets with $P\lt10$ d via transits. We find typical detection rates in the range of $5 \times 10^{-6}$ to $4 \times 10^{-4}$ for Ceres-sized bodies to Earth-sized worlds, yielding $\sim 50$ to $4\,000$ detections for a 100\% occurrence rate of each. For terrestrial planets in the continuously habitable zone, we find detection rates of $\sim 10^{-3}$ indicating that LSST would reveal hundreds of such worlds for occurrence rates in the range of 1\% to 10\%.},

  abstract      = {The Fornax Deep Survey (FDS), an imaging survey in the u', g', r', and i'-bands, has a supreme resolution and image depth compared to the previous spatially complete Fornax Cluster Catalog (FCC). Our new data allows us to study the galaxies down to r'-band magnitude m$\_{r'}\approx$21 mag (M$\_{r'}\approx$-10.5 mag). These data provide an important legacy dataset to study the Fornax cluster. We aim to present the Fornax Deep Survey (FDS) dwarf galaxy catalog, focusing on explaining the data reduction and calibrations, assessing the quality of the data, and describing the methods used for defining the cluster memberships for the catalog objects. As a first step we used the SExtractor fine-tuned for dwarf galaxy detection, to find galaxies from the FDS data, covering a 26 deg$^2$ area of the main cluster, and the area around the Fornax A substructure. We made 2D-decompositions of the identified galaxies using GALFIT. We used color-magnitude, luminosity-radius and luminosity-concentration relations to separate the cluster galaxies from the background galaxies. We then divided the cluster galaxies into early- and late-type galaxies according to their morphology and gave first order morphological classifications. Our final catalog includes 14,095 galaxies. We classify 590 galaxies as being likely Fornax cluster galaxies, of which 564 are dwarfs (M$\_{r'}$ $\gt$ -18.5 mag) consisting our Fornax dwarf catalog. Of the cluster dwarfs we classify 470 as early-types, and 94 as late-type galaxies. Our final catalog reaches its 50\% completeness limit at magnitude M$\_{r'}$ = -10.5 mag and surface brightness $\bar{\mu}\_{e,r'}$ = 26 mag arcsec-2, which is approximately three magnitudes deeper than the FCC. Based on previous works and comparison with a spectroscopically confirmed subsample, we estimate that our final Fornax dwarf galaxy catalog has $\lt$ 10\% contamination from the background objects.},
