  abstract      = {Spectra of the intermediate age star cluster NGC 1978 and the dwarf irregular galaxies NGC 55 and NGC 3109 that span the 0.7 to 1.1um wavelength interval are discussed. The NGC 1978 spectra are used to examine stochastic effects on the integrated red light from an intermediate age cluster. The removal of either the brightest M giant or the brightest C star from the co-added NGC 1978 spectrum has minor effects on the equivalent withs of the Ca triplet. The most robust signature of C stars in the integrated cluster spectrum at these wavelengths is the CN band head near 0.79um. The equivalent widths of Ca triplet lines in the NGC 1978 spectrum and in the spectra of individual cluster stars are larger than expected for a scaled-solar abundance system, and it is suggested that these stars have been subject to extra mixing processes. Ca lines weaken with increasing distance from the disk plane in the NGC 55 spectra. Comparisons with models suggest that the red light from NGC 55 is dominated by stars with ages 1 - 2 Gyr, in agreement with star-forming histories (SFHs) obtained from the analysis of CMDs. The NGC 3109 observations sample three different parts of that galaxy but have a low signal-to-noise ratio. Comparisons with models suggest that the light from the NGC 3109 disk at red wavelengths is dominated by RSGs with ages of at most a few tens of Myr, in qualitative agreement with SFHs that are based on photometric measurements.},

  title       = {Snake in the Clouds: A new nearby dwarf galaxy in the Magellanic bridge},
  abstract    = {We report the discovery of a nearby dwarf galaxy in the constellation of Hydrus, between the Large and the Small Magellanic Clouds. Hydrus 1 is a mildy elliptical ultra-faint system with luminosity $M_V\sim$ -4.7 and size $\sim$ 50 pc, located 28 kpc from the Sun and 24 kpc from the LMC. From spectroscopy of $\sim$ 30 member stars, we measure a velocity dispersion of 2.7 km/s and find tentative evidence for a radial velocity gradient consistent with 3 km/s rotation. Hydrus 1's velocity dispersion indicates that the system is dark matter dominated, but its dynamical mass-to-light ratio M/L $\sim$ 66 is significantly smaller than typical for ultra-faint dwarfs at similar luminosity. The kinematics and spatial position of Hydrus~1 make it a very plausible member of the family of satellites brought into the Milky Way by the Magellanic Clouds. While Hydrus 1's proximity and well-measured kinematics make it a promising target for dark matter annihilation searches, we find no evidence for significant gamma-ray emission from Hydrus 1. The new dwarf is a metal-poor galaxy with a mean metallicity [Fe/H]=-2.5 and [Fe/H] spread of 0.4 dex, similar to other systems of similar luminosity. Alpha-abundances of Hyi 1 members indicate that star-formation was extended, lasting between 0.1 and 1 Gyr, with self-enrichment dominated by SN Ia. The dwarf also hosts a highly carbon-enhanced extremely metal-poor star with [Fe/H] $\sim$ -3.2 and [C/Fe] $\sim$ +3.0.},

  title       = {Substructures and tidal distortions in the Magellanic stellar periphery},
  abstract    = {We use a new panoramic imaging survey, conducted with the Dark Energy Camera, to map the stellar fringes of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds to extremely low surface brightness V $\gtrsim$ 32 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. Our results starkly illustrate the closely interacting nature of the LMC-SMC pair. We show that the outer LMC disk is strongly distorted, exhibiting an irregular shape, evidence for warping, and significant truncation on the side facing the SMC. Large diffuse stellar substructures are present both to the north and south of the LMC, and in the inter-Cloud region. At least one of these features appears co-spatial with the bridge of RR Lyrae stars that connects the Clouds. The SMC is highly disturbed -- we confirm the presence of tidal tails, as well as a large line-of-sight depth on the side closest to the LMC. Young, intermediate-age, and ancient stellar populations in the SMC exhibit strikingly different spatial distributions. In particular, those with ages $\sim$ 1.5-4 Gyr exhibit a spheroidal distribution with a centroid offset from that of the oldest stars by several degrees towards the LMC. We speculate that the gravitational influence of the LMC may already have been perturbing the gaseous component of the SMC several Gyr ago. With careful modeling, the variety of substructures and tidal distortions evident in the Magellanic periphery should tightly constrain the interaction history of the Clouds.},

  title       = {The Proper Motion Field of the Small Magellanic Cloud: Kinematic Evidence for its Tidal Disruption},
  abstract    = {We present a new measurement of the systemic proper motion of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), based on an expanded set of 30 fields containing background quasars and spanning a $\sim$3 year baseline, using the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} Wide Field Camera 3 (\textit{HST} WFC3). Combining this data with our previous 5 \textit{HST} fields, and an additional 8 measurements from the \textit{Gaia}-Tycho Astrometric Solution Catalog, brings us to a total of 43 SMC fields. We measure a systemic motion of $\mu_{W}$ = $-0.82$ $\pm$ 0.02 (random) $\pm$ 0.10 (systematic) mas yr$^{-1}$ and $\mu_{N}$ = $-1.21$ $\pm$ 0.01 (random) $\pm$ 0.03 (systematic) mas yr$^{-1}$. After subtraction of the systemic motion, we find little evidence for rotation, but find an ordered mean motion radially away from the SMC in the outer regions of the galaxy, indicating that the SMC is in the process of tidal disruption. We model the past interactions of the Clouds with each other based on the measured present-day relative velocity between them of $103 \pm 26$ km s$^{-1}$. We find that in 97\% of our considered cases, the Clouds experienced a direct collision $147 \pm 33$ Myr ago, with a mean impact parameter of $7.5 \pm 2.5$ kpc.},

  title       = {The GALAH Survey: Second Data Release},
  abstract    = {The Galactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) survey is a large-scale stellar spectroscopic survey of the Milky Way and designed to deliver chemical information complementary to a large number of stars covered by the $Gaia$ mission. We present the GALAH second public data release (GALAH DR2) containing 342,682 stars. For these stars, the GALAH collaboration provides stellar parameters and abundances for up to 23 elements to the community. Here we present the target selection, observation, data reduction and detailed explanation of how the spectra were analysed to estimate stellar parameters and element abundances. For the stellar analysis, we have used a multi-step approach. We use the physics-driven spectrum synthesis of Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME) to derive stellar labels ($T_\mathrm{eff}$, $\log g$, $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$, $\mathrm{[X/Fe]}$, $v_\mathrm{mic}$, $v \sin i$, $A_{K_S}$) for a representative training set of stars. This information is then propagated to the whole survey with the data-driven method of $The~Cannon$. Special care has been exercised in the spectral synthesis to only consider spectral lines that have reliable atomic input data and are little affected by blending lines. Departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) are considered for several key elements, including Li, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, and Fe, using 1D MARCS stellar atmosphere models. Validation tests including repeat observations, Gaia benchmark stars, open and globular clusters, and K2 asteroseismic targets lend confidence in our methods and results. Combining the GALAH DR2 catalogue with the kinematic information from $Gaia$ will enable a wide range of Galactic Archaeology studies, with unprecedented detail, dimensionality, and scope.},

  abstract      = {The oldest stars in the Milky Way (MW) bear imprints of the Galaxy's early assembly history. We use FIRE cosmological zoom-in simulations of three MW-mass disk galaxies to study the spatial distribution, chemistry, and kinematics of the oldest surviving stars ($z\_{\rm form} \gtrsim 5$) in MW-like galaxies. We predict the oldest stars to be less centrally concentrated at $z=0$ than stars formed at later times as a result of two processes. First, the majority of the oldest stars are not formed $\textit{in situ}$ but are accreted during hierarchical assembly. These $\textit{ex situ}$ stars are deposited on dispersion-supported, halo-like orbits but dominate over old stars formed $\textit{in situ}$ in the solar neighborhood, and in some simulations, even in the galactic center. Secondly, old stars formed $\textit{in situ}$ are driven outwards by bursty star formation and energetic feedback processes that create a time-varying gravitational potential at $z\gtrsim 2$, similar to the process that creates dark matter cores and expands stellar orbits in bursty dwarf galaxies. The total fraction of stars that are ancient is more than an order of magnitude higher for sight lines $\textit{away}$ from the bulge and inner halo than for inward-looking sight lines. Although the task of identifying specific stars as ancient remains challenging, we anticipate that million-star spectral surveys and photometric surveys targeting metal-poor stars already include hundreds of stars formed before $z=5$. We predict most of these targets to have higher metallicity ($-3 \lt \rm [Fe/H] \lt -2$) than the most extreme metal-poor stars.},

  year          = {2018},

  abstract      = {If the Galaxy is axisymmetric and in dynamical equilibrium, we expect negligible fluctuations in the residual line-of-sight velocity field. However, non-axisymmetric structures like a bar, spiral arms and merger events can generate velocity fluctuations. Recent results using the APOGEE survey find significant fluctuations in velocity for stars in the midplane (|z|$\lt$ 0.25 kpc) and out to 5 kpc, which suggests that the dynamical influence of the Milky Way's bar extends out to the Solar neighborhood. Their measured power spectrum has a characteristic amplitude of 11 km/s on a scale of \~{} 2.5 kpc. The existence of large streaming motions on these scales has important implications for determining the Sun's motion about the Galactic Centre. Using red clump stars from the GALAH and APOGEE surveys, we map the line-of-sight velocity field around the Sun out to distances of 5 kpc and up to 1.25 kpc from the Galactic Plane. By subtracting a smooth axisymmetric model for the velocity field, we study the residual velocity fluctuations and compare our findings with mock survey generated by Galaxia based on an axisymmetric, steady state model. We find negligible large-scale fluctuations away from the plane. In the mid-plane, we reproduce the earlier APOGEE power spectrum results but with 20$\backslash$\% smaller amplitude (9.5 km/s) after taking a few systematic effects into account (e.g. volume completeness). The amplitude power is further reduced to 6.7 km/s if a flexible axisymmetric model is used. Additionally, our mock simulations show that, in the plane, the distances are underestimated for high mass red clump stars and this can lead to spurious power with amplitude of about 5.5 km/s. Taking this into account, we estimate the amplitude of real fluctuations to be less than 4.2 km/s, about a factor of three less than the previous result from APOGEE.},
