  abstract = {The presence of extremely compact galaxies at z ~ 2 and their subsequent growth in physical size has been the cause of much puzzlement. We revisit the question using deep infrared Wide Field Camera 3 data to probe the rest-frame optical structure of 935 galaxies selected with 0.4 < z < 2.5 and stellar masses M * > 10 10.7 M ☉ in the UKIRT Ultra Deep Survey and GOODS-South fields of the CANDELS survey. At each redshift, the most compact sources are those with little or no star formation, and the mean size of these systems at fixed stellar mass grows by a factor of 3.5 ± 0.3 over this redshift interval. The data are sufficiently deep to identify companions to these hosts whose stellar masses are ten times smaller. By searching for these around 404 quiescent hosts within a physical annulus 10 h –1 kpc < R < 30 h –1 kpc, we estimate the minor merger rate over 0.4 < z < 2. We find that 13%-18% of quiescent hosts have likely physical companions with stellar mass ratios of 0.1 or greater. Mergers of these companions will typically increase the host mass by 6% ± 2% per merger timescale. We estimate the minimum growth rate necessary to explain the declining abundance of compact galaxies. Using a simple model motivated by recent numerical simulations, we then assess whether mergers of the faint companions with their hosts are sufficient to explain this minimal rate. We find that mergers may explain most of the size evolution observed at z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 1 if a relatively short merger timescale is assumed, but the rapid growth seen at higher redshift likely requires additional physical processes.},

SHARDS provides medium-band photometry equivalent to low-resolution optical spectra (R {\tilde} 50), allowing us to obtain extremely accurate photometric redshifts (median |{$\Delta$}z|/(1 + z) {\tilde} 0.55 per cent) and to improve the constraints on the age distribution of the stellar populations. Our data set is volume limited, probing merger progenitors with mass ratios 1:100 ({$\mu$} {\equiv} M$_{sat}$/M$_{cen}$ = 0.01) out to z = 1.3. A strong correlation is found between the age difference of host and companion galaxy and stellar mass ratio, from negligible age differences in major mergers to age differences {\tilde}4 Gyr for 1:100 minor mergers. However, this correlation is simply a reflection of the mass-age trend in the general population. The dominant contributor to the growth of massive galaxies corresponds to mass ratios {$\mu$} {\gsim} 0.3, followed by a decrease in the fractional mass growth rate linearly proportional to log {$\mu$}, at least down to {$\mu$} {\tilde} 0.01, suggesting a decreasing role of mergers involving low-mass companions, especially if dynamical friction time-scales are taken into account. A simple model results in an upper limit for the average mass growth rate of massive galaxies of ({$\Delta$}M/M)/{$\Delta$}t {\tilde} 0.08 {\plusmn} 0.02 Gyr$^{-1}$, over the z {\lsim} 1 range, with an {\tilde}70 per cent fractional contribution from (major) mergers with {$\mu$} {\gsim} 0.3. The majority of the stellar mass contributed by mergers does not introduce significantly younger populations, in agreement with the small radial age gradients observed in present-day early-type galaxies.},

  abstract      = {While major mergers have long been proposed as a driver of both AGN activity and the M-sigma relation, studies of moderate to high redshift Seyfert-luminosity AGN hosts have found little evidence for enhanced rates of interactions. However, both theory and observation suggest that while these AGN may be fueled by stochastic accretion and secular processes, high-luminosity, high-redshift, and heavily obscured AGN are the AGN most likely to be merger-driven. To better sample this population of AGN, we turn to infrared selection in the CANDELS/COSMOS field. Compared to their lower-luminosity and less obscured X-ray-only counterparts, IR-only AGN (luminous, heavily obscured AGN) are more likely to be classified as either irregular (50$^{+12}\_{-12}$\% vs. 9$^{+5}\_{-2}$\%) or asymmetric (69$^{+9}\_{-13}$\% vs. 17$^{+6}\_{-4}$\%) and are less likely to have a spheroidal component (31$^{+13}\_{-9}$\% vs. 77$^{+4}\_{-6}$\%). Furthermore, IR-only AGN are also significantly more likely than X-ray-only AGN (75$^{+8}\_{-13}$\% vs. 31$^{+6}\_{-6}$\%) to be classified either as interacting or merging in a way that significantly disturbs the host galaxy or disturbed though not clearly interacting or merging, which potentially represents the late stages of a major merger. This suggests that while major mergers may not contribute significantly to the fueling of Seyfert luminosity AGN, interactions appear to play a more dominant role in the triggering and fueling of high-luminosity heavily obscured AGN.},

  abstract      = {We present a study of the HI gas content of a large K-band selected sample of 88 close major-merger pairs of galaxies (H-KPAIR) which were observed by $\it Herschel$. We obtained the 21 cm HI fine-structure emission line data for a total of 70 pairs from this sample, by observing 58 pairs using the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) and retrieving the HI data for an addition 12 pairs from the literature. In this HI sample, 34 pairs are spiral-spiral (S+S) pairs, and 36 are spiral-elliptical (S+E). Based on these data, we studied the HI-to-stellar mass ratio, the HI gas fraction and the HI star formation efficiency (SFE$\_{\mathrm{HI}}$ = star formation rate/$M\_{\mathrm{HI}}$) and searched for differences between S+S and S+E pairs, as well as between pairs with and without signs for merger/interaction. Our results showed that the mean HI-to-stellar mass ratio of spirals in these pairs is $=7.6\pm1.0 \\%$, consistent with the average HI gas fraction of spiral galaxies in general. The differences in the HI gas fraction between spirals in S+S and in S+E pairs, and between spirals in pairs with and without signs of merger/interaction are insignificant ($\lt 1 \sigma$). On the other hand, the mean SFE$\_{\mathrm{HI}}$ of S+S pairs is $\sim4.6\times$ higher than that of S+E pairs. This difference is very significant ($\sim 4\sigma$) and is the main result of our study. There is no significant difference in the mean SFE$\_{\mathrm{HI}}$ between galaxies with and without signs of merger/interaction. The mean SFE$\_{\mathrm{HI}}$ of the whole pair sample is $10^{-9.55\pm 0.09}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, corresponding to a HI consumption time of $3.5\pm0.7$\~{}Gyrs.},

  abstract      = {The rate of major galaxy-galaxy merging is theoretically predicted to steadily increase with redshift during the peak epoch of massive galaxy development ($1{\leq}z{\leq}3$). We use close-pair statistics to objectively study the incidence of massive galaxies (stellar $M\_{1}{\geq}2{\times}10^{10}M\_{\odot}$) hosting major companions ($1{\leq}M\_{1}/M\_{2}{\leq}4$; i.e., $\lt$4:1) at six epochs spanning $0{\lt}z{\lt}3$. We select companions from a nearly complete, mass-limited ($\geq5{\times}10^{9}M\_{\odot}$) sample of 23,696 galaxies in the five CANDELS fields and the SDSS. Using $5-50$ kpc projected separation and close redshift proximity criteria, we find that the major companion fraction $f\_{\mathrm{mc}}(z)$ based on stellar mass-ratio (MR) selection increases from 6\% ($z{\sim}0$) to 16\% ($z{\sim}0.8$), then turns over at $z{\sim}1$ and decreases to 7\% ($z{\sim}3$). Instead, if we use a major F160W flux ratio (FR) selection, we find that $f\_{\mathrm{mc}}(z)$ increases steadily until $z=3$ owing to increasing contamination from minor (MR$\gt$4:1) companions at $z\gt1$. We show that these evolutionary trends are statistically robust to changes in companion proximity. We find disagreements between published results are resolved when selection criteria are closely matched. If we compute merger rates using constant fraction-to-rate conversion factors ($C\_{\mathrm{merg,pair}}{=}0.6$ and $T\_{\mathrm{obs,pair}}{=}0.65\mathrm{Gyr}$), we find that MR rates disagree with theoretical predictions at $z{\gt}1.5$. Instead, if we use an evolving $T\_{\mathrm{obs,pair}}(z){\propto}(1+z)^{-2}$ from Snyder et al., our MR-based rates agree with theory at $0{\lt}z{\lt}3$. Our analysis underscores the need for detailed calibration of $C\_{\mathrm{merg,pair}}$ and $T\_{\mathrm{obs,pair}}$ as a function of redshift, mass and companion selection criteria to better constrain the empirical major merger history.},

  abstract    = {We present results from an X-ray and radio study of the merging galaxy cluster Abell 115. We use the full set of 5 Chandra observations taken of A115 to date (360 ks total integration) to construct high-fidelity temperature and surface brightness maps. We also examine radio data from the Very Large Array at 1.5 GHz and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope at 0.6 GHz. We propose that the high X-ray spectral temperature between the subclusters results from the interaction of the bow shocks driven into the intracluster medium by the motion of the subclusters relative to one another. We have identified morphologically similar scenarios in Enzo numerical N-body/hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy clusters in a cosmological context. In addition, the giant radio relic feature in A115, with an arc-like structure and a relatively flat spectral index, is likely consistent with other shock-associated giant radio relics seen in other massive galaxy clusters. We suggest a dynamical scenario that is consistent with the structure of the X-ray gas, the hot region between the clusters, and the radio relic feature.},

We use the Gini coefficient and M$_{20}$ to identify major mergers and classify galaxy morphology for a volume-limited sample of 3009 galaxies brighter than 0.4L$^{*}$$_{B}$, assuming pure luminosity evolution. We find that the merger fraction remains roughly constant at 10\% +/- 2\% for 0.2 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1.2. The fraction of E/S0/Sa galaxies increases from 21\% +/- 3\% at z \~{} 1.1 to 44\% +/- 9\% at z \~{} 0.3, while the fraction of Sb-Ir galaxies decreases from 64\% +/- 6\% at z \~{} 1.1 to 47\% +/- 9\% at z \~{} 0.3. The majority of z $\lt$ 1.2 Spitzer MIPS 24 {$\mu$}m sources with L(IR) $\gt$ 10$^{11}$ L$_{⊙}$ are disk galaxies, and only \~{}15\% are classified as major merger candidates. Edge-on and dusty disk galaxies (Sb-Ir) are almost a third of the red sequence at z \~{} 1.1, while E/S0/Sa make up over 90\% of the red sequence at z \~{} 0.3. Approximately 2\% of our full sample are red mergers. We conclude (1) the merger rate does not evolve strongly between 0.2 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1.2; (2) the decrease in the volume-averaged star formation rate density since z \~{} 1 is a result of declining star formation in disk galaxies rather than a disappearing population of major mergers; (3) the build-up of the red sequence at z $\lt$ 1 can be explained by a doubling in the number of spheroidal galaxies since z \~{} 1.2.},

We demonstrate that the correlation between the stellar mass surface density ($\Sigma\_*$) and star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma\_{\mathrm{SFR}}$) holds down to sub-galactic scale, leading to the Sub-Galactic Main Sequence (SGMS). By dividing galaxies into two populations based on their recent mass assembly modes, we find the resolved main sequence in galaxies with 'outside-in' mode is steeper than that in galaxies with 'inside-out' mode. This is also confirmed on a galaxy-by-galaxy level, where we find the distributions of SGMS slopes for individual galaxies are clearly separated for the two populations. When normalizing and stacking the SGMS of individual galaxies on one panel for the two populations, we find the inner regions of galaxies with 'inside-out' mode statistically exhibit a suppression in star formation, with a less significant trend in the outer regions of galaxies with 'outside-in' mode. In contrast, the inner regions of galaxies with 'outside-in' mode and the outer regions of galaxies with 'inside-out' mode follow a slightly sub-linear scaling relation with a slope $\sim$0.9, which is in good agreement with previous findings, suggesting that they are experiencing a universal regulation without influences of additional physical processes.},

We conclude that the main galaxy assembly mode is transiting from {\ldquo}the outside-in{\rdquo} mode to {\ldquo}the inside-out{\rdquo} mode at $\{$$\{$M$\}$$_{*}$$\}$$\backslash$lt $\{$$\{$10$\}$$^{10}$$\}$ $\{$$\{$M$\}$$_{⊙ }$$\}$ and at $\{$$\{$M$\}$$_{*}$$\}$$\backslash$gt $\{$$\{$10$\}$$^{10.5}$$\}$ $\{$$\{$M$\}$$_{⊙ }$$\}$. We argue that the physical origin of this is the compromise between the internal and the external processes that drive the star formation quenching in galaxies. These results can be checked with the upcoming large data produced by the ongoing integral field spectroscopic survey projects, such as CALIFA, MaNGA, and SAMI in the near future.},

  abstract = {We study the structural evolution of massive galaxies by linking progenitors and descendants at a constant cumulative number density of n c = 1.4 × 10 –4 Mpc –3 to z ~ 3. Structural parameters were measured by fitting Sérsic profiles to high-resolution CANDELS HST WFC3 J 125 and H 160 imaging in the UKIDSS-UDS at 1 < z < 3 and ACS I 814 imaging in COSMOS at 0.25 < z < 1. At a given redshift, we selected the HST band that most closely samples a common rest-frame wavelength so as to minimize systematics from color gradients in galaxies. At fixed n c , galaxies grow in stellar mass by a factor of ~3 from z ~ 3 to z ~ 0. The size evolution is complex: galaxies appear roughly constant in size from z ~ 3 to z ~ 2 and then grow rapidly to lower redshifts. The evolution in the surface mass density profiles indicates that most of the mass at r < 2 kpc was in place by z ~ 2, and that most of the new mass growth occurred at larger radii. This inside-out mass growth is therefore responsible for the larger sizes and higher Sérsic indices of the descendants toward low redshift. At z < 2, the effective radius evolves with the stellar mass as r e ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} M 2.0 , consistent with scenarios that find dissipationless minor mergers to be a key driver of size evolution. The progenitors at z ~ 3 were likely star-forming disks with r e ~ 2 kpc, based on their low Sérsic index of n ~ 1, low median axis ratio of b / a ~ 0.52, and typical location in the star-forming region of the U – V versus V – J diagram. By z ~ 1.5, many of these star-forming disks disappeared, giving rise to compact quiescent galaxies. Toward lower redshifts, these galaxies continued to assemble mass at larger radii and became the local ellipticals that dominate the high-mass end of the mass function at the present epoch.},

  abstract      = {[abridged] We quantify the evolution of the stellar mass functions of star-forming and quiescent galaxies as a function of morphology from $z\sim 3$ to the present. Our sample consists of \~{}50,000 galaxies in the CANDELS fields ($\sim880$ $arcmin^2$), which we divide into four main morphological types, i.e. pure bulge dominated systems, pure spiral disk dominated, intermediate 2-component bulge+disk systems and irregular disturbed galaxies. Our main results are: Star-formation: At $z\sim 2$, 80$\backslash$\% of the stellar mass density of star-forming galaxies is in irregular systems. However, by $z\sim 0.5$, irregular objects only dominate at stellar masses below $10^9M\odot$. A majority of the star-forming irregulars present at $z\sim 2$ undergo a gradual transformation from disturbed to normal spiral disk morphologies by $z\sim 1$ without significant interruption to their star-formation. Rejuvenation after a quenching event does not seem to be common except perhaps for the most massive objects. Quenching: We confirm that galaxies reaching a stellar mass of $M\_*\sim10^{10.8}M\_\odot$ ($M^*$) tend to quench. Also, quenching implies the presence of a bulge: the abundance of massive red disks is negligible at all redshifts over 2\~{}dex in stellar mass. However the dominant quenching mechanism evolves. At $z\gt2$, the SMF of quiescent galaxies above $M^*$ is dominated by compact spheroids. Quenching at this early epoch destroys the disk and produces a compact remnant unless the star-forming progenitors at even higher redshifts are significantly more dense. At $1\ltz\lt2$, the majority of newly quenched galaxies are disks with a significant central bulge. This suggests that mass-quenching at this epoch starts from the inner parts and preserves the disk. At $z\lt1$, the high mass end of the passive SMF is globally in place and the evolution mostly happens at stellar masses below $10^{10}M\_\odot$.},

  abstract = {Using a high-resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulation of the formation of a massive spheroidal galaxy we show that elliptical galaxies can be very compact and massive at high redshift in agreement with recent observations. Accretion of stripped infalling stellar material increases the size of the system with time and the central concentration is reduced by dynamical friction of the surviving stellar cores. In a specific case of a spheroidal galaxy with a final stellar mass of 1.5 × 10 11 M ☉ we find that the effective radius r e increases from 0.7 ± 0.2 kpc at z = 3 to r e = 2.4 ± 0.4 kpc at z = 0 with a concomitant decrease in the effective density of an order of magnitude and a decrease of the central velocity dispersion by approximately 20% over this time interval. A simple argument based on the virial theorem shows that during the accretion of weakly bound material (minor mergers) the radius can increase as the square of the mass in contrast to the usual linear rate of increase for major mergers. By undergoing minor mergers compact high-redshift spheroids can evolve into present-day systems with sizes and concentrations similar to observed local ellipticals. This indicates that minor mergers may be the main driver for the late evolution of sizes and densities of early-type galaxies.},

For z ~ 2 galaxies with moderate luminosities ( L 8 μm < 10 11 L ☉ ), we find that the SFR can be estimated consistently from the multiwavelength data based on local luminosity correlations. However, 20%-30% of massive galaxies, and nearly all those with L 8 μm > 10 11 L ☉ , show a mid-IR excess that is likely due to the presence of obscured active nuclei, as shown in a companion paper. There is a tight and roughly linear correlation between stellar mass and SFR for 24 μm-detected galaxies. For a given mass, the SFR at z = 2 was larger by a factor of ~4 and ~30 relative to that in star-forming galaxies at z = 1 and 0, respectively. Typical ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z = 2 are relatively "transparent" to ultraviolet light, and their activity is long lived ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {gtrsim} 400 Myr), unlike that in local ULIRGs and high-redshift submillimeter-selected galaxies. ULIRGs are the common mode of star formation in massive galaxies at z = 2, and the high duty cycle suggests that major mergers are not the dominant trigger for this activity. Current galaxy formation models underpredict the normalization of the mass-SFR correlation by about a factor of 4 and the space density of ULIRGs by an order of magnitude but give better agreement for z > 1.4 quiescent galaxies.},

The 393 objects observed cover a 26.2 arcmin\^{}2\^{} area and constitute a nearly complete sample down to K = 20, I = 23, and B = 24.5. The rest-frame K- band luminosity function and its evolution with redshift are described. Comparisons are made with other optically selected (B and I) samples in the literature, and the corresponding rest-frame B-band luminosity function evolution is presented. The B-band counts at B \~{} 24 are shown to be a mixture of normal galaxies at modest redshifts and galaxies undergoing rapid star formation, which have a wide range of masses and which are spread over the redshift interval from z = 0.2 to beyond z = 1.7. The luminosity functions, number counts, and color distributions at optical and IR wavelengths are discussed in terms of a consistent picture of the star-forming history of the galaxy sample. [O II] emission-line diagnostics or rest-frame ultraviolet-infrared color information are used in combination with rest-frame absolute H magnitudes to construct a ``fundamental plane'' in which the evolution of the global star-formation rate with redshift can be shown, and we find that the maximum rest-frame K luminosity of galaxies undergoing rapid star formation has been declining smoothly with decreasing redshift from a value near L\_*\_ at z $\gt$ 1. This smooth decrease in the characteristic luminosity of galaxies dominated by star formation can simultaneously account for the high B- band galaxy counts at faint magnitudes and the redshift distribution at z $\lt$ 1 in both the B- and K-selected samples. Finally, the overall K-band light density evolution is discussed as a tracer of the baryonic mass in stars and compared with the overall rates of star formation inferred from the rest-frame ultraviolet light density as a function of redshift.},

Instead, bulges (and black holes) likely formed in lockstep with disks, through bar instabilities, migration, or other processes. We find that after z = 1 the growth in the central regions gradually stopped and the disk continued to be built up, consistent with recent studies of the gas distributions in z ~ 1 galaxies and the properties of many spiral galaxies today.},

  abstract = {We aim to provide a holistic view on the typical size and kinematic evolution of massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) that encompasses their high- z star-forming progenitors, their high- z quiescent counterparts, and their configurations in the local Universe. Our investigation covers the main processes playing a relevant role in the cosmic evolution of ETGs. Specifically, their early fast evolution comprises biased collapse of the low angular momentum gaseous baryons located in the inner regions of the host dark matter halo; cooling, fragmentation, and infall of the gas down to the radius set by the centrifugal barrier; further rapid compaction via clump/gas migration toward the galaxy center, where strong heavily dust-enshrouded star formation takes place and most of the stellar mass is accumulated; and ejection of substantial gas amount from the inner regions by feedback processes, which causes a dramatic puffing-up of the stellar component. In the late slow evolution, passive aging of stellar populations and mass additions by dry merger events occur. We describe these processes relying on prescriptions inspired by basic physical arguments and by numerical simulations to derive new analytical estimates of the relevant sizes, timescales, and kinematic properties for individual galaxies along their evolution. Then we obtain quantitative results as a function of galaxy mass and redshift, and compare them to recent observational constraints on half-light size R e , on the ratio v / σ between rotation velocity and velocity dispersion (for gas and stars) and on the specific angular momentum j ⋆ of the stellar component; we find good consistency with the available multiband data in average values and dispersion, both for local ETGs and for their z ∼ 1–2 star-forming and quiescent progenitors. The outcomes of our analysis can provide hints to gauge sub-grid recipes implemented in simulations, to tune numerical experiments focused on specific processes, and to plan future multiband, high-resolution observations on high-redshift star-forming and quiescent galaxies with next-generation facilities.},

After converting literature B -band disk galaxy magnitudes into inclination- and dust-corrected bulge magnitudes, via a useful new equation presented herein, we obtain a similar result. Unlike with the M bh -(velocity dispersion) diagram, which is also updated here using the same galaxy sample, it remains unknown whether barred and non-barred Sérsic galaxies are offset from each other in the M bh - L diagram. While black hole feedback has typically been invoked to explain what was previously thought to be a nearly constant M bh / M Spheroid mass ratio of ~0.2%, we advocate that the near-linear M bh - L and M bh - M Spheroid relations observed at high masses may have instead arisen largely from the additive dry merging of galaxies. We argue that feedback results in a dramatically different scaling relation, such that black hole mass scales roughly quadratically with the spheroid mass in Sérsic galaxies. We therefore introduce a revised cold-gas "quasar" mode feeding equation for semi-analytical models to reflect what we dub the quadratic growth of black holes in Sérsic galaxies built amidst gas-rich processes. Finally, we use our new Sérsic M bh - L equations to predict the masses of candidate intermediate mass black holes in almost 50 low-luminosity spheroids containing active galactic nuclei, finding many masses between that of stellar mass black holes and supermassive black holes.},

At ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn4.gif] {$z\lt 1$} , the population matches the massive end of the Hubble sequence, with 30% of pure spheroids, 50% of galaxies with equally dominant disk and bulge components, and 20% of disks.

We then analyze the stellar populations, star formation rates (SFRs), gas fractions, and structural properties for the different morphologies independently.

Around ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn7.gif] {$\sim 30\%-40\%$} were already bulges at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn8.gif] {$z\sim 2.5$} , with low average SFRs and gas fractions ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn9.gif] {$10\%-15\%$} ), high Sérsic indices ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn10.gif] {$n\gt 3-4$} ), and small effective radii ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn11.gif] {${R}_{{\rm{e}}}\sim 1$} kpc), pointing toward an even earlier formation through gas-rich mergers or violent disk instabilities. Between ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn12.gif] {$z\sim 2.5$} and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn13.gif] {$z\sim 0$} , they rapidly increase their size by a factor of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn14.gif] {$\sim 4-5$} , are quenched, and slightly increase their Sérsic indices ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn15.gif] {$n\sim 5$} ) but their global morphology remains unaltered. The structural evolution is independent of the gas fractions, suggesting that it is driven by ex situ events. The remaining 60% experience a gradual morphological transformation, from clumpy disks to more regular bulge+disk systems, essentially happening at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/95/apj516975ieqn16.gif] {$z\gt 1$} .

The transition phase between disturbed and relaxed systems and the emergence of the bulge is correlated with a decrease in the star formation activity and the gas fractions, suggesting a morphological quenching process as a plausible mechanism for the formation of these bulges.},

We calculate stellar masses and photometric redshifts, based on \~{}2000 templates built with stellar population and dust emission models fitting the ultraviolet to mid-infrared spectral energy distributions of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts. We estimate stellar mass functions for different redshift intervals. We find that 50\% of the local stellar mass density was assembled at 0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1 (average star formation rate [SFR] 0.048 M$_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$), and at least another 40\% at 1 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 4 (average SFR 0.074 M$_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$). Our results confirm and quantify the ``downsizing'' scenario of galaxy formation. The most massive galaxies (M $\gt$ 10$^{12.0}$ M$_{⊙}$) assembled the bulk of their stellar content rapidly (in 1-2 Gyr) beyond z \~{} 3 in very intense star formation events (producing high specific SFRs). Galaxies with 10$^{11.5}$ $\lt$ M $\lt$ 10$^{12.0}$ M$_{⊙}$ assembled half of their stellar mass before z \~{} 1.5, and more than 90\% of their mass was already in place at z \~{} 0.6. Galaxies with M $\lt$ 10$^{11.5}$ M$_{⊙}$ evolved more slowly (presenting smaller specific SFRs), assembling half of their stellar mass below z \~{} 1. About 40\% of the local stellar mass density of 10$^{9.0}$ $\lt$ M $\lt$ 10$^{11.0}$ M$_{⊙}$ galaxies was assembled below z \~{} 0.4, most probably through accretion of small satellites producing little star formation. The cosmic stellar mass density at z $\gt$ 2.5 is dominated by optically faint (Rgtrsim 25) red galaxies (distant red galaxies or BzK sources), which account for \~{}30\% of the global population of galaxies, but contribute at least 60\% of the cosmic stellar mass density. Bluer galaxies (e.g., Lyman break galaxies) are more numerous but less massive, contributing less than 50\% of the global stellar mass density at high redshift.},

Employing this capability over all five 3D- HST /CANDELS fields provides a sample of 3200 galaxies enabling a division into subsamples based on stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR). By creating deep stacked H α images, we reach surface brightness limits of 1 × 10 −18 erg s −1 cm −2 arcsec −2 , allowing us to map the distribution of ionized gas to ∼10 kpc for typical L * galaxies at this epoch. We find that the spatial extent of the H α distribution increases with stellar mass as ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/828/1/27/apjaa2d0cieqn1.gif] {${r}_{{\rm{H}}\alpha }=1.5{({M}_{* }/{10}^{10}{M}_{\odot })}^{0.23}$} kpc. The H α emission is more extended than the stellar continuum emission, consistent with inside-out assembly of galactic disks. This effect grows stronger with mass as ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/828/1/27/apjaa2d0cieqn2.gif] {${r}_{{\rm{H}}\alpha }/{r}_{* }=1.1\,{({M}_{* }/{10}^{10}{M}_{\odot })}^{0.054}$} . We map the H α distribution as a function of SFR(IR+UV) and find evidence for “coherent star formation” across the SFR– M * plane: above the main sequence (MS), H α is enhanced at all radii; below the MS, H α is depressed at all radii. This suggests that at all masses the physical processes driving the enhancement or suppression of star formation act throughout the disks of galaxies. At high masses ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/828/1/27/apjaa2d0cieqn3.gif] {${10}^{10.5}\lt {M}_{* }/{M}_{\odot }\lt {10}^{11}$} ), above the MS, H α is particularly enhanced in the center, potentially building bulges and/or supermassive black holes. Below the MS, a strong central dip in the EW(H α ), as well as the inferred specific SFR, appears. Importantly, though, across the entirety of the SFR– M * plane, the absolute SFR as traced by H α is always centrally peaked, even in galaxies below the MS.},

Measurements of galaxy rotation velocity $V\_{rot}$, which quantify ordered motions, and gas velocity dispersion $\sigma\_g$, which quantify disordered motions, are adopted from the DEEP2 and SIGMA surveys. This sample covers a continuous baseline in redshift from $z=2.5$ to $z=0.1$, spanning 10 Gyrs. At low redshift, nearly all sufficiently massive star-forming galaxies are rotationally supported ($V\_{rot}\gt\sigma\_g$). By $z=2$, the percentage of galaxies with rotational support has declined to 50$\\%$ at low stellar mass ($10^{9}-10^{10}\,M\_{\odot}$) and 70$\\%$ at high stellar mass ($10^{10}-10^{11}M\_{\odot}$). For $V\_{rot}\,\gt\,3\,\sigma\_g$, the percentage drops below 35$\\%$ for all masses. From $z\,=\,2$ to now, galaxies exhibit remarkably smooth kinematic evolution on average. All galaxies tend towards rotational support with time, and it is reached earlier in higher mass systems. This is mostly due to an average decline in $\sigma\_g$ by a factor of 3 since a redshift of 2, which is independent of mass. Over the same time period, $V\_{rot}$ increases by a factor of 1.5 for low mass systems, but does not evolve for high mass systems. These trends in $V\_{rot}$ and $\sigma\_g$ with time are at a fixed stellar mass and should not be interpreted as evolutionary tracks for galaxy populations. When galaxy populations are linked in time with abundance matching, not only does $\sigma\_g$ decline with time as before, but $V\_{rot}$ strongly increases with time for all galaxy masses. This enhances the evolution in $V\_{rot}/\sigma\_g$. These results indicate that $z\,=\,2$ is a period of disk assembly, during which the strong rotational support present in today's massive disk galaxies is only just beginning to emerge.},

  abstract = {Galaxies with stellar masses near M * contain the majority of stellar mass in the universe, and are therefore of special interest in the study of galaxy evolution. The Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) have present-day stellar masses near M *, at 5 × 10 10 M ☉ (defined here to be MW-mass) and 10 11 M ☉ (defined to be M31-mass). We study the typical progenitors of these galaxies using the FOURSTAR Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE). ZFOURGE is a deep medium-band near-IR imaging survey, which is sensitive to the progenitors of these galaxies out to z ~ 3. We use abundance-matching techniques to identify the main progenitors of these galaxies at higher redshifts. We measure the evolution in the stellar mass, rest-frame colors, morphologies, far-IR luminosities, and star formation rates, combining our deep multiwavelength imaging with near-IR Hubble Space Telescope imaging from Cosmic Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS), and Spitzer and Herschel far-IR imaging from Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-Herschel and CANDELS-Herschel. The typical MW-mass and M31-mass progenitors passed through the same evolution stages, evolving from blue, star-forming disk galaxies at the earliest stages to redder dust-obscured IR-luminous galaxies in intermediate stages and to red, more quiescent galaxies at their latest stages. The progenitors of the MW-mass galaxies reached each evolutionary stage at later times (lower redshifts) and with stellar masses that are a factor of two to three lower than the progenitors of the M31-mass galaxies. The process driving this evolution, including the suppression of star formation in present-day M * galaxies, requires an evolving stellar-mass/halo-mass ratio and/or evolving halo-mass threshold for quiescent galaxies. The effective size and SFRs imply that the baryonic cold-gas fractions drop as galaxies evolve from high redshift to z ~ 0 and are strongly anticorrelated with an increase in the Sérsic index. Therefore, the growth of galaxy bulges in M * galaxies corresponds to a rapid decline in the galaxy gas fractions and/or a decrease in the star formation efficiency.},

  abstract = {The presence of extremely compact galaxies at z ~ 2 and their subsequent growth in physical size has been the cause of much puzzlement. We revisit the question using deep infrared Wide Field Camera 3 data to probe the rest-frame optical structure of 935 galaxies selected with 0.4 < z < 2.5 and stellar masses M * > 10 10.7 M ☉ in the UKIRT Ultra Deep Survey and GOODS-South fields of the CANDELS survey. At each redshift, the most compact sources are those with little or no star formation, and the mean size of these systems at fixed stellar mass grows by a factor of 3.5 ± 0.3 over this redshift interval. The data are sufficiently deep to identify companions to these hosts whose stellar masses are ten times smaller. By searching for these around 404 quiescent hosts within a physical annulus 10 h –1 kpc < R < 30 h –1 kpc, we estimate the minor merger rate over 0.4 < z < 2. We find that 13%-18% of quiescent hosts have likely physical companions with stellar mass ratios of 0.1 or greater. Mergers of these companions will typically increase the host mass by 6% ± 2% per merger timescale. We estimate the minimum growth rate necessary to explain the declining abundance of compact galaxies. Using a simple model motivated by recent numerical simulations, we then assess whether mergers of the faint companions with their hosts are sufficient to explain this minimal rate. We find that mergers may explain most of the size evolution observed at z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 1 if a relatively short merger timescale is assumed, but the rapid growth seen at higher redshift likely requires additional physical processes.},

  abstract      = {We probe the merging channel of massive galaxies over the z = 0.3-1.3 redshift window by studying close pairs in a sample of 238 galaxies with stellar mass {\gsim}10$^{11}$ M$_{⊙}$, from the SHARDS (Survey for High-z Absorption Red and Dead Sources) survey. SHARDS provides medium-band photometry equivalent to low-resolution optical spectra (R {\tilde} 50), allowing us to obtain extremely accurate photometric redshifts (median |{$\Delta$}z|/(1 + z) {\tilde} 0.55 per cent) and to improve the constraints on the age distribution of the stellar populations. Our data set is volume limited, probing merger progenitors with mass ratios 1:100 ({$\mu$} {\equiv} M$_{sat}$/M$_{cen}$ = 0.01) out to z = 1.3. A strong correlation is found between the age difference of host and companion galaxy and stellar mass ratio, from negligible age differences in major mergers to age differences {\tilde}4 Gyr for 1:100 minor mergers. However, this correlation is simply a reflection of the mass-age trend in the general population. The dominant contributor to the growth of massive galaxies corresponds to mass ratios {$\mu$} {\gsim} 0.3, followed by a decrease in the fractional mass growth rate linearly proportional to log {$\mu$}, at least down to {$\mu$} {\tilde} 0.01, suggesting a decreasing role of mergers involving low-mass companions, especially if dynamical friction time-scales are taken into account. A simple model results in an upper limit for the average mass growth rate of massive galaxies of ({$\Delta$}M/M)/{$\Delta$}t {\tilde} 0.08 {\plusmn} 0.02 Gyr$^{-1}$, over the z {\lsim} 1 range, with an {\tilde}70 per cent fractional contribution from (major) mergers with {$\mu$} {\gsim} 0.3. The majority of the stellar mass contributed by mergers does not introduce significantly younger populations, in agreement with the small radial age gradients observed in present-day early-type galaxies.},

  abstract      = {We present a study of the HI gas content of a large K-band selected sample of 88 close major-merger pairs of galaxies (H-KPAIR) which were observed by $\it Herschel$. We obtained the 21 cm HI fine-structure emission line data for a total of 70 pairs from this sample, by observing 58 pairs using the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) and retrieving the HI data for an addition 12 pairs from the literature. In this HI sample, 34 pairs are spiral-spiral (S+S) pairs, and 36 are spiral-elliptical (S+E). Based on these data, we studied the HI-to-stellar mass ratio, the HI gas fraction and the HI star formation efficiency (SFE$\_{\mathrm{HI}}$ = star formation rate/$M\_{\mathrm{HI}}$) and searched for differences between S+S and S+E pairs, as well as between pairs with and without signs for merger/interaction. Our results showed that the mean HI-to-stellar mass ratio of spirals in these pairs is $=7.6\pm1.0 \\%$, consistent with the average HI gas fraction of spiral galaxies in general. The differences in the HI gas fraction between spirals in S+S and in S+E pairs, and between spirals in pairs with and without signs of merger/interaction are insignificant ($\lt 1 \sigma$). On the other hand, the mean SFE$\_{\mathrm{HI}}$ of S+S pairs is $\sim4.6\times$ higher than that of S+E pairs. This difference is very significant ($\sim 4\sigma$) and is the main result of our study. There is no significant difference in the mean SFE$\_{\mathrm{HI}}$ between galaxies with and without signs of merger/interaction. The mean SFE$\_{\mathrm{HI}}$ of the whole pair sample is $10^{-9.55\pm 0.09}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, corresponding to a HI consumption time of $3.5\pm0.7$\~{}Gyrs.},

  abstract      = {The rate of major galaxy-galaxy merging is theoretically predicted to steadily increase with redshift during the peak epoch of massive galaxy development ($1{\leq}z{\leq}3$). We use close-pair statistics to objectively study the incidence of massive galaxies (stellar $M\_{1}{\geq}2{\times}10^{10}M\_{\odot}$) hosting major companions ($1{\leq}M\_{1}/M\_{2}{\leq}4$; i.e., $\lt$4:1) at six epochs spanning $0{\lt}z{\lt}3$. We select companions from a nearly complete, mass-limited ($\geq5{\times}10^{9}M\_{\odot}$) sample of 23,696 galaxies in the five CANDELS fields and the SDSS. Using $5-50$ kpc projected separation and close redshift proximity criteria, we find that the major companion fraction $f\_{\mathrm{mc}}(z)$ based on stellar mass-ratio (MR) selection increases from 6\% ($z{\sim}0$) to 16\% ($z{\sim}0.8$), then turns over at $z{\sim}1$ and decreases to 7\% ($z{\sim}3$). Instead, if we use a major F160W flux ratio (FR) selection, we find that $f\_{\mathrm{mc}}(z)$ increases steadily until $z=3$ owing to increasing contamination from minor (MR$\gt$4:1) companions at $z\gt1$. We show that these evolutionary trends are statistically robust to changes in companion proximity. We find disagreements between published results are resolved when selection criteria are closely matched. If we compute merger rates using constant fraction-to-rate conversion factors ($C\_{\mathrm{merg,pair}}{=}0.6$ and $T\_{\mathrm{obs,pair}}{=}0.65\mathrm{Gyr}$), we find that MR rates disagree with theoretical predictions at $z{\gt}1.5$. Instead, if we use an evolving $T\_{\mathrm{obs,pair}}(z){\propto}(1+z)^{-2}$ from Snyder et al., our MR-based rates agree with theory at $0{\lt}z{\lt}3$. Our analysis underscores the need for detailed calibration of $C\_{\mathrm{merg,pair}}$ and $T\_{\mathrm{obs,pair}}$ as a function of redshift, mass and companion selection criteria to better constrain the empirical major merger history.},

  abstract    = {We present results from an X-ray and radio study of the merging galaxy cluster Abell 115. We use the full set of 5 Chandra observations taken of A115 to date (360 ks total integration) to construct high-fidelity temperature and surface brightness maps. We also examine radio data from the Very Large Array at 1.5 GHz and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope at 0.6 GHz. We propose that the high X-ray spectral temperature between the subclusters results from the interaction of the bow shocks driven into the intracluster medium by the motion of the subclusters relative to one another. We have identified morphologically similar scenarios in Enzo numerical N-body/hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy clusters in a cosmological context. In addition, the giant radio relic feature in A115, with an arc-like structure and a relatively flat spectral index, is likely consistent with other shock-associated giant radio relics seen in other massive galaxy clusters. We suggest a dynamical scenario that is consistent with the structure of the X-ray gas, the hot region between the clusters, and the radio relic feature.},

  abstract = {We present the quantitative rest-frame B morphological evolution and galaxy merger fraction at 0.2 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1.2 as observed by the All-Wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey (AEGIS). We use the Gini coefficient and M$_{20}$ to identify major mergers and classify galaxy morphology for a volume-limited sample of 3009 galaxies brighter than 0.4L$^{*}$$_{B}$, assuming pure luminosity evolution. We find that the merger fraction remains roughly constant at 10\% +/- 2\% for 0.2 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1.2. The fraction of E/S0/Sa galaxies increases from 21\% +/- 3\% at z \~{} 1.1 to 44\% +/- 9\% at z \~{} 0.3, while the fraction of Sb-Ir galaxies decreases from 64\% +/- 6\% at z \~{} 1.1 to 47\% +/- 9\% at z \~{} 0.3. The majority of z $\lt$ 1.2 Spitzer MIPS 24 {$\mu$}m sources with L(IR) $\gt$ 10$^{11}$ L$_{⊙}$ are disk galaxies, and only \~{}15\% are classified as major merger candidates. Edge-on and dusty disk galaxies (Sb-Ir) are almost a third of the red sequence at z \~{} 1.1, while E/S0/Sa make up over 90\% of the red sequence at z \~{} 0.3. Approximately 2\% of our full sample are red mergers. We conclude (1) the merger rate does not evolve strongly between 0.2 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1.2; (2) the decrease in the volume-averaged star formation rate density since z \~{} 1 is a result of declining star formation in disk galaxies rather than a disappearing population of major mergers; (3) the build-up of the red sequence at z $\lt$ 1 can be explained by a doubling in the number of spheroidal galaxies since z \~{} 1.2.},
