  abstract      = {A wealth of new data from upgraded and new radio interferometers are rapidly improving and transforming our understanding of the faint extra-galactic radio sky. Indeed the mounting statistics at sub-mJy and uJy flux levels is finally allowing us to get stringent observational constraints on the faint radio population and on the modeling of its the various components. In this paper I will provide a brief overview of the latest results in areas that are potentially important for an accurate treatment of extra-galactic foregrounds in experiments designed to probe the Epoch of Reionization.},

  abstract      = {In this paper, we report the line-locking phenomenon of the blended narrow absorption lines (NALs) within trough-like broad absorption lines (BALs) in quasar SDSS J021740.96--085447.9 (hereafter J0217--0854). Utilizing the two-epoch spectroscopic observations of J0217--0854 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we find that each of its C$\backslash$,$\{$$\backslash$footnotesize IV$\}$, Si$\backslash$,$\{$$\backslash$footnotesize IV$\}$, N$\backslash$,$\{$$\backslash$footnotesize V$\}$, and Ly$\alpha$ BAL troughs actually contain at least seven NAL systems. By splitting these BAL troughs into multiple NAL systems, we find that the velocity separations between the NAL systems are similar to their doublet splittings, with some of them matching perfectly. Cases like J0217--0854, showing line-locking signatures of NALs within BAL troughs, offer a direct observational evidence for the idea that radiative forces play a significant role in driving BAL (at least for Type N BAL) outflows.},
