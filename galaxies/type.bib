  abstract = {We present a spectroscopic study of 51 compact field galaxies with redshifts z < 1.4 and apparent magnitudes I 814 < 23.74 in the flanking fields of the Hubble Deep Field. These galaxies are compact in the sense that they have small apparent half-light radii ( r 1/2 ≤ 0 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/farcs.gif] {farcs} 5) and high surface brightnesses (μ I 814 ≤ 22.2 mag arcsec -2 ). The spectra, taken at the Keck telescope, show emission lines in 88% of our sample, and only absorption lines in the remaining 12%. Emission-line profiles are roughly Gaussian with velocity widths that range from the measurement limit of σ ~ 35 km s -1 to 150 km s -1 . Rest frame [O II ] λ3727 equivalent widths range from 5 to 94 Å, yielding star formation rates (SFRs) of ~0.1 to 14 M ☉ yr -1 . The analysis of various line diagnostic diagrams reveals that ~60% of compact emission-line galaxies have velocity widths, excitations, Hβ luminosities, SFRs, and mass-to-light ratios characteristic of young star-forming H II galaxies. The remaining 40% form a more heterogeneous class of evolved starbursts, similar to local starburst disk galaxies. We find that, although the compact galaxies at z > 0.7 have similar SFRs per unit mass to those at z < 0.7, they are on average ~10 times more massive . Our sample implies a lower limit for the global comoving SFR density of ~0.004 M ☉ yr -1 Mpc -3 at z = 0.55, and ~0.008 M ☉ yr -1 Mpc -3 at z = 0.85 (assuming Salpeter IMF, H 0 = 50 km s -1 Mpc -1 , and q 0 = 0.5). These values, when compared to estimates for a sample of local compact galaxies selected in a similar fashion, support a history of the universe in which the SFR density declines by a factor ~10 from z = 1 to today. From the comparison with the SFR densities derived for magnitude-limited samples of field galaxies, we conclude that compact emission-line galaxies, though only ~20% of the general field population, may contribute as much as ~45% to the global SFR of the universe at 0.4 < z < 1.},

We determine structural parameters based on I-band imaging using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) equatorial Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 (CS82) survey ({\tilde}170 deg$^{2}$) taking advantage of an exquisite median seeing of {\tilde}0.6 arcsec. We select compact massive (M$_{⋆}$ $\gt$ 5 {\times} 10$^{10}$ M$_{⊙}$) galaxies within the redshift range of 0.2 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 0.6. The large volume sampled allows to decrease the effect of cosmic variance that has hampered the calculation of the number density for this enigmatic population in many previous studies. We undertake an exhaustive analysis in an effort to untangle the various findings inherent to the diverse definition of compactness present in the literature. We find that the absolute number of compact galaxies is very dependent on the adopted definition and can change up to a factor of $\gt$10. We systematically measure a factor of {\tilde}5 more compacts at the same redshift than what was previously reported on smaller fields with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, which are more affected by cosmic variance. This means that the decrease in number density from z {\tilde} 1.5 to z {\tilde} 0.2 might be only of a factor of {\tilde}2-5, significantly smaller than what was previously reported. This supports progenitor bias as the main contributor to the size evolution. This milder decrease is roughly compatible with the predictions from recent numerical simulations. Only the most extreme compact galaxies, with R$_{eff}$ $\lt$ 1.5 {\times} (M$_{⋆}$/10$^{11}$ M$_{⊙}$)$^{0.75}$ and M$_{⋆}$ $\gt$ 10$^{10.7}$ M$_{⊙}$, appear to drop in number by a factor of {\tilde}20 and hence likely experience a noticeable size evolution.},

  abstract = {We set out to test the claim that the recently identified population of compact, massive, and quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2.3 must undergo significant size evolution to match the properties of galaxies found in the local universe. Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; Data Release 7), we have conducted a search for local red sequence galaxies with sizes and masses comparable to those found at z ~ 2.3. The SDSS spectroscopic target selection algorithm excludes high surface brightness objects; we show that this makes incompleteness a concern for such massive, compact galaxies, particularly for low redshifts ( z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 0.05). We have identified63 M * >10 10.7 M ☉ ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 5 × 10 10 M ☉ ) red sequence galaxies at 0.066 < z spec < 0.12 which are smaller than the median size-mass relation by a factor of 2 or more. Consistent with expectations from the virial theorem, the median offset from the mass-velocity dispersion relation for these galaxies is 0.12 dex. We do not, however, find any galaxies with sizes and masses comparable to those observed at z ~ 2.3, implying a decrease in the comoving number density of these galaxies, at fixed size and mass, by a factor of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 5000. This result cannot be explained by incompleteness: in the 0.066 < z < 0.12 interval, we estimate that the SDSS spectroscopic sample should typically be ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 75% complete for galaxies with the sizes and masses seen at high redshift, although for the very smallest galaxies it may be as low as ~20%. In order to confirm that the absence of such compact massive galaxies in SDSS is not produced by spectroscopic selection effects, we have also looked for such galaxies in the basic SDSS photometric catalog, using photometric redshifts. While we do find signs of a slight bias against massive, compact galaxies, this analysis suggests that the SDSS spectroscopic sample is missing at most a few objects in the regime we consider. Accepting the high-redshift results, it is clear that massive galaxies must undergo significant structural evolution over z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 2 in order to match the population seen in the local universe. Our results suggest that a highly stochastic mechanism (e.g., major mergers) cannot be the primary driver of this strong size evolution.},

  abstract = {As early as 10 Gyr ago, galaxies with more than 10 11 M ☉ of stars already existed. While most of these massive galaxies must have subsequently transformed through on-going star formation and mergers with other galaxies, a small fraction ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 0.1%) may have survived untouched until today. Searches for such relic galaxies, useful windows to explore the early universe, have been inconclusive to date: galaxies with masses and sizes like those observed at high redshift ( M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sstarf.gif] {sstarf} ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 10 11 M ☉ ; R e ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 1.5 kpc) have been found in the local universe, but their stars are far too young for the galaxy to be a relic galaxy. This paper explores the first case of a nearby galaxy, NGC 1277 (at a distance of 73 Mpc in the Perseus galaxy cluster), which fulfills many criteria to be considered a relic galaxy. Using deep optical spectroscopy, we derive the star formation history along the structure of the galaxy: the stellar populations are uniformly old (>10 Gyr) with no evidence for more recent star formation episodes. The metallicity of their stars is super-solar ([Fe/H] = 0.20 ± 0.04 with a smooth decline toward the outer regions) and α-enriched ([α/Fe] = 0.4 ± 0.1). This suggests a very short formation time scale for the bulk of the stars in this galaxy. This object also rotates very fast ( V rot ~ 300 km s –1 ) and has a large central velocity dispersion (σ > 300 km s –1 ). NGC 1277 allows the exploration in full detail of properties such as the structure, internal dynamics, metallicity, and initial mass function as they were at ~10-12 Gyr ago when the first massive galaxies were built.},

  abstract      = {We study the evolution of the core (r$\lt$1 kpc) and effective (r$\lt$r\_e) stellar-mass surface densities, in star-forming and quiescent galaxies. Since z=3, both populations occupy distinct, linear relations in log(Sigma\_e) and log(Sigma\_1) vs. log(M). These structural relations exhibit slopes and scatter that remain almost constant with time while their normalizations decline. For SFGs, the normalization declines by less than a factor of 2 from z=3, in both Sigma\_e and Sigma\_1. Such mild declines suggest that SFGs build dense cores by growing along these relations. We define this evolution as the structural main sequence (Sigma-MS). Quiescent galaxies follow different relations (Sigma\^{}Q\_e, Sigma\^{}Q\_1) off the Sigma-MS by having higher densities than SFGs of the same mass and redshift. The normalization of Sigma\^{}Q\_e declines by a factor of 10 since z=3, but only a factor of 2 in Sigma\^{}Q\_1. Thus, the common denominator for quiescent galaxies at all redshifts is the presence of a dense stellar core, and the formation of such cores in SFGs is the main requirement for quenching. Expressed in 2D as deviations off the SFR-MS and off Sigma\^{}Q\_1 at each redshift, the distribution of massive galaxies forms a universal, L-shaped sequence that relates two fundamental physical processes: compaction and quenching. Compaction is a process of substantial core-growth in SFGs relative to that in the Sigma-MS. This process increases the core-to-total mass and Sersic index, thereby, making compact SFGs. Quenching occurs once compact SFGs reach a maximum central density above Sigma\^{}Q\_1 $\gt$ 9.5 M\_sun/kpc\^{}2. This threshold provides the most effective selection criterion to identify the star-forming progenitors of quiescent galaxies at all redshifts.},

We detect compact, star-forming galaxies (cSFGs) whose number densities, masses, sizes, and star formation rates (SFRs) qualify them as likely progenitors of compact, quiescent, massive galaxies (cQGs) at z = 1.5-3. At z $\gt$\~{} 2, cSFGs present SFR = 100-200 M $_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$, yet their specific star formation rates (sSFR \~{} 10$^{-9}$ yr$^{-1}$) are typically half that of other massive SFGs at the same epoch, and host X-ray luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs) 30 times (\~{}30\%) more frequently. These properties suggest that cSFGs are formed by gas-rich processes (mergers or disk-instabilities) that induce a compact starburst and feed an AGN, which, in turn, quench the star formation on dynamical timescales (few 10$^{8}$ yr). The cSFGs are continuously being formed at z = 2-3 and fade to cQGs down to z \~{} 1.5. After this epoch, cSFGs are rare, thereby truncating the formation of new cQGs. Meanwhile, down to z = 1, existing cQGs continue to enlarge to match local QGs in size, while less-gas-rich mergers and other secular mechanisms shepherd (larger) SFGs as later arrivals to the red sequence. In summary, we propose two evolutionary tracks of QG formation: an early (z $\gt$\~{} 2), formation path of rapidly quenched cSFGs fading into cQGs that later enlarge within the quiescent phase, and a late-arrival (z $\lt$\~{} 2) path in which larger SFGs form extended QGs without passing through a compact state.},

The optical/NIR and far-IR Spitzer/Herschel colors indicate that most compact SFGs are heavily obscured. Nearly half (47\%) host an X-ray-bright active galactic nucleus (AGN). In contrast, only about 10\% of other massive galaxies at that time host AGNs. Compact SFGs have centrally concentrated light profiles and spheroidal morphologies similar to quiescent galaxies and are thus strikingly different from other SFGs, which typically are disk-like and sometimes clumpy or irregular. Most compact SFGs lie either within the star formation rate (SFR)-mass main sequence (65\%) or below it (30\%), on the expected evolutionary path toward quiescent galaxies. These results show conclusively that galaxies become more compact before they lose their gas and dust, quenching star formation. Using extensive HST photometry from CANDELS and grism spectroscopy from the 3D-HST survey, we model their stellar populations with either exponentially declining ({$\tau$}) star formation histories (SFHs) or physically motivated SFHs drawn from semianalytic models (SAMs). SAMs predict longer formation timescales and older ages \~{}2 Gyr, which are nearly twice as old as the estimates of the {$\tau$} models. Both models yield good spectral energy distribution fits, indicating that the systematic uncertainty in the age due to degeneracies in the SFH is of that order of magnitude. However, SAM SFHs better match the observed slope and zero point of the SFR-mass main sequence. Contrary to expectations, some low-mass compact SFGs (log(M/M $_{⊙}$) =10-10.6) have younger ages but lower specific SFRs than that of more massive galaxies, suggesting that the low-mass galaxies reach the red sequence faster. If the progenitors of compact SFGs are extended SFGs, state-of-the-art SAMs show that mergers and disk instabilities (DIs) are both able to shrink galaxies, but DIs are more frequent (60\% versus 40\%) and form more concentrated galaxies. We confirm this result via high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations.},

The spatially resolved velocity map of the inner r {\lsim} 1 kpc reveals a continuous velocity gradient consistent with the kinematics of a rotating disk with v $_{rot}$(r = 1 kpc) = 163 {\plusmn} 5 km s$^{‑1}$ and v $_{rot}$/{$\sigma$} {\sim} 2.5. The gas-to-stellar ratios estimated from CO(8{\ndash}7) and the dust continuum emission span a broad range, f$_{gas}$$^{CO}$=M$_{gas}$/M$_{\star }$=13\%-45\% and f$_{gas}$$^{cont}$=50 \% -67\% , but are nonetheless consistent given the uncertainties in the conversion factors. The dynamical modeling yields a dynamical mass of log(M$_{dyn}$/M$_{⊙}$)=10.58$_{-0.2}$$^{+0.5}$,  which is lower, but still consistent with the baryonic mass, log(M$_{bar}$=M$_{\star}$+M$_{gas}$$^{CO}$/M$_{⊙}$)=11.0, if the smallest CO-based gas fraction is assumed. Despite a low, overall gas fraction, the small physical extent of the dense, star-forming gas probed by CO(8{\ndash}7), {\sim}3{\times} smaller than the stellar size, implies a strong relative concentration that increases the gas fraction up to f$_{gas}$$^{CO}$,1 kpc{\sim} 85 \%  in the central 1 kpc. Such a gas-rich center, coupled with a high star formation rate (SFR) {\sim} 500 M $_{⊙}$ yr$^{‑1}$, suggests that GDS-14876 is quickly assembling a dense stellar component (bulge) in a strong nuclear starburst. Assuming its gas reservoir is depleted without replenishment, GDS-14876 will quickly (t $_{depl}$ {\sim} 27 Myr) become a compact quiescent galaxy that could retain some fraction of the observed rotational support.},

We find that throughout the explored redshift range the passive galaxies selected with our criteria have weak morphological K -correction, with size being slightly smaller in the optical than in the UV rest frame (by ~20% and ~10% at z > 1.2 and z < 1.2, respectively). We measure a significant evolution of the mass-size relation of ETGs, with a fractional increment that is almost independent of the stellar mass. ETGs formed at z > 1 appear to be preferentially small, and the evolution of the mass-size relation at z < 1 is driven by both the continuous size growth of the compact galaxies and the appearance of new ETGs with large sizes. We also find that the number density of all passive ETGs increases rapidly, by a factor of five, from z ~ 2 to z ~ 1, and then more mildly by another factor of 1.5 from z ~ 1 to z ~ 0. We interpret these results as evidence that the bulk of the ETGs are formed at 1 < z < 3 through a mechanism that leaves very compact remnants. At z < 1 the compact ETGs grow gradually in size, becoming normal-size galaxies, and at the same time new ETGs with normal-large sizes are formed.},

The evolution in number density of these extreme objects over cosmic time is the crucial constraining factor for the models of massive galaxy assembly. We select a large sample of ~200 intermediate-redshift massive compacts from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) spectroscopy by identifying point-like Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometric sources with spectroscopic signatures of evolved redshifted galaxies. A subset of our targets have publicly available high-resolution ground-based images that we use to augment the dynamical and stellar population properties of these systems by their structural parameters. We confirm that all BOSS compact candidates are as compact as their high-redshift massive counterparts and less than half the size of similarly massive systems at z ~ 0. We use the completeness-corrected numbers of BOSS compacts to compute lower limits on their number densities in narrow redshift bins spanning the range of our sample. The abundance of extremely dense quiescent galaxies at 0.2 < z < 0.6 is in excellent agreement with the number densities of these systems at high redshift. Our lower limits support the models of massive galaxy assembly through a series of minor mergers over the redshift range 0 < z < 2.},

  abstract = {We recently identified a substantial population of galaxies at z > 2 with comparatively red rest-frame optical colors. These distant red galaxies (DRGs) are efficiently selected by the simple observed color criterion J s - K s > 2.3. In this paper we present near-infrared spectroscopy with Keck NIRSPEC of six DRGs with previously measured redshifts 2.4 < z < 3.2, two of which were known to host an active nucleus. We detect continuum emission and emission lines of all observed galaxies. Equivalent widths of Hα in the nonactive galaxies are 20-30 Å, smaller than measured for Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and nearby luminous infrared galaxies and comparable to normal nearby galaxies. The modest equivalent widths imply that the galaxies either have a decreasing star formation rate or are very dusty. Fitting both the photometry and the Hα lines, we find continuum extinction A V = 1-2 mag, ages 1-2.5 Gyr, star formation rates 200-400 M ☉ yr -1 , and stellar masses (1-5) × 10 11 M ☉ for models with constant star formation rates. Models with a declining star formation lead to significantly lower extinction, star formation rates, and ages but similar stellar masses. From [N II ]/Hα ratios we infer that the metallicities are high, 1-1.5 times solar. For four galaxies we can determine line widths from the optical emission lines. The widths are high, ranging from 130 to 240 km s -1 , and by combining data for LBGs and DRGs, we find significant correlations between line width and rest-frame U - V color and between line width and stellar mass. The latter correlation has a similar slope and offset as the "baryonic Tully-Fisher relation" for nearby galaxies. From the line widths and effective radii we infer dynamical masses and mass-to-light ( M / L ) ratios. The median dynamical mass is ~2 × 10 11 M ☉ , supporting the high stellar masses inferred from the photometry. We find that the median M / L V ≈ 0.8( M / L ) ☉ , a factor of ~5 higher than measured for LBGs. We infer from our small sample that DRGs are dustier, more metal-rich, and more massive and have higher ages than z ≈ 3 LBGs of the same rest-frame V -band luminosity. Although their volume density is still uncertain, their high M / L ratios imply that they contribute significantly to the stellar mass density at z ≈ 2.5. As their stellar masses are comparable to those of early-type galaxies, they may have already assembled most of their final mass.},

Our fast rotating lenticular disk galaxies with bulge magnitudes M V ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} –21.30 mag have central stellar deficits, suggesting that these bulges may have formed from "dry" merger events involving supermassive black holes (BHs) while their surrounding disk was subsequently built up, perhaps via cold gas accretion scenarios. The central stellar mass deficits M def are roughly 0.5-2 M BH (BH mass), rather than ~10-20 M BH as claimed from some past studies, which is in accord with core-Sérsic model mass deficit measurements in elliptical galaxies. Furthermore, these bulges have Sérsic indices n ~3, half-light radii R e 10 11 M ☉ , and therefore appear to be descendants of the compact galaxies reported at z ~ 1.5-2. Past studies which have searched for these local counterparts by using single-component galaxy models to provide the z ~ 0 size comparisons have overlooked these dense, compact, and massive bulges in today's early-type disk galaxies. This evolutionary scenario not only accounts for what are today generally old bulges—which must be present in z ~ 1.5 images—residing in what are generally young disks, but it eliminates the uncomfortable suggestion of a factor of three to five growth in size for the compact, z ~ 1.5 galaxies that are known to possess infant disks.},

We also find that cSFGs have distributions similar to cQGs on the nonparametric morphology diagrams. The cQGs and cSFGs have larger Gini and smaller M 20 , while eSFGs have the reverse. About one-third of cSFGs show signatures of postmergers, and almost none of them can be recognized as disks. Moreover, those visually extended cSFGs all have lower Gini coefficients ( Gini < 0.4), indicating that the Gini coefficient could be used to clean out noncompact galaxies in a sample of candidate cSFGs. The X-ray-detected counterparts are more frequent among cSFGs than in eSFGs and cQGs, implying that cSFGs have previously experienced violent gas-richinteractions (such as major mergers or disk instabilities), which could trigger both star formation and black hole growth in an active phase.},

These cSFGs are likely the direct progenitors of the compact quiescent galaxies observed at this epoch, which are the first population of passive galaxies to appear in large numbers in the early Universe. We identify cSFGs that host an AGN using a combination of Hubble WFC3 imaging and Chandra X-ray observations in four fields: the Chandra Deep Fields, the Extended Groth Strip, and the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey field. We find that $\{$39.2$\}$$_{-3.6}$$^{+3.9}$ \%  (65/166) of cSFGs at 1.4$\lt$ z$\lt$ 3.0 host an X-ray detected AGN. This fraction is 3.2 times higher than the incidence of AGN in extended star-forming galaxies with similar masses at these redshifts. This difference is significant at the 6.2{$\sigma$}  level. Our results are consistent with models in which cSFGs are formed through a dissipative contraction that triggers a compact starburst and concurrent growth of the central black hole. We also discuss our findings in the context of cosmological galaxy evolution simulations that require feedback energy to rapidly quench cSFGs. We show that the AGN fraction peaks precisely where energy injection is needed to reproduce the decline in the number density of cSFGs with redshift. Our results suggest that the first abundant population of massive quenched galaxies emerged directly following a phase of elevated supermassive black hole growth and further hints at a possible connection between AGN and the rapid quenching of star formation in these galaxies.},

The emission-line galaxies are classified by the nature of their ionized emission; there are six star-forming galaxies and four galaxies hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The star-forming galaxies are the largest among the emission-line galaxies, with a median size of r e = 2.8 kpc. The three galaxies with the highest star formation rates ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 100 M ☉ yr –1 ) have irregular and clumpy morphologies. The AGN host galaxies are more similar to the compact quiescent galaxies in terms of their structures ( r e ~ 1.1 kpc) and spectral energy distributions. The total sample clearly separates into two classes in a color-mass diagram: the large star-forming galaxies that form the blue cloud, and the compact quiescent galaxies on the red sequence. However, it is unclear how or even if the two classes are evolutionary related. Three out of six massive star-forming galaxies have dense cores and thus may passively evolve into compact galaxies due to fading of outer star-forming regions. For these galaxies, a reverse scenario in which compact galaxies grow inside-out by star formation is also plausible. We do caution though that the sample is small. Nonetheless, it is evident that a Hubble sequence of massive galaxies with strongly correlated galaxy properties is already in place at z > 2.},

  abstract = {Several recent studies have shown that about half of the massive galaxies at z ~ 2 are in a quiescent phase. Moreover, these galaxies are commonly found to be ultra-compact with half-light radii of ~1 kpc. We have obtained a ~29 hr spectrum of a typical quiescent, ultra-dense galaxy at z = 2.1865 with the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph. The spectrum exhibits a strong optical break and several absorption features, which have not previously been detected in z > 2 quiescent galaxies. Comparison of the spectral energy distribution with stellar population synthesis models implies a low star formation rate (SFR) of 1-3 M ☉ yr –1 , an age of 1.3-2.2 Gyr, and a stellar mass of ~2 × 10 11 M ☉ . We detect several faint emission lines, with emission-line ratios of[N II ]/Hα, [S II ]/Hα, and[O II]/[O III ] typical of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions. Thus, neither the stellar continuum nor the nebular emission implies active star formation. The current SFR is <1% of the past average SFR. If this galaxy is representative of compact quiescent galaxies beyond z = 2, it implies that quenching of star formation is extremely efficient and also indicates that low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) could be common in these objects. Nuclear emission is a potential concern for the size measurement. However, we show that the AGN contributes ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 8% to the rest-frame optical emission. A possible post-starburst population may affect size measurements more strongly; although a 0.5 Gyr old stellar population can make up ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 10% of the total stellar mass, it could account for up to ~40% of the optical light. Nevertheless, this spectrum shows that this compact galaxy is dominated by an evolved stellar population.},

  abstract = {Recent observations show evidence that high-z (z {\tilde} 2-3) early-type galaxies (ETGs) are more compact than those with comparable mass at z {\tilde} 0. Such size evolution is most likely explained by the `dry merger sceanario'. However, previous studies based on this scenario cannot consistently explain the properties of both high-z compact massive ETGs and local ETGs. We investigate the effect of multiple sequential dry minor mergers on the size evolution of compact massive ETGs. From an analysis of the Millennium Simulation Data Base, we show that such minor (stellar mass ratio M$_{2}$/M$_{1}$ $\lt$ 1/4) mergers are extremely common during hierarchical structure formation. We perform N-body simulations of sequential minor mergers with parabolic and head-on orbits, including a dark matter component and a stellar component. Typical mass ratios of these minor mergers are 1/20 $\lt$ M$_{2}$/M$_{1}$ {\le}q 1/10. We show that sequential minor mergers of compact satellite galaxies are the most efficient at promoting size growth and decreasing the velocity dispersion of compact massive ETGs in our simulations. The change of stellar size and density of the merger remnants is consistent with recent observations. Furthermore, we construct the merger histories of candidates for high-z compact massive ETGs using the Millennium Simulation Data Base and estimate the size growth of the galaxies through the dry minor merger scenario. We can reproduce the mean size growth factor between z = 2 and z = 0, assuming the most efficient size growth obtained during sequential minor mergers in our simulations. However, we note that our numerical result is only valid for merger histories with typical mass ratios between 1/20 and 1/10 with parabolic and head-on orbits and that our most efficient size-growth efficiency is likely an upper limit.},

The majority of the observed galaxies are emission-line systems, while a significant fraction (23%-34%) appear to be normal ellipticals or otherwise early-type systems. One object is an active galactic nucleus, and two are at high redshift ( z > 2). The Keck redshift and photometric data are combined with Hubble Space Telescope images to derive luminosities and physical sizes. We also use emission-line widths, where available, to estimate masses. About two-thirds of the emission-line galaxies, or roughly one-half the sample, are small, low-mass, relatively luminous systems with properties resembling those of local H II galaxies. We compare the properties and numbers of these galaxies to the "bursting dwarf" model of Babul & Ferguson.

The number of galaxies fitting the model parameters are lower by a factor of 2-3 than predicted. An examination of samples used in analyses of disk surface brightness at redshifts z > 0.5 shows that compact galaxies are likely to contribute to the strong disk luminosity evolution found in some studies. Estimates of comoving volume densities indicate that the population of apparent H II galaxies evolves rapidly from redshifts of z ~ 1 to the present. It appears that not all of these galaxies can be progenitors of present-day spheroidal galaxies, although the numbers of them with sizes and masses comparable to spheroidals is not dissimilar to estimates of the local field spheroidal density. We also present 51 additional redshifts, acquired for other projects during the same observing period, for a total of 105 objects with identified redshifts z < 2 in the Hubble Deep Field and its flanking fields.},

As is typical for cSFGs, this galaxy has a stellar mass of 1.89 {\plusmn} 0.47 {\times} 10$^{11}$M$_{⊙}$, with a star formation rate (SFR) of 214 {\plusmn} 44 M$_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$ putting it on the star-forming ``main-sequence'', but with an H-band effective radius of 2.5 kpc, making it much smaller than the bulk of ``main-sequence'' star-forming galaxies. The intensity ratio of the line detections yield an ISM density (  6 {\times} 10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$) and a UV-radiation field (  2 {\times} 10$^{4}$G$_{0}$), similar to the values in local starburst and ultra-luminous infrared galaxy environments. A starburst phase is consistent with the short depletion times (t$_{H2,dep}$ {\le} 140 Myr) we find in 3D-HST GS30274 using three different proxies for the H$_{2}$ mass ([CI], CO, dust mass). This depletion time is significantly shorter than in more extended SFGs with similar stellar masses and SFRs. Moreover, the gas fraction of 3D-HST GS30274 is smaller than typically found in extended galaxies. We measure the CO and [CI] kinematics and find a FWHM line width of   750 {\plusmn} 41 km s$^{-1}$. The CO and [CI] FWHM are consistent with a previously measured H{$\alpha$} FWHM for this source. The line widths are consistent with gravitational motions, suggesting we are seeing a compact molecular gas reservoir. A previous merger event, as suggested by the asymmetric light profile, may be responsible for the compact distribution of gas and has triggered a central starburst event. This event gives rise to the starburst-like ISM properties and short depletion times in 3D-HST GS30274. The centrally located and efficient star formation is quickly building up a dense core of stars, responsible for the compact distribution of stellar light in 3D-HST GS30274.},

The total number of massive galaxies at z > 3 is consistent with the number of massive, quiescent galaxies (MQGs) at z ~ 2, implying that the SFRs for all of these galaxies must be much lower by z ~ 2. We discover four CMQGs at z > 3, pushing back the time for which such galaxies have been observed. However, the volume density for these galaxies is significantly less than that of galaxies at z < 2 with similar masses, SFRs, and sizes, implying that additional CMQGs must be created in the intervening ~1 Gyr between z = 3 and z = 2. We find five star-forming galaxies at z ~ 3 that are compact ( R e 10 10.6 M ☉ ; these galaxies are likely to become members of the massive, quiescent, compact galaxy population at z ~ 2. We evolve the stellar masses and SFRs of each individual z > 3 galaxy adopting five different star formation histories (SFHs) and studying the resulting population of massive galaxies at z = 2.3. We find that declining or truncated SFHs are necessary to match the observed number density of MQGs at z ~ 2, whereas a constant delayed-exponential SFH would result in a number density significantly smaller than observed. All of our assumed SFHs imply number densities of CMQGs at z ~ 2 that are consistent with the observed number density. Better agreement with the observed number density of CMQGs at z ~ 2 is obtained if merging is included in the analysis and better still if star formation quenching is assumed to shortly follow the merging event, as implied by recent models of the formation of MQGs.},

The observed spectral energy distributions show pronounced breaks, sampled by a set of near-IR medium-bandwidth filters, resulting in tightly constrained photometric redshifts. Fitting stellar population models suggests large Balmer/4000 Å breaks, relatively old stellar populations, large stellar masses, and low SFRs, with a median specific SFR of 2.9 ± 1.8 × 10 –11 yr –1 . Ultradeep Herschel /PACS 100 μm, 160 μm and Spitzer /MIPS 24 μm data reveal no dust-obscured SFR activity for 15/19(79%) galaxies. Two far-IR detected galaxies are obscured QSOs. Stacking the far-IR undetected galaxies yields no detection, consistent with the spectral energy distribution fit, indicating independently that the average specific SFR is at least 10 × smaller than that of typical star-forming galaxies at z ~ 4. Assuming all far-IR undetected galaxies are indeed quiescent, the volume density is 1.8 ± 0.7 × 10 –5 Mpc –3 to a limit of log 10 M / M ☉ ≥ 10.6, which is 10 × and 80 × lower than at z = 2 and z = 0.1. They comprise a remarkably high fraction (~35%) of z ~ 4 massive galaxies, suggesting that suppression of star formation was efficient even at very high redshift. Given the average stellar age of 0.8 Gyr and stellar mass of 0.8 × 10 11 M ☉ , the galaxies likely started forming stars before z = 5, with SFRs well in excess of 100 M ☉ yr –1 , far exceeding that of similarly abundant UV-bright galaxies at z ≥ 4. This suggests that most of the star formation in the progenitors of quiescent z ~ 4 galaxies was obscured by dust.},

These massive galaxies are at least a factor of 4$^{+1.9}$$_{-1.0}$ (+/-1{$\sigma$}) smaller in the rest-frame V-band than local counterparts of the same stellar mass. Consequently, the stellar mass density of these objects is (at least) 60 times larger than that of massive ellipticals today. Although the stellar populations of these objects are passively fading, their structural properties are rapidly changing since that redshift. This observational fact disagrees with a scenario where the more massive and passive galaxies are fully assembled at z \~{} 1.4 (i.e. a monolithic scenario) and points towards a dry merger scenario as the responsible mechanism for the subsequent evolution of these galaxies.},

We use very deep near-infrared images of the Hubble Deep Field-South and the MS 1054-03 field in the J s , H , and K s bands from FIRES to retrieve the sizes in the optical rest frame for galaxies with z > 1. We combine our results with those from GEMS at 0.2 < z < 1 and SDSS at z ~ 0.1 to achieve a comprehensive picture of the optical rest-frame size evolution from z = 0 to 3. Galaxies are differentiated according to their light concentration using the Sérsic index n . For less concentrated objects, the galaxies at a given luminosity were typically ~3 ± 0.5 (±2 σ) times smaller at z ~ 2.5 than those we see today. The stellar mass-size relation has evolved less: the mean size at a given stellar mass was ~2 ± 0.5 times smaller at z ~ 2.5, evolving proportionally to (1 + z ) -0.40±0.06 . Simple scaling relations between dark matter halos and baryons in a hierarchical cosmogony predict a stronger (although consistent within the error bars) than observed evolution of the stellar mass-size relation. The observed luminosity-size evolution out to z ~ 2.5 matches well recent infall model predictions for Milky Way-type objects. For low- n galaxies, the evolution of the stellar mass-size relation would follow naturally if the individual galaxies grow inside out. For highly concentrated objects, the situation is as follows: at a given luminosity, these galaxies were ~2.7 ± 1.1 times smaller at z ~ 2.5 (or, put differently, were typically ~2.2 ± 0.7 mag brighter at a given size than they are today), and at a given stellar mass the size has evolved proportionally to (1 + z ) -0.45±0.10 .},

In agreement with previous work, their half-light radii are <2 kpc, much smaller than equally massive galaxies in the present-day universe. A significant subset of the sample appears highly flattened in projection, which implies, considering viewing angle statistics, that a significant fraction of the galaxies in our sample have pronounced disks. This is corroborated by two-dimensional surface brightness profile fits. We estimate that 65% ± 15% of the population of massive, quiescent z ~ 2 galaxies are disk dominated. The median disk scale length is 1.5 kpc, substantially smaller than the disks of equally massive galaxies in the present-day universe. Our results provide strong observational evidence that the much-discussed ultra-dense high-redshift galaxies should generally be thought of as disk-like stellar systems with the majority of stars formed from gas that had time to settle into a disk.},

We find a large population of massive young recently quenched ("post-starburst") galaxies at z > 1 that are almost non-existent at z < 1; their number density is 5 × 10 –5 Mpc –3 at z = 2, whereas it is a factor of 10 less at z = 0.5. The observed number densities of young and old quiescent galaxies at z > 1 are consistent with a simple model in which all old quiescent galaxies were once identified as post-starburst galaxies. We find that the overall population of quiescent galaxies have smaller sizes and slightly more elongated shapes at higher redshift, in agreement with other recent studies. Interestingly, the most recently quenched galaxies at 1 < z < 2 are not larger, and possibly even smaller, than older galaxies at those redshifts. This result is inconsistent with the idea that the evolution of the average size of quiescent galaxies is largely driven by continuous transformations of larger, star-forming galaxies: in that case, the youngest quiescent galaxies would also be the largest. Instead, mergers or other mechanisms appear to be required to explain the size growth of quiescent galaxies from z = 2 to the present.},

  abstract = {We use GOODS and CANDELS images to identify progenitors of massive ( M > 10 10 M ☉ ) compact early-type galaxies (ETGs) at z ~ 1.6. Because merging and accretion increase the size of the stellar component of galaxies, if the progenitors are among known star-forming galaxies, these must be compact themselves. We select candidate progenitors among compact Lyman-break galaxies at z ~ 3 on the basis of their mass, star-formation rate (SFR), and central stellar density, and we find that these account for a large fraction of, and possibly all, compact ETGs at z ~ 1.6. We find that the average far-UV spectral energy distribution (SED) of the candidates is redder than that of the non-candidates, but the optical and mid-IR SED are the same, implying that the redder UV of the candidates is inconsistent with larger dust obscuration and consistent with more evolved (aging) star formation. This is in line with other evidence suggesting that compactness is a sensitive predictor of passivity among high-redshift massive galaxies. We also find that the light distribution of both the compact ETGs and their candidate progenitors does not show any extended "halos" surrounding the compact "core,"both in individual images and in stacks. We argue that this is generally inconsistent with the morphology of merger remnants, even if gas rich, as predicted by N -body simulations. This suggests that the compact ETGs formed via highly dissipative, mostly gaseous accretion of units whose stellar components are very small and undetected in the Hubble Space Telescope images, with their stellar mass assembling in situ, and that they have not experienced any major merging until the epoch of observations at z ~ 1.6.},

  abstract      = {The origin of ultracompact dwarfs (UCDs), a class of compact stellar systems discovered two decades ago, still remains a matter of debate. Recent discoveries of central supermassive black holes in UCDs likely inherited from their massive progenitor galaxies provide support for the tidal stripping hypothesis. At the same time, on statistical grounds, some massive UCDs might be representatives of the high luminosity tail of the globular cluster luminosity function. Here we present a detection of a $3.3^{+1.4}\_{-1.2}\times10^6\,M\_{\odot}$ black hole ($1\sigma$ uncertainty) in the centre of the UCD3 galaxy in the Fornax cluster, that corresponds to 4 per cent of its stellar mass. We performed isotropic Jeans dynamical modelling of UCD3 using internal kinematics derived from adaptive optics assisted observations with the SINFONI spectrograph and seeing limited data collected with the FLAMES spectrograph at the ESO VLT. We rule out the zero black hole mass at the $3\sigma$ confidence level when adopting a mass-to-light ratio inferred from stellar populations. This is the fourth supermassive black hole found in a UCD and the first one in the Fornax cluster. Similarly to other known UCDs that harbour black holes, UCD3 hosts metal rich stars enhanced in $\alpha$-elements that supports the tidal stripping of a massive progenitor as its likely formation scenario. We estimate that up to 80 per cent of luminous UCDs in galaxy clusters host central black holes. This fraction should be lower for UCDs in groups, because their progenitors are more likely to be dwarf galaxies, which do not tend to host central black holes.},

We use the multi-band HST imaging to create a mass model that suggests and accounts for the presence of multiple stellar populations and structural components. We combine these mass models with kinematics measurements from Gemini/NIFS to find a best-fit stellar mass-to-light ratio ($M/L$) and black hole (BH) mass using Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM), axisymmetric Schwarzschild models, and triaxial Schwarzschild models. The best fit parameters in the JAM and axisymmetric Schwarzschild models have black holes between 2.5 and 5.9 million solar masses. The triaxial Schwarzschild models point toward a similar BH mass, but show a minimum $\chi^2$ at a BH mass of $\sim 0$. Models with a BH in all three techniques provide better fits to the central $V\_{rms}$ profiles, and thus we estimate the BH mass to be $4.2^{+2.1}\_{-1.7} \times 10^{6}$ M$\_\odot$ (estimated 1$\sigma$ uncertainties). We also present deep radio imaging of M59-UCD3 and two other UCDs in Virgo with dynamical BH mass measurements, and compare these to X-ray measurements to check for consistency with the fundamental plane of BH accretion. We detect faint radio emission in M59cO, but find only upper limits for M60-UCD1 and M59-UCD3 despite X-ray detections in both these sources. The BH mass and nuclear light profile of M59-UCD3 suggests it is the tidally stripped remnant of a $\sim$10$^{9-10}$ M$\_\odot$ galaxy.},

The literature UCDs, located in lower-density environments than M87, extend to younger ages and smaller [$\alpha$/Fe] (at given metallicities) than M87 UCDs, resembling the environmental dependence of the Virgo dE nuclei. The UCDs exhibit a positive mass-metallicity relation (MZR), which flattens and connects compact ellipticals at stellar masses $\gtrsim$ 10$^{8}$ $M\_{\odot}$. The Virgo dE nuclei largely follow the average MZR of UCDs, whereas most of the M87 GCs are offset towards higher metallicities for given stellar masses. The difference between the mass-metallicity distributions of UCDs and GCs may be qualitatively understood as a result of their different physical sizes at birth in a self-enrichment scenario or of galactic nuclear cluster star formation efficiency being relatively low in a tidal stripping scenario for UCD formation. The existing observations provide the necessary but not sufficient evidence for tidally stripped dE nuclei being the dominant contributors to the M87 UCDs.},

  abstract      = {We investigate the structural properties of the underlying hosts of 34 blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies with deep near-infrared (NIR) photometry. The BCD sample is selected from the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey in the Great observatories origins Deep Survey North and South fields. We extract the surface brightness profile (SBP) in the optical F435W and NIR F160W bands. The SBPs of BCDs in the H band reach {\tilde}26 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ at the 3{$\sigma$} level, which is so far the deepest NIR imaging of BCDs. Then we fit the SBPs with one- and two-component S{\'e}rsic models. About half of the BCDs favour the two-component model which significantly improves the fit quality. The effective radii of the underlying hosts of BCDs in the B band are smaller than those of early-type dwarfs (dEs) and dwarf irregulars at a fixed luminosity. This discrepancy is similar to findings in many previous works. However, the difference in structural parameters between BCDs and other dwarf galaxies seems to be less significant in the H band. Furthermore, we find a remarkable agreement between the underlying hosts of BCDs and dEs. All dwarf galaxies seem to follow a similar luminosity-radius relationship which suggests a unified structural evolution for dwarf galaxies. We conclude that a possible evolution track from BCDs to dEs cannot be ruled out, with no significant change of structure needed in the evolutionary scenario.},

Our sample contains 164 galaxies down to stellar mass (M*) of $10^{8.5} M\_\odot$ in the CANDELS GOODS-N region, where Team Keck Redshift Survey DEIMOS spectroscopy and HST/WFC3 F275W images from CANDELS and Hubble Deep UV Legacy Survey are available. When the $\{$$\backslash$it ratio$\}$ of H$\beta$- and FUV-derived SFRs is measured, dust extinction correction is negligible (except for very dusty galaxies) with the Calzetti attenuation curve. The H$\beta$--to--FUV ratio of our sample increases with M* and SFR. The median ratio is $\sim$0.7 at M*$\sim10^{8.5} M\_\odot$ (or SFR$\sim 0.5 M\_\odot/yr$) and increases to $\sim$1 at M*$\sim10^{10} M\_\odot$ (or SFR $\sim 10 M\_\odot/yr$). At M*$\lt10^{9.5} M\_\odot$, our median H$\beta$--to--FUV ratio is lower than that of local galaxies at the same M*, implying a redshift evolution. Bursty SFH on a timescale of a few tens of megayears on galactic scales provides a plausible explanation of our results, and the importance of the burstiness increases as M* decreases. Due to sample selection effects, our H$\beta$--to--FUV ratio may be an upper limit of the true value of a complete sample, which strengthens our conclusions. Other models, e.g., non-universal initial mass function or stochastic star formation on star cluster scales, are unable to plausibly explain our results.},

We utilize the exceptional depth and area of the latest UltraVISTA data release, combined with the depth and unparalleled seeing of CANDELS to gather a large, mass-selected sample of galaxies in the NIR (rest-frame optical to UV).

We measure the stellar mass, star formation rate, and dust extinction for galaxy inner and outer regions via spatially-resolved spectral energy distribution fitting based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. By comparing specific star formation rates (sSFRs) between inner and outer parts of the galaxies we find that the majority of galaxies with the high central mass densities show evidence for a preferentially lower sSFR in their centers than in their outer regions, indicative of reduced sSFRs in their central regions. We also study galaxies at z \~{} 5 and 6 (here limited to high spatial resolution in the rest-frame ultraviolet only), finding that they show sSFRs which are generally independent of radial distance from the center of the galaxies. This indicates that stars are formed uniformly at all radii in massive galaxies at z \~{} 5 - 6, contrary to massive galaxies at z $\lt$ 4.},

This is performed using the strength of the Balmer break feature at rest-frame 3648 Å, which is a diagnostic of the age of the stellar population in galaxies. Using the WFC3 H -band-selected catalog for the CANDELS GOODS-S field and deep multi-waveband photometry from optical ( HST ) to mid-infrared ( Spitzer ) wavelengths, we identify a population of old and evolved post-starburst galaxies based on the strength of their Balmer breaks (Balmer break galaxies, BBGs). The galaxies are also selected to be bright in rest-frame near-IR wavelengths and hence massive. We identify a total of 16 BBGs. Fitting the spectral energy distribution of the BBGs shows that the candidate galaxies have average estimated ages of ~800 Myr and average stellar masses of ~5 × 10 10 M ☉ , consistent with being old and massive systems. Two of our BBG candidates are also identified by the criteria that are sensitive to star-forming galaxies (Lyman break galaxy selection). We find a number density of ~3.2 × 10 –5 Mpc –3 for the BBGs, corresponding to a mass density of ~2.0 × 10 6 M ☉ Mpc –3 in the redshift range covering the survey. Given the old age and the passive evolution, it is argued that some of these objects formed the bulk of their mass only a few hundred million years after the big bang.},

Previous studies have found galaxies with high gas velocity dispersions or small apparent sizes, but so far no objects have been identified with both the stellar structure and the gas dynamics of a forming core. Here we report a candidate core in the process of formation 11 billion years ago, at redshift z = 2.3. This galaxy, GOODS-N-774, has a stellar mass of 100 billion solar masses, a half-light radius of 1.0 kiloparsecs and a star formation rate of  solar masses per year. The star-forming gas has a velocity dispersion of 317 +/- 30 kilometres per second. This is similar to the stellar velocity dispersions of the putative descendants of GOODS-N-774, which are compact quiescent galaxies at z \~{} 2 (refs 8, 9, 10, 11) and giant elliptical galaxies in the nearby Universe. Galaxies such as GOODS-N-774 seem to be rare; however, from the star formation rate and size of this galaxy we infer that many star-forming cores may be heavily obscured, and could be missed in optical and near-infrared surveys.},

Among the 28 sBzKs observed, H{$\alpha$} emission was detected in 14 objects, and for 11 of them the [N II] {$\lambda$}6583 flux was also measured. Multiwavelength photometry was also used to derive stellar masses and extinction parameters, whereas H{$\alpha$} and [N II] emissions have allowed us to estimate star formation rates (SFRs), metallicities, ionization mechanisms, and dynamical masses. In order to enforce agreement between SFRs from H{$\alpha$} with those derived from rest-frame UV and mid-infrared, additional obscuration for the emission lines (that originate in H II regions) was required compared to the extinction derived from the slope of the UV continuum. We have also derived the stellar mass-metallicity relation, as well as the relation between stellar mass and specific SFR (SSFR), and compared them to the results in other studies. At a given stellar mass, the sBzKs appear to have been already enriched to metallicities close to those of local star-forming galaxies of similar mass. The sBzKs presented here tend to have higher metallicities compared to those of UV-selected galaxies, indicating that near-infrared selected galaxies tend to be a chemically more evolved population. The sBzKs show SSFRs that are systematically higher, by up to \~{}2 orders of magnitude, compared to those of local galaxies of the same mass. The empirical correlations between stellar mass and metallicity, and stellar mass and SSFR are then compared with those of evolutionary population synthesis models constructed either with the simple closed-box assumption, or within an infall scenario. Within the assumptions that are built-in such models, it appears that a short timescale for the star formation (sime100 Myr) and large initial gas mass appear to be required if one wants to reproduce both relations simultaneously.  Based on data collected at the Subaru telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (S04A-081, S05A-098), and on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Paranal, Chile (075.A-0439).},

  abstract      = {Accurate measurements of galaxy masses and sizes are key to tracing galaxy evolution over time. Cosmological zoom-in simulations provide an ideal test bed for assessing the recovery of galaxy properties from observations. Here, we utilize galaxies with $M\_*\sim10^{10}-10^{11.5}M\_{\odot}$ at z\~{}1.7-2 from the MassiveFIRE cosmological simulation suite, part of the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. Using mock multi-band images, we compare intrinsic galaxy masses and sizes to observational estimates. We find that observations accurately recover stellar masses, with a slight average underestimate of \~{}0.06 dex and a \~{}0.15 dex scatter. Recovered half-light radii agree well with intrinsic half-mass radii when averaged over all viewing angles, with a systematic offset of \~{}0.1 dex (with the half-light radii being larger) and a scatter of \~{}0.2 dex. When using color gradients to account for mass-to-light variations, recovered half-mass radii also exceed the intrinsic half-mass radii by \~{}0.1 dex. However, if not properly accounted for, aperture effects can bias size estimates by \~{}0.1 dex. No differences are found between the mass and size offsets for star-forming and quiescent galaxies. Variations in viewing angle are responsible for \~{}25\% of the scatter in the recovered masses and sizes. Our results thus suggest that the intrinsic scatter in the mass-size relation may have previously been overestimated by \~{}25\%. Moreover, orientation-driven scatter causes the number density of very massive galaxies to be overestimated by \~{}0.5 dex at $M\_*\sim10^{11.5}M\_{\odot}$.},

  abstract      = {At redshift z{\thinsp}={\thinsp}2, when the Universe was just three billion years old, half of the most massive galaxies were extremely compact and had already exhausted their fuel for star formation. It is believed that they were formed in intense nuclear starbursts and that they ultimately grew into the most massive local elliptical galaxies seen today, through mergers with minor companions, but validating this picture requires higher-resolution observations of their centres than is currently possible. Magnification from gravitational lensing offers an opportunity to resolve the inner regions of galaxies. Here we report an analysis of the stellar populations and kinematics of a lensed z{\thinsp}={\thinsp}2.1478 compact galaxy, which{\mdash}surprisingly{\mdash}turns out to be a fast-spinning, rotationally supported disk galaxy. Its stars must have formed in a disk, rather than in a merger-driven nuclear starburst. The galaxy was probably fed by streams of cold gas, which were able to penetrate the hot halo gas until they were cut off by shock heating from the dark matter halo. This result confirms previous indirect indications that the first galaxies to cease star formation must have gone through major changes not just in their structure, but also in their kinematics, to evolve into present-day elliptical galaxies.},

  abstract      = {We introduce a new color-selection technique to identify high-redshift, massive galaxies that are systematically missed by Lyman-break selection. The new selection is based on the H\_$\{$160$\}$ and IRAC 4.5um bands, specifically H - [4.5] $\gt$ 2.25 mag. These galaxies, dubbed ``HIEROs'', include two major populations that can be separated with an additional J - H color. The populations are massive and dusty star-forming galaxies at z $\gt$ 3 (JH-blue) and extremely dusty galaxies at z $\lt$ 3 (JH-red). The 350 arcmin\^{}2 of the GOODS-N and GOODS-S fields with the deepest HST/WFC3 and IRAC data contain 285 HIEROs down to [4.5] $\lt$ 24 mag. We focus here primarily on JH-blue (z $\gt$ 3) HIEROs, which have a median photometric redshift z \~{}4.4 and stellar massM\_$\{$*$\}$\~{}10\^{}$\{$10.6$\}$ Msun, and are much fainter in the rest-frame UV than similarly massive Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs). Their star formation rates (SFRs) reaches \~{}240 Msun yr\^{}$\{$-1$\}$ leading to a specific SFR, sSFR \~{}4.2 Gyr\^{}$\{$-1$\}$, suggesting that the sSFRs for massive galaxies continue to grow at z $\gt$ 2 but at a lower growth rate than from z=0 to z=2. With a median half-light radius of 2 kpc, including \~{}20\% as compact as quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts, JH-blue HIEROs represent perfect star-forming progenitors of the most massive (M\_$\{$*$\}$ $\gt$ 10\^{}$\{$11.2$\}$ Msun) compact quiescent galaxies at z \~{} 3 and have the right number density. HIEROs make up \~{}60\% of all galaxies with M\_$\{$*$\}$ $\gt$ 10\^{}$\{$10.5$\}$ Msun identified at z $\gt$ 3 from their photometric redshifts. This is five times more than LBGs with nearly no overlap between the two populations. While HIEROs make up 15-25\% of the total SFR density at z \~{} 4-5, they completely dominate the SFR density taking place in M\_$\{$*$\}$ $\gt$10\^{}$\{$10.5$\}$ Msun galaxies, and are therefore crucial to understanding the very early phase of massive galaxy formation.},

  abstract  = {Nearby galaxies come in two flavors: red quiescent galaxies (QGs) with old stellar populations, and blue young star-forming galaxies (SFGs). This color bimodality seems to be already in place at z = 2 - 3, presenting also strong correlations with size and morphology. Surprisingly, massive QGs at higher redshifts are \~{}5 times smaller than local, equal mass analogs. In contrast, most of the massive SFGs at these redshifts are still relatively large disks. The strong bimodality in both SFR and sizes indicates that some SFGs must experience strong structural transformations accompanied by a rapid truncation of the star-formation to match the observed properties of QGs. Using high-resolution HST/WFC3 F160W imaging from the CANDELS survey in GOODS-S and UDS, along with multi-wavelength ancillary data, we analyze stellar masses, SFRs and sizes of a sample of massive (M$_{*}$ $\gt$ 10$^{10}$ M $_{⊙}$) galaxies at z = 1.4 - 3.0 to identify a population of compact SFGs with similar structural properties as compact QGs at z\~{}2. We also find that the number density of QGs increases rapidly since z = 3. Among these, the number of compact QGs builds up first, and only at z $\lt$ 1.8 we do start finding a sizable number of extended QGs. This suggests that the bulk of these galaxies are assembled at late times by both continuous migration (quenching) of non-compact SFGs and size growth of cQGs. As a result of this growth, the population of cQGs disappears by z\~{}1. Simultaneously, we identify a population of compact SFGs (cSFGs) whose number density decreases steadily with time since z = 3.0, being almost completely absent at z $\lt$ 1.4. The number of cSFGs makes up less than 20\% of all massive SFGs, but they present similar number densities as cQGs down to z\~{}2, suggesting an evolutionary link between the two populations.},

We find that the rest-frame color distribution of these galaxies is bimodal at all redshifts out to z\~{}1. This bimodality permits a model-independent definition of red early-type galaxies and blue late-type galaxies at any given redshift. The colors of the blue peak become redder toward the present day, and the number density of blue luminous galaxies has dropped strongly since z\~{}1. Focusing on the red galaxies, we find that they populate a color-magnitude relation. Such red sequences have been identified in galaxy cluster environments, but our data show that such a sequence exists over this redshift range even when averaging over all environments. The mean color of the red galaxy sequence evolves with redshift in a way that is consistent with the aging of an ancient stellar population. The rest-frame B-band luminosity density in red galaxies evolves only mildly with redshift in a {$\Lambda$}-dominated cold dark matter universe. When we account for the change in stellar mass-to-light ratio implied by the redshift evolution in red galaxy colors, the COMBO-17 data indicate an increase in stellar mass on the red sequence by a factor of 2 since z\~{}1. The largest source of uncertainty is large-scale structure, implying that considerably larger surveys are necessary to further refine this result. We explore mechanisms that may drive this evolution in the red galaxy population, finding that both galaxy merging and truncation of star formation in some fraction of the blue star-forming population are required to fully explain the properties of these galaxies.},

  abstract      = {Type-III S0 galaxies present tight scaling relations between their surface brightness photometric and structural parameters. Several evolutionary models have been proposed for the formation of Type-III S0 galaxies but the observations of are usually limited to the local Universe. We study the evolution of the photometric and structural scaling relations found between the parameters of the surface brightness profiles in the rest-frame R-band of Type-III S0 galaxies with z and the possible differences between the rest-frame (B-R) colours of the inner and outer disc profiles. We make use of a sample of 14 Type-III E/S0--S0 galaxies at 0.2$\lt$z$\lt$0.6 to study if the correlations found in local Type-III S0 galaxies were present \~{}6 Gyr ago. We analyse the distribution of the surface brightness characteristic parameters as a function of the stellar mass and if there is a significant change with z. We also derive their rest-frame (B-R) colour profiles and we compare these results with the predictions from a grid of SSP models. We find that the inner and outer scale-lengths of Type-III S0 galaxies at 0.4$\lt$z$\lt$0.6 follow compatible trends and scaling relations with those observed in local S0 galaxies. We do not detect any significant differences between the location of Rbreak between z\~{}0.6 and z=0 for a fixed stellar mass of the object, whereas the surface brightness at the break radius is \~{}1.5 mag arcsec-2 dimmer in the local Universe than at z\~{}0.6 for a fixed stellar mass. In contrast to Type-II profiles, the Type-III surface brightness profiles of S0 galaxies present compatible Rbreak values and scaling relations during the last 6 Gyr. This result and the similarity of the colours of the inner and outer discs point to a highly scalable and stable formation process, probably more related to gravitational and dynamical processes than to the evolution of stellar populations (abridged).},

  abstract = {We report on a complete sample of seven luminous early-type galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF) with spectroscopic redshifts between 1.39 and 2.47, and to K AB < 23. Using the BzK selection criterion, we have preselected a set of objects over the UDF, which fulfill the photometric conditions for being passively evolving galaxies at z > 1.4. Low-resolution spectra of these objects have been extracted from the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) ACS grism data taken over the UDF by the Grism ACS Program for Extragalactic Science (GRAPES) project. Redshifts for the seven galaxies have been identified based on the UV feature at rest frame 2640 < λ < 2850 Å. This feature is mainly due to a combination of Fe II , Mg I , and Mg II absorptions, which are characteristic of stellar populations dominated by stars older than ~0.5 Gyr. The redshift identification and the passively evolving nature of these galaxies is further supported by the photometric redshifts and by the overall spectral energy distribution (SED), with the ultradeep HST ACS NICMOS imaging revealing compact morphologies typical of elliptical/early-type galaxies. From the SED we derive stellar masses of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {gtrsim} 10 11 M ☉ and ages of ~1 Gyr. Their space density at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lang.gif] {lang} z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rang.gif] {rang} = 1.7 appears to be roughly a factor of 2-3 smaller than that of their local counterparts, further supporting the notion that such massive and old galaxies are already ubiquitous at early cosmic times. Much smaller effective radii are derived for some of the objects, compared to local massive ellipticals, which may be due to morphological K -corrections, evolution, or the presence of a central pointlike source. Nuclear activity is indeed present in a subset of the galaxies, as revealed by the fact that they are hard X-ray sources, which suggests that active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity may have played a role in discontinuing star formation.},

The IMF is reasonably well constrained in the disk of the Milky Way but we have very little direct information on the form of the IMF in other galaxies and at earlier cosmic epochs. Here we report observations of the NaI doublet and the Wing-Ford molecular FeH band in the spectra of elliptical galaxies. These lines are strong in stars with masses less than 0.3M$_{solar}$ (where M$_{solar}$ is the mass of the Sun) and are weak or absent in all other types of stars. We unambiguously detect both signatures, consistent with previous studies that were based on data of lower signal-to-noise ratio. The direct detection of the light of low-mass stars implies that they are very abundant in elliptical galaxies, making up over 80\% of the total number of stars and contributing more than 60\% of the total stellar mass. We infer that the IMF in massive star-forming galaxies in the early Universe produced many more low-mass stars than the IMF in the Milky Way disk, and was probably slightly steeper than the Salpeter form in the mass range 0.1M$_{solar}$ to 1M$_{solar}$.},

  abstract = {It has been widely remarked that compact, massive, elliptical-like galaxies are abundant at high redshifts but exceedingly rare in the universe today, implying significant evolution such that their sizes at z ∼ 2 ± 0.6 have increased by factors of 3 to 6 to become today’s massive elliptical galaxies. These claims have been based on studies that measured the half-light radii of galaxies as though they are all single-component systems. Here we identify 21 spheroidal stellar systems within 90 Mpc that have half-light, major-axis radii ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/804/1/32/apj510732ieqn1.gif] {${{R}_{{\rm e}}}\lesssim 2$} kpc, stellar masses ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/804/1/32/apj510732ieqn2.gif] {$0.7\times {{10}^{11}}\lt {{M}_{*}}/\;{{M}_{\odot }}\lt 1.4\times {{10}^{11}}$} , and Sérsic indices typically around a value of n = 2–3. This abundance of compact, massive spheroids in our own backyard—with a number density of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/804/1/32/apj510732ieqn3.gif] {$6.9\times {{10}^{-6}}$} Mpc −3 (or 3.5 × 10 −5 Mpc −3 per unit dex −1 in stellar mass)—and with the same physical properties as the high-redshift galaxies, had been overlooked because they are encased in stellar disks that usually result in galaxy sizes notably larger than 2 kpc. Moreover, this number density is a lower limit because it has not come from a volume-limited sample. The actual density may be closer to 10 −4 , although further work is required to confirm this. We therefore conclude that not all massive “spheroids” have undergone dramatic structural and size evolution since z ∼ 2 ± 0.6. Given that the bulges of local early-type disk galaxies are known to consist of predominantly old stars that existed at z ∼ 2, it seems likely that some of the observed high-redshift spheroids did not increase in size by building (three-dimensional) triaxial envelopes as commonly advocated, and that the growth of (two-dimensional) disks has also been important over the past 9–11 billion years.},

  abstract = {New surface photometry of all known elliptical galaxies in the Virgo cluster is combined with published data to derive composite profiles of brightness, ellipticity, position angle, isophote shape, and color over large radius ranges. These provide enough leverage to show that Sérsic log I ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} r 1/ n functions fit the brightness profiles I ( r ) of nearly all ellipticals remarkably well over large dynamic ranges. Therefore, we can confidently identify departures from these profiles that are diagnostic of galaxy formation. Two kinds of departures are seen at small radii. All 10 of our ellipticals with total absolute magnitudes M VT ≤ –21.66 have cuspy cores—"missing light"—at small radii. Cores are well known and naturally scoured by binary black holes (BHs) formed in dissipationless ("dry") mergers. All 17 ellipticals with –21.54 ≤ M VT ≤ –15.53 do not have cores. We find a new distinct component in these galaxies: all coreless ellipticals in our sample have extra light at the center above the inward extrapolation of the outer Sérsic profile. In large ellipticals, the excess light is spatially resolved and resembles the central components predicted in numerical simulations of mergers of galaxies that contain gas. In the simulations, the gas dissipates, falls toward the center, undergoes a starburst, and builds a compact stellar component that, as in our observations, is distinct from the Sérsic-function main body of the elliptical. But ellipticals with extra light also contain supermassive BHs. We suggest that the starburst has swamped core scouring by binary BHs. That is, we interpret extra light components as a signature of formation in dissipative ("wet") mergers. Besides extra light, we find three new aspects to the ("E-E") dichotomy into two types of elliptical galaxies. Core galaxies are known to be slowly rotating, to have relatively anisotropic velocity distributions, and to have boxy isophotes. We show that they have Sérsic indices n > 4 uncorrelated with M VT . They also are α-element enhanced, implying short star-formation timescales. And their stellar populations have a variety of ages but mostly are very old. Extra light ellipticals generally rotate rapidly, are more isotropic than core Es, and have disky isophotes. We show that they have n ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sime.gif] {sime} 3 ± 1 almost uncorrelated with M VT and younger and less α-enhanced stellar populations. These are new clues to galaxy formation. We suggest that extra light ellipticals got their low Sérsic indices by forming in relatively few binary mergers, whereas giant ellipticals have n > 4 because they formed in larger numbers of mergers of more galaxies at once plus later heating during hierarchical clustering. We confirm that core Es contain X-ray-emitting gas whereas extra light Es generally do not. This leads us to suggest why the E-E dichotomy arose. If energy feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) requires a "working surface" of hot gas, then this is present in core galaxies but absent in extra light galaxies. We suggest that AGN energy feedback is a strong function of galaxy mass: it is weak enough in small Es not to prevent merger starbursts but strong enough in giant Es and their progenitors to make dry mergers dry and to protect old stellar populations from late star formation. Finally, we verify that there is a strong dichotomy between elliptical and spheroidal galaxies. Their properties are consistent with our understanding of their different formation processes: mergers for ellipticals and conversion of late-type galaxies into spheroidals by environmental effects and by energy feedback from supernovae. In an appendix, we develop machinery to get realistic error estimates for Sérsic parameters even when they are strongly coupled. And we discuss photometric dynamic ranges necessary to get robust results from Sérsic fits.},

  abstract      = {ABRIDGED- The UV-optical color magnitude diagram (CMD) of rich galaxy groups is characterised by a well developed Red Sequence (RS), a Blue Cloud (BC) and the so-called Green Valley (GV). Loose, less evolved groups of galaxies likely not virialized yet may lack a well defined RS. This is actually explained in the framework of galaxy evolution. We are focussing on understanding galaxy migration towards the RS, checking for signatures of such a transition in their photometric and morphological properties. We report on the UV properties of a sample of ETGs galaxies inhabiting the RS. The analysis of their structures, as derived by fitting a Sersic law to their UV luminosity profiles, suggests the presence of an underlying disk. This is the hallmark of dissipation processes that still must have a role in the evolution of this class of galaxies. SPH simulations with chemo-photometric implementations able to match the global properties of our targets are used to derive their evolutionary paths through UV-optical CDM, providing some fundamental information such as the crossing time through the GV, which depends on their luminosity. The transition from the BC to the RS takes several Gyrs, being about 3-5 Gyr for the the brightest galaxies and more long for fainter ones, if it occurs. The photometric study of nearby galaxy structures in UV is seriously hampered by either the limited FoV of the cameras (e.g in HST) or by the low spatial resolution of the images (e.g in the GALEX). Current missions equipped with telescopes and cameras sensitive to UV wavelengths, such as Swift-UVOT and Astrosat-UVIT, provide a relatively large FoV and better resolution than the GALEX. More powerful UV instruments (size, resolution and FoV) are obviously bound to yield fundamental advances in the accuracy and depth of the surface photometry and in the characterisation of the galaxy environment.},

A sample is drawn from bulge-dominated Galaxy Evolution Explorer /Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( GALEX /SDSS) galaxies on the optical red sequence with strong UV excess and yet quiescent SDSS spectra. High-resolution far-UV imaging of 27 such ETGs using Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys/Solar Blind Channel (ACS/SBC) reveals structured UV morphology in 93% of the sample, consistent with low-level ongoing SF (~0.5 M ☉ yr –1 ). In 3/4 of the sample the SF is extended on galaxy scales (25-75 kpc), while the rest contains smaller (5-15 kpc) SF patches in the vicinity of an ETG—presumably gas-rich satellites being disrupted. Optical imaging reveals that all ETGs with galaxy-scale SF in our sample have old stellar disks (mostly S0 type). None is classified as a true elliptical. In our sample, galaxy-scale SF takes the form of UV rings of varying sizes and morphologies. For the majority of such objects we conclude that the gas needed to fuel current SF has been accreted from the intergalactic medium, probably in a prolonged, quasi-static manner, leading in some cases to additional disk buildup. The remaining ETGs with galaxy-scale SF have UV and optical morphologies consistent with minor merger-driven SF or with the final stages of SF in fading spirals. Our analysis excludes that all recent SF on the red sequence resulted from gas-rich mergers. We find further evidence that galaxy-scale SF is almost exclusively an S0 phenomenon (~20% S0s have SF) by examining the overall optically red SDSS ETGs. Conclusion is that significant number of field S0s maintain or resume low-level SF because the preventive feedback is not in place or is intermittent. True ellipticals, on the other hand, stay entirely quiescent even in the field.},

  abstract = {We present evidence for very high gas fractions and extended molecular gas reservoirs in normal, near-infrared-selected (BzK) galaxies at z ~ 1.5. Our results are based on multi-configuration CO[2-1] observations obtained at the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer. All six star-forming galaxies observed were detected at high significance. High spatial resolution observations resolve the CO emission in four of them, implying sizes of the gas reservoirs of order of 6-11 kpc and suggesting the presence of ordered rotation. The galaxies have UV morphologies consistent with clumpy, unstable disks, and UV sizes that are consistent with those measured in CO. The star formation efficiencies are homogeneously low within the sample and similar to those of local spirals—the resulting gas depletion times are ~0.5 Gyr, much higher than what is seen in high- z submillimeter galaxies and quasars. The CO luminosities can be predicted to within 0.15 dex from the observed star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses, implying a tight correlation of the gas mass with these quantities. We use new dynamical models of clumpy disk galaxies to derive dynamical masses for our sample. These models are able to reproduce the peculiar spectral line shapes of the CO emission. After accounting for the stellar and dark matter masses, we derive molecular gas reservoirs with masses of (0.4-1.2)×10 11 M ☉ . The implied conversion (CO luminosity-to-gas mass) factor is very high: α CO = 3.6 ± 0.8, consistent with a Galactic conversion factor but 4 times higher than that of local ultra-luminous IR galaxies that is typically used for high-redshift objects. The gas mass in these galaxies is comparable to or larger than the stellar mass, and the gas accounts for an impressive 50%-65% of the baryons within the galaxies' half-light radii. We are thus witnessing truly gas-dominated galaxies at z ~ 1.5, a finding that explains the high specific SFRs observed for z > 1 galaxies. The BzK galaxies can be viewed as scaled-up versions of local disk galaxies, with low-efficiency star formation taking place inside extended, low-excitation gas disks. These galaxies are markedly different than local ULIRGs and high- z submillimeter galaxies and quasars, where higher excitation and more compact gas is found.},

  abstract = {Surface photometry shows that most spiral and S0 galaxies have two main components: a spheroidal component, and an exponential disk component with radial surface-brightness distribution 1(R) = Ioe 5. The exponential disk is the subject of this paper. First, for the exponential disk in centrifugal equilibrium with surface density (R) = , we derive the circular-velocity field and the mass- angular momentum distribution (h); (h) is the total mass with angular momentum per unit mass less than h. (h) for the exponential disk is almost identical with (k) for a family of rigidly rotating spheres of uniform density. We then collect photometric data for the disks of thirty-six spiral and S0 galaxies, and find the following: (i) Twenty-eight of the thirty-six galaxies have approximately the same intensity scale 1o (21.65 B-mag per square second of arc), with a standard deviation of only 0.30 mag per square second of arc, despite a range of nearly 5 mag in absolute magnitude. This constancy of 1o produces the correlation between apparent magnitude and angular diameter found by Hubble. (ii) S0-Sbc systems have any value of the disk length scale between 1 and 5 kpc, while later-type systems have predominantly low values of a ($\lt$2 kpc). (iii) The relative brightness and size of the spheroidal and disk components are only weakly with morphological type. If conclusion (i) implies that s is approximately constant, then the disk's total mass and angular momentum satisfy 7/4 If (h) is invariant as a protogalaxy collapses to form a galaxy, then all protogalaxies destined to be S0 or spiral galaxies have a similar (h) (in dimensionless variables), at least for the range of h corresponding to the disk. If (k) is not invariant, then there exists a very efficient mechanism which establishes the characteristic ) (h) for these systems as they form.

By splitting our sample by redshift, we can use the fixed size of the SDSS fiber to model the stellar populations at different radii within galaxies. At 0.02$\lt$z$\lt$0.04, the SDSS fiber radius corresponds to \~{}1 kpc, which is the typical half-light radii of both classical bulges and disky pseudobulges. Assuming that the SDSS fiber primarily covers the bulges at these redshifts, our analysis shows that there are no significant differences in the stellar populations, i.e., stellar age, [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], and [N/Fe], of the bulges of barred vs. unbarred quiescent disk galaxies. Modeling the stellar populations at different redshift intervals from z=0.020 to z=0.085 at fixed stellar masses produces an estimate of the stellar population gradients out to about half the typical effective radius of our sample, assuming null evolution over this \~{}1 Gyr epoch. We find that there are no noticeable differences in the slopes of the azimuthally averaged gradients of barred vs. unbarred quiescent disk galaxies.

  abstract      = {We aim at discerning the distribution of stellar population parameters (extinction, age, metallicity, and sSFR) of quiescent galaxies within the rest-frame stellar mass- and $UVJ$ colour-colour diagrams up to $z\sim1$ and down to $I=23$ AB, as well as the development of new diagrams to reduce the contamination from dust-reddened galaxies in samples of quiescent galaxies. By use of the photometric data from ALHAMBRA, we determine stellar population parameters of quiescent galaxies using the SED-fitting code MUFFIT and different SSP models. Through the extinctions retrieved by MUFFIT, we remove dusty star forming galaxies from the sample. The distribution of all the stellar populations parameters is also fitted by a bidimensional and locally weighted regression method (LOESS) across the rest-frame diagrams to reduce the impact of uncertainties and provide the distribution of stellar population parameters. Quiescent galaxies selected via $UVJ$ diagrams are typically contaminated by a \~{}20\% fraction of dusty star forming galaxies. A significant part of the galaxies that reside in the green valley are actually obscured star-forming galaxies (\~{}65\%). Therefore, the transition of galaxies from the blue cloud to the red sequence, and hence the related mechanisms for quenching, seems to be much more efficient and faster than previously considered. There are well defined correlations in both the rest-frame stellar mass- and $UVJ$ colour-colour diagrams that allow to constrain the ages, metallicities, extinctions, and sSFR of quiescent galaxies with only their rest-frame colours, redshifts and stellar masses. Dust corrections play an important role in understanding how quiescent galaxies are distributed in these diagrams. To perform a pure non-biased selection of quiescent galaxies from these diagrams is key to include dust corrections of the involved colours and also the galaxy stellar mass.},

Low S{\'e}rsic index and axis ratio, with median values n \~{}1.5 and b/a \~{} 0.65, respectively, indicate that most of the pVJL galaxies are disk-dominated. Despite large uncertainty, the inner region of the median mass profile of our pVJL galaxies is similar to those of QGs at 0.5 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2.5 and local ETGs. It indicates that local massive ETGs have been formed according to an inside-out scenario: the compact galaxies at high redshift make up the cores of local massive ETGs and then build up the outskirts according to dissipationless minor mergers.},

These massive spheroidal galaxies have, in the present day, very little gas or dust in proportion to their mass$^{1}$, and their stellar populations have been evolving passively for over 10 billion years. The physical mechanisms that led to the termination of star formation in these galaxies and depletion of their interstellar medium remain largely conjectural. In particular, there are currently no direct measurements of the amount of residual gas that might still be present in newly quiescent spheroidals at high redshift$^{2}$. Here we show that quiescent ETGs at redshift z   1.8, close to their epoch of quenching, contained at least two orders of magnitude more dust at a fixed stellar mass compared with local ETGs. This implies the presence of substantial amounts of gas (5-10\%), which has been consumed less efficiently than in more active galaxies, probably due to their spheroidal morphology, consistent with our simulations. This lower star formation efficiency, combined with an extended hot gas halo possibly maintained by persistent feedback from an active galactic nucleus, keep ETGs mostly passive throughout cosmic time.},

  abstract      = {Although there has been much progress in understanding how galaxies evolve, we still do not understand how and when they stop forming stars and become quiescent. We address this by applying our galaxy spectral energy distribution models, which incorporate physically motivated star formation histories (SFHs) from cosmological simulations, to a sample of quiescent galaxies at $0.2\ltz\lt2.1$. A total of 845 quiescent galaxies with multi-band photometry spanning rest-frame ultraviolet through near-infrared wavelengths are selected from the CANDELS dataset. We compute median SFHs of these galaxies in bins of stellar mass and redshift. At all redshifts and stellar masses, the median SFHs rise, reach a peak, and then decline to reach quiescence. At high redshift, we find that the rise and decline are fast, as expected because the Universe is young. At low redshift, the duration of these phases depends strongly on stellar mass. Low-mass galaxies ($\log(M\_{\ast}/M\_{\odot})\sim9.5$) grow on average slowly, take a long time to reach their peak of star formation ($\gtrsim 4$ Gyr), and the declining phase is fast ($\lesssim 2$ Gyr). Conversely, high-mass galaxies ($\log(M\_{\ast}/M\_{\odot})\sim11$) grow on average fast ($\lesssim 2$ Gyr), and, after reaching their peak, decrease the star formation slowly ($\gtrsim 3$ Gyr). These findings are consistent with galaxy stellar mass being a driving factor in determining how evolved galaxies are, with high-mass galaxies being the most evolved at any time (i.e., downsizing). The different durations we observe in the declining phases also suggest that low- and high-mass galaxies experience different quenching mechanisms that operate on different timescales.},

  abstract = {Using stellar kinematics measurements, we investigate the growth of massive, quiescent galaxies from z ~ 2 to today. We present X-Shooter spectra from the UV to NIR and dynamical mass measurements of five quiescent massive (>10 11 M ☉ ) galaxies at z ~ 2. This triples the sample of z > 1.5 galaxies with well-constrained (δσ < 100 km s –1 ) velocity dispersion measurements. From spectral population synthesis modeling we find that these galaxies have stellar ages that range from 0.5 to 2 Gyr, with no signs of ongoing star formation. We measure velocity dispersions (290-450 km s –1 ) from stellar absorption lines and find that they are 1.6-2.1 times higher than those of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at the same mass. Sizes are measured using GALFIT from Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 H 160 and UDS K -band images. The dynamical masses correspond well to the spectral energy distribution based stellar masses, with dynamical masses that are ~15% higher. We find that M * / M dyn may decrease slightly with time, which could reflect the increase of the dark matter fraction within an increasing effective radius. We combine different stellar kinematic studies from the literature and examine the structural evolution from z ~ 2 to z ~ 0: we confirm that at fixed dynamical mass, the effective radius increases by a factor of ~2.8, and the velocity dispersion decreases by a factor of ~1.7. The mass density within one effective radius decreases by a factor of ~20, while within a fixed physical radius (1 kpc) it decreases only mildly (factor of ~2). When we allow for an evolving mass limit by selecting a population of galaxies at fixed number density, a stronger size growth with time is found (factor of ~4), velocity dispersion decreases by a factor of ~1.4, and interestingly, the mass density within 1 kpc is consistent with no evolution. This finding suggests that massive quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2 grow inside out, consistent with the expectations from minor mergers.},

  abstract      = {We investigate the origin of the evolution of the population-averaged central stellar mass density ($\Sigma\_1$) of quiescent galaxies (QGs) by probing the relation between stellar age and $\Sigma\_1$ at $z\sim0$. We use the Zurich ENvironmental Study (ZENS), which is a survey of galaxy groups with a large fraction of satellite galaxies. QGs shape a narrow locus in the $\Sigma\_1-M\_{\star}$ plane, which we refer to as $\Sigma\_1$ ridgeline. Colors of ($B-I$) and ($I-J$) are used to divide QGs into three age categories: young ($\lt2~\mathrm{Gyr}$), intermediate ($2-4~\mathrm{Gyr}$), and old ($\gt4~\mathrm{Gyr}$). At fixed stellar mass, old QGs on the $\Sigma\_1$ ridgeline have higher $\Sigma\_1$ than young QGs. This shows that galaxies landing on the $\Sigma\_1$ ridgeline at later epochs arrive with lower $\Sigma\_1$, which drives the zeropoint of the ridgeline down with time. We compare the present-day zeropoint of the oldest population at $z=0$ with the zeropoint of the quiescent population 4 Gyr back in time, at $z=0.37$. These zeropoints are identical, showing that the intrinsic evolution of individual galaxies after they arrive on the $\Sigma\_1$ ridgeline must be negligible, or must evolve parallel to the ridgeline during this interval. The observed evolution of the global zeropoint of 0.07 dex over the last 4 Gyr is thus largely due to the continuous addition of newly quenched galaxies with lower $\Sigma\_1$ at later times (``progenitor bias''). While these results refer to the satellite-rich ZENS sample as a whole, our work suggests a similar age-$\Sigma\_1$ trend for central galaxies.},

  abstract      = {The presence of massive, compact, quiescent galaxies at z$\gt$2 presents a major challenge for theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution. Using one of the deepest large public near-IR surveys to date, we investigate in detail the correlations between star formation and galaxy structural parameters (size, stellar mass, and surface density) from z = 2 to the present. At all redshifts, massive quiescent galaxies (i.e., those with little or no star formation) occupy the extreme high end of the surface density distribution and follow a tight mass-size correlation, while star-forming galaxies show a broad range of both densities and sizes. Conversely, galaxies with the highest surface densities comprise a nearly homogeneous population with little or no ongoing star formation, while less dense galaxies exhibit high star formation rates and varying levels of dust obscuration. Both the sizes and surface densities of quiescent galaxies evolve strongly from z = 2-0; we parameterize this evolution for both populations with simple power-law functions and present best-fit parameters for comparison to future theoretical models. Higher-mass quiescent galaxies undergo faster structural evolution, consistent with previous results. Interestingly, star-forming galaxies' sizes and densities evolve at rates similar to those of quiescent galaxies. It is therefore possible that the same physical processes drive the structural evolution of both populations, suggesting that ``dry mergers'' may not be the sole culprit in this size evolution.},

  abstract      = {We present an empirical method of assessing the star formation rate (SFR) of star-forming galaxies based on their locations in the rest-frame color-color diagram (NUV - r) vs. (r - K). By using the Spitzer 24 {$\mu$}m sample in the COSMOS field (\~{}16 400 galaxies with 0.2 {\le} z {\le} 1.3) and a local GALEX-SDSS-SWIRE sample (\~{}700 galaxies with z {\le} 0.2), we show that the mean infrared excess {\mlab}IRX{\mrab} = {\mlab} L$_{IR}$/L$_{UV}$ {\mrab} can be described by a single vector, NRK , that combines the two colors. The calibration between {\mlab}IRX{\mrab} and NRK allows us to recover the IR luminosity, L$_{IR}$, with an accuracy of {$\sigma$} \~{} 0.21 for the COSMOS sample and 0.27 dex for the local one. The SFRs derived with this method agree with the ones based on the observed (UV+IR) luminosities and on the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting for the vast majority (\~{}85\%) of the star-forming population. Thanks to a library of model galaxy SEDs with realistic prescriptions for the star formation history, we show that we need to include a two-component dust model (i.e., birth clouds and diffuse ISM) and a full distribution of galaxy inclinations in order to reproduce the behavior of the {\mlab}IRX{\mrab} stripes in the NUVrK diagram. In conclusion, the NRK method, based only on the rest-frame UV/optical colors available in most of the extragalactic fields, offers a simple alternative of assessing the SFR of star-forming galaxies in the absence of far-IR or spectral diagnostic observations.

We present a composite rest-frame 4300–7300 Å spectrum for DSFGs, and find evidence of 200 ± 30 km s −1 gas outflows. Nebular line emission for a subsample of our detections indicate that hard ionizing radiation fields are ubiquitous in high- z DSFGs, even more so than typical mass or UV-selected high- z galaxies. We also confirm the extreme level of dust obscuration in DSFGs, measuring very high Balmer decrements and very high ratios of IR to UV and IR to H α luminosities. This work demonstrates the need to broaden the use of wide bandwidth technology in the millimeter to spectroscopically confirm larger samples of high- z DSFGs, as the difficulty in confirming such sources at optical/near-infrared wavelengths is exceedingly challenging given their obscuration.},

We also find that the star formation rate (SFR) and specific SFR (sSFR) of sgzKs increases with redshift at all masses, implying that star-forming galaxies were much more active on average in the past. Moreover, the sSFR of massive galaxies is lower at all redshifts, suggesting that star formation contributes more to the mass growth of low-mass galaxies than to high-mass galaxies. From the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 near-infrared imaging data we find that morphologies of z \~{} 2 galaxies not only have diffuse structures with lower G and higher M $_{20}$ values, but also have single-object morphologies (higher G and lower M $_{20}$), implying that there are morphological variety and different formation process for these galaxies at z \~{} 2.

The survey consists of 42 orbits of F160W imaging covering ~65 arcmin 2 distributed widely across the sky and reaching a depth of 27.9 AB for a 5σ detection within a 0.2 arcsec radius aperture. Focusing on an optically selected sample of 306 star-forming galaxies with stellar masses in the range M * = 10 9 -10 11 M ☉ , we find that typical circularized effective half-light radii range from ~0.7 to 3.0 kpc and describe a stellar mass-radius relation as early as z ~ 3. While these galaxies are best described by an exponential surface brightness profile (Sérsic index n ~ 1), their distribution of axis ratios is strongly inconsistent with a population of inclined exponential disks and is better reproduced by triaxial stellar systems with minor/major and intermediate/major axis ratios ~0.3 and 0.7, respectively. While rest-UV and rest-optical morphologies are generally similar for a subset of galaxies with HST /Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging data, differences are more pronounced at higher masses M * > 3 × 10 10 M ☉ . Finally, we discuss galaxy morphology in the context of efforts to constrain the merger fraction, finding that morphologically identified mergers/non-mergers generally have insignificant differences in terms of physical observables such as stellar mass and star formation rate, although merger-like galaxies selected according to some criteria have statistically smaller effective radii and correspondingly larger Σ SFR .},

  abstract      = {The rest-frame UV-optical (i.e., $NUV-B$) color is sensitive to both low-level recent star formation (specific star formation rate - sSFR) and dust. In this Letter, we extend our previous work on the origins of $NUV-B$ color gradients in star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at $z\sim1$ to those at $z\sim2$. We use a sample of 1335 large (semi-major axis radius $R\_{\rm SMA}\gt0.''18$) SFGs with extended UV emission out to $2R\_{\rm SMA}$ in the mass range $M\_{\ast} = 10^{9}-10^{11}M\_{\odot}$ at $1.5\ltz\lt2.8$ in the CANDELS/GOODS-S and UDS fields. We show that these SFGs generally have negative $NUV-B$ color gradients (redder centres), and their color gradients strongly increase with galaxy mass. We also show that the global rest-frame $FUV-NUV$ color is approximately linear with $A\_{\rm V}$, which is derived by modeling the observed integrated FUV to NIR spectral energy distributions of the galaxies. Applying this integrated calibration to our spatially-resolved data, we find a negative dust gradient (more dust extinguished in the centers), which steadily becomes steeper with galaxy mass. We further find that the $NUV-B$ color gradients become nearly zero after correcting for dust gradients regardless of galaxy mass. This indicates that the sSFR gradients are negligible and dust reddening is likely the principal cause of negative UV-optical color gradients in these SFGs. Our findings support that the buildup of the stellar mass in SFGs at the Cosmic Noon is self-similar inside $2R\_{\rm SMA}$.},

  abstract      = {The rest-frame UV-optical (i.e., NUV-B) color index is sensitive to the low-level recent star formation and dust extinction, but it is insensitive to the metallicity. In this Letter, we have measured the rest-frame NUV-B color gradients in \~{}1400 large ($\rm r\_e\gt0.18^{\prime\prime}$), nearly face-on (b/a$\gt$0.5) main-sequence star-forming galaxies (SFGs) between redshift 0.5 and 1.5 in the CANDELS/GOODS-S and UDS fields. With this sample, we study the origin of UV-optical color gradients in the SFGs at z\~{}1 and discuss their link with the buildup of stellar mass. We find that the more massive, centrally compact, and more dust extinguished SFGs tend to have statistically more negative raw color gradients (redder centers) than the less massive, centrally diffuse, and less dusty SFGs. After correcting for dust reddening based on optical-SED fitting, the color gradients in the low-mass ($M\_{\ast} \lt10^{10}M\_{\odot}$) SFGs generally become quite flat, while most of the high-mass ($M\_{\ast} \gt 10^{10.5}M\_{\odot}$) SFGs still retain shallow negative color gradients. These findings imply that dust reddening is likely the principal cause of negative color gradients in the low-mass SFGs, while both increased central dust reddening and buildup of compact old bulges are likely the origins of negative color gradients in the high-mass SFGs. These findings also imply that at these redshifts the low-mass SFGs buildup their stellar masses in a self-similar way, while the high-mass SFGs grow inside out.},

  abstract = {In order to try to understand the internal evolution of galaxies and relate this to the global evolution of the galaxy population, we present a comparative study of the dependence of star formation rates on the average surface mass densities (Σ M ) of galaxies at 0.5 < z < 0.9 and 0.04 < z < 0.08, using the zCOSMOS and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) surveys, respectively. We derive star formation rates, stellar masses, and structural parameters in a consistent way for both samples, and apply them to samples that are complete down to the same stellar mass at both redshifts. We first show that the characteristic step-function dependence of median specific star formation rate (SSFR) on Σ M in SDSS, seen by Brinchmann et al., is due to the change over from predominantly disk galaxies to predominantly spheroidal galaxies at the surface mass density logΣ M char ~8.5 at which the SSFR is seen to drop. Turning to zCOSMOS, we find a similar shape for the median SSFR-Σ M relation, but with median SSFR values that are about 5-6 times higher than for SDSS, across the whole range of Σ M , and in galaxies with both high and low Sersic indices. This emphasizes that galaxies of all types are contributing, proportionally, to the global increase in star formation rate density in the Universe back to these redshifts. The Σ M char "step" shifts to slightly higher values of Σ M in zCOSMOS relative to SDSS, but this can be explained by a modest differential evolution in the size-mass relations of disk and spheroid galaxies. For low Sersic index galaxies, there is little change in the size-mass relation, as seen by Barden et al., although we suggest that this does not necessarily imply inside-out growth of disks, at least not in this redshift range. On the other hand, there is a modest evolution in the stellar mass-size relation for high Sersic index galaxies, with galaxies smaller by ~25% at z ~ 0.7. Taken together these produce a modest increase in Σ M char . Low Sersic index galaxies have a SSFR that is almost independent of Σ M , and the same is probably also true of high Sersic index galaxies once obvious disk systems are excluded.},

The data indicate that the high specific SF rates (SFRs) of many less massive galaxies do not represent late, irregular or recurrent, starbursts in evolved galaxies. They rather seem to reflect the onset (initial burst) of the dominant SF episode of galaxies, after which SF gradually declines on gigayear timescales to z=0 and forms the bulk of a galaxy's M$_{*}$. With decreasing mass, this onset of major SF shifts to decreasing z for an increasing fraction of galaxies (staged galaxy formation). This process may be an important component of the ``downsizing'' phenomenon. We find that the predominantly gradual decline of SFRs described by Noeske et al. can be reproduced by exponential SF histories ({$\tau$} models), if less massive galaxies have systematically longer e-folding times {$\tau$}, and a later onset of SF (z$_{f}$). Our model can provide a first parameterization of SFR as a function of M$_{*}$ and z, and quantify mass dependences of {$\tau$} and z$_{f}$, from direct observations of M$_{*}$ and SFRs up to z$\gt$1. The observed evolution of SF in galaxies can plausibly reflect the dominance of gradual gas exhaustion. The data are also consistent with the history of cosmological accretion onto dark matter halos.},

Among the 28 sBzKs observed, H{$\alpha$} emission was detected in 14 objects, and for 11 of them the [N II] {$\lambda$}6583 flux was also measured. Multiwavelength photometry was also used to derive stellar masses and extinction parameters, whereas H{$\alpha$} and [N II] emissions have allowed us to estimate star formation rates (SFRs), metallicities, ionization mechanisms, and dynamical masses. In order to enforce agreement between SFRs from H{$\alpha$} with those derived from rest-frame UV and mid-infrared, additional obscuration for the emission lines (that originate in H II regions) was required compared to the extinction derived from the slope of the UV continuum. We have also derived the stellar mass-metallicity relation, as well as the relation between stellar mass and specific SFR (SSFR), and compared them to the results in other studies. At a given stellar mass, the sBzKs appear to have been already enriched to metallicities close to those of local star-forming galaxies of similar mass. The sBzKs presented here tend to have higher metallicities compared to those of UV-selected galaxies, indicating that near-infrared selected galaxies tend to be a chemically more evolved population. The sBzKs show SSFRs that are systematically higher, by up to \~{}2 orders of magnitude, compared to those of local galaxies of the same mass. The empirical correlations between stellar mass and metallicity, and stellar mass and SSFR are then compared with those of evolutionary population synthesis models constructed either with the simple closed-box assumption, or within an infall scenario. Within the assumptions that are built-in such models, it appears that a short timescale for the star formation (sime100 Myr) and large initial gas mass appear to be required if one wants to reproduce both relations simultaneously.  Based on data collected at the Subaru telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (S04A-081, S05A-098), and on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Paranal, Chile (075.A-0439).},

  abstract = {We study the star formation rates (SFRs) of galaxies as a function of local galaxy density at 0.6 < z < 0.9. We used a low-dispersion prism in IMACS on the 6.5 m Baade (Magellan I) telescope to obtain spectra and measured redshifts to a precision of σ z /(1 + z ) ~ 1% for galaxies with z AB < 23.3 mag. We utilized a stellar mass-limited sample of 977 galaxies above M > 1.8 × 10 10 M ☉ (log M / M ☉ >10.25) to conduct our main analysis. With three different SFR indicators, (1) Spitzer MIPS 24 μm imaging, (2) spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, and (3) [O II ]λ3727 emission, we find the median specific SFR (SSFR) and SFR to decline from the low-density field to the cores of groups and a rich cluster. For the SED- and [O II ]-based SFRs, the decline in SSFR is roughly an order of magnitude while for the MIPS-based SFRs, the decline is a factor of ~4. We find approximately the same magnitude of decline in SSFR even after removing the sample of galaxies near the cluster. Galaxies in groups and a cluster at these redshifts therefore have lower star formation (SF) activity than galaxies in the field, as is the case at z ~ 0. We investigated whether the decline in SFR with increasing density is caused by a change in the proportion of quiescent and star-forming galaxies (SFGs) or by a decline in the SFRs of SFGs. Using the rest-frame U – V and V – J colors to distinguish quiescent galaxies from SFGs (including both unattenuated blue galaxies and reddened ones), we find that the fraction of quiescent galaxies increases from ~32% to 79% from low to high density. In addition, we find the SSFRs of SFGs, selected based on U – V and V – J colors, to decline with increasing density by factors of ~5-6 for the SED- and [O II ]-based SFRs. The MIPS-based SSFRs for SFGs decline with a shallower slope. The declining SFRs of SFGs with density are paralleled by a decline in the median A V , providing indirect evidence that the cold gas content that fuels future SF is diminished in higher density environments. The order of magnitude decline in the SSFR-density relation at 0.6 < z < 0.9 is therefore driven by both a combination of declining SFRs of SFGs as well as a changing mix of SFGs and quiescent galaxies.},

These galaxies are selected from sensitive blank-field surveys of the 2′ × 2′ Hubble Ultra-Deep Field at λ = 5 cm and 1.3 mm using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. They have star formation rates (SFRs), stellar masses, and dust properties representative of massive main-sequence SFGs at z ∼ 2. Morphological classification performed on spatially resolved stellar mass maps indicates a mixture of disk and morphologically disturbed systems; half of the sample harbor X-ray active galactic nuclei (AGNs), thereby representing a diversity of z ∼ 2 SFGs undergoing vigorous mass assembly. We find that their intense star formation most frequently occurs at the location of stellar-mass concentration and extends over an area comparable to their stellar-mass distribution, with a median diameter of 4.2 ± 1.8 kpc. This provides direct evidence of galaxy-wide star formation in distant blank-field-selected main-sequence SFGs. The typical galactic-average SFR surface density is 2.5 M ⊙ yr −1 kpc −2 , sufficiently high to drive outflows. In X-ray-selected AGN where radio emission is enhanced over the level associated with star formation, the radio excess pinpoints the AGNs, which are found to be cospatial with star formation. The median extinction-independent size of main-sequence SFGs is two times larger than those of bright submillimeter galaxies, whose SFRs are 3–8 times larger, providing a constraint on the characteristic SFR (∼300 M ⊙ yr −1 ) above which a significant population of more compact SFGs appears to emerge.},

  abstract      = {We present spectroscopic observations in the rest-frame optical and near- to mid-infrared wavelengths of four gravitationally lensed infrared (IR) luminous star-forming galaxies at redshift 1 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3 from the LUCIFER instrument on the Large Binocular Telescope and the Infrared Spectrograph on Spitzer. The sample was selected to represent pure, actively star-forming systems, absent of active galactic nuclei. The large lensing magnifications result in high signal-to-noise spectra that can probe faint IR recombination lines, including Pa-alpha and Br-alpha at high redshifts. The sample was augmented by three lensed galaxies with similar suites of unpublished data and observations from the literature, resulting in the final sample of seven galaxies. We use the IR recombination lines in conjunction with H-alpha observations to probe the extinction, Av, of these systems, as well as testing star formation rate (SFR) indicators against the SFR measured by fitting spectral energy distributions to far-IR photometry. Our galaxies occupy a range of Av from \~{}0 to 5.9 mag, larger than previously known for a similar range of IR luminosities at these redshifts. Thus, estimates of SFR even at z \~{} 2 must take careful count of extinction in the most IR luminous galaxies. We also measure extinction by comparing SFR estimates from optical emission lines with those from far-IR measurements. The comparison of results from these two independent methods indicates a large variety of dust distribution scenarios at 1 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3. Without correcting for dust extinction, the H-alpha SFR indicator underestimates the SFR; the size of the necessary correction depends on the IR luminosity and dust distribution scenario. Individual SFR estimates based on the 6.2 micron PAH emission line luminosity do not show a systematic discrepancy with extinction, although a considerable, \~{}0.2 dex scatter is observed.},

  abstract      = {We derive two-dimensional dust attenuation maps at $\sim1~\mathrm{kpc}$ resolution from the UV continuum for 10 galaxies on the $z\sim2$ Star-Forming Main Sequence (SFMS). Comparison with IR data shows that 9 out of 10 galaxies have no further obscuration in addition to the UV-based correction. The individual rest-frame $V$-band dust attenuation (A$\_{\rm V}$) radial profiles scatter around an average profile that gently decreases from $\sim1.8$ mag in the center down to $\sim0.6$ mag at $\sim3-4$ half-mass radii. We use these A$\_{\rm V}$ maps to correct UV- and H$\alpha$-based star-formation rates (SFRs), which agree with each other. At masses $\leq10^{11}~M\_{\odot}$, the specific SFR (sSFR) profiles are on average radially constant at a mass-doubling timescale of $\sim300~\mathrm{Myr}$, pointing at a synchronous growth of bulge and disk components in such galaxies. At masses $\geq10^{11}~M\_{\odot}$, the dust-corrected sSFR profiles are typically centrally-suppressed by a factor of $\sim10$ relative to the galaxy outskirts. With total central obscuration disfavored, this indicates that at least a fraction of massive $z\sim2$ SFMS galaxies have started inside-out their star-formation quenching that will move them to the quenched sequence; this also highlights the key role of progenitor bias effects in the observed evolution of the quenched population. Galaxies above and below the ridge of the SFMS relation have respectively centrally-enhanced and centrally-suppressed sSFRs relative to their outskirts, supporting a picture where bulges are built due to gas `compaction' that leads to a high central SFR as galaxies move towards the upper envelope of SFMS.},

  abstract      = {Using cosmological simulations, we address the properties of high-redshift star-forming galaxies (SFGs) across their main sequence (MS) in the plane of star formation rate (SFR) versus stellar mass. We relate them to the evolution of galaxies through phases of gas compaction, depletion, possible replenishment, and eventual quenching. We find that the high-SFR galaxies in the upper envelope of the MS are compact, with high gas fractions and short depletion times (`blue nuggets'), while the lower SFR galaxies in the lower envelope have lower central gas densities, lower gas fractions, and longer depletion times, consistent with observed gradients across the MS. Stellar-structure gradients are negligible. The SFGs oscillate about the MS ridge on time-scales {\tilde}0.4t$_{Hubble}$ ({\tilde}1 Gyr at z {\tilde} 3). The propagation upwards is due to gas compaction, triggered, e.g. by mergers, counter-rotating streams, and/or violent disc instabilities. The downturn at the upper envelope is due to central gas depletion by peak star formation and outflows while inflow from the shrunken gas disc is suppressed. An upturn at the lower envelope can occur once the extended disc has been replenished by fresh gas and a new compaction can be triggered, namely as long as the replenishment time is shorter than the depletion time. The mechanisms of gas compaction, depletion, and replenishment confine the SFGs to the narrow ({\plusmn}0.3 dex) MS. Full quenching occurs in massive haloes (M$_{vir}$ $\gt$ 10$^{11.5}$ M$_{⊙}$) and/or at low redshifts (z $\lt$ 3), where the replenishment time is long compared to the depletion time, explaining the observed bending down of the MS at the massive end.},

  abstract      = {Stars form from cold molecular interstellar gas. As this is relatively rare in the local Universe, galaxies like the Milky Way form only a few new stars per year. Typical massive galaxies in the distant Universe formed stars an order of magnitude more rapidly. Unless star formation was significantly more efficient, this difference suggests that young galaxies were much more molecular-gas rich. Molecular gas observations in the distant Universe have so far largely been restricted to very luminous, rare objects, including mergers and quasars, and accordingly we do not yet have a clear idea about the gas content of more normal (albeit massive) galaxies. Here we report the results of a survey of molecular gas in samples of typical massive-star-forming galaxies at mean redshifts $\lt$z$\gt$ of about 1.2 and 2.3, when the Universe was respectively 40\% and 24\% of its current age. Our measurements reveal that distant star forming galaxies were indeed gas rich, and that the star formation efficiency is not strongly dependent on cosmic epoch. The average fraction of cold gas relative to total galaxy baryonic mass at z = 2.3 and z = 1.2 is respectively about 44\% and 34\%, three to ten times higher than in today's massive spiral galaxies. The slow decrease between z\~{}2 and z\~{}1 probably requires a mechanism of semi-continuous replenishment of fresh gas to the young galaxies.},

PHIBSS provides 52 CO detections in two redshift slices at z ~ 1.2 and 2.2, with log( M * ( M ☉ )) ≥ 10.4 and log(SFR( M ☉ /yr)) ≥ 1.5. Including a correction for the incomplete coverage of the M * -SFR plane, and adopting a "Galactic" value for the CO-H 2 conversion factor, we infer average gas fractions of ~0.33 at z ~ 1.2 and ~0.47 at z ~ 2.2. Gas fractions drop with stellar mass, in agreement with cosmological simulations including strong star formation feedback. Most of the z ~ 1-3 SFGs are rotationally supported turbulent disks. The sizes of CO and UV/optical emission are comparable. The molecular-gas-star-formation relation for the z = 1-3 SFGs is near-linear, with a ~0.7 Gyr gas depletion timescale; changes in depletion time are only a secondary effect. Since this timescale is much less than the Hubble time in all SFGs between z ~ 0 and 2, fresh gas must be supplied with a fairly high duty cycle over several billion years. At given z and M * , gas fractions correlate strongly with the specific star formation rate (sSFR). The variation of sSFR between z ~ 0 and 3 is mainly controlled by the fraction of baryonic mass that resides in cold gas.},

In this paper, we have for the first time selected a sample of 77 massive SF galaxies with an {\ldquo}outside-in{\rdquo} assembly mode (called the {\ldquo}targeted sample{\rdquo}) from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at the Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey. For comparison, two control samples are constructed from the MaNGA sample matched in stellar mass: a sample of 154 normal SF galaxies and a sample of 62 quiescent galaxies. In contrast to normal SF galaxies, the targeted galaxies appear to be smoother and more bulge-dominated and have a smaller size and higher concentration, star formation rate, and gas-phase metallicity as a whole. However, they have a larger size and lower concentration than quiescent galaxies. Unlike the normal SF sample, the targeted sample exhibits a slightly positive gradient of the 4000 {\AA} break and a pronounced negative gradient of H{$\alpha$} equivalent width. Furthermore, the median surface mass density profile is between those of the normal SF and quiescent samples, indicating that the gas accretion of quiescent galaxies is not likely to be the main approach for the outside-in assembly mode. Our results suggest that the targeted galaxies are likely in the transitional phase from normal SF galaxies to quiescent galaxies, with rapid ongoing central stellar mass assembly (or bulge growth). We discuss several possible formation mechanisms for the outside-in mass assembly mode.},

  abstract      = {We determine the intrinsic, three-dimensional shape distribution of star-forming galaxies at 0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2.5, as inferred from their observed projected axis ratios. In the present-day universe, star-forming galaxies of all masses 10$^{9}$-10$^{11}$ M $_{⊙}$ are predominantly thin, nearly oblate disks, in line with previous studies. We now extend this to higher redshifts, and find that among massive galaxies (M $_{*}$ $\gt$ 10$^{10}$ M $_{⊙}$) disks are the most common geometric shape at all z $\lt$\~{} 2. Lower-mass galaxies at z $\gt$ 1 possess a broad range of geometric shapes: the fraction of elongated (prolate) galaxies increases toward higher redshifts and lower masses. Galaxies with stellar mass 10$^{9}$ M $_{⊙}$ (10$^{10}$ M $_{⊙}$) are a mix of roughly equal numbers of elongated and disk galaxies at z \~{} 1 (z \~{} 2). This suggests that galaxies in this mass range do not yet have disks that are sustained over many orbital periods, implying that galaxies with present-day stellar mass comparable to that of the Milky Way typically first formed such sustained stellar disks at redshift z \~{} 1.5-2. Combined with constraints on the evolution of the star formation rate density and the distribution of star formation over galaxies with different masses, our findings imply that, averaged over cosmic time, the majority of stars formed in disks.

Understanding the origin of such star formation remains an open issue. We present resolved UV-optical photometry of a sample of 19 Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) early-type galaxies at z ~ 0.1 drawn from the sample originally selected by Salim & Rich to lie in the bluer part of the green valley in the UV-optical color-magnitude diagram as measured by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer ( GALEX ). Utilizing high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) far-UV imaging provides unique insight into the distribution of UV light in these galaxies, which we call "extended star-forming early-type galaxies" (ESF-ETGs) because of extended UV emission that is indicative of recent star formation. The UV-optical color profiles of all ESF-ETGs show red centers and blue outer parts. Their outer colors require the existence of a significant underlying population of older stars in the UV-bright regions. An analysis of stacked SDSS spectra reveals weak LINER-like emission in their centers. Using a cross-matched SDSS DR7/ GALEX GR6 catalog, we search for other green valley galaxies with similar properties to these ESF-ETGs and estimate that ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 13% of dust-corrected green valley galaxies of similar stellar mass and UV-optical color are likely ESF-candidates, i.e., ESF-ETGs are not rare.

ESF-ETGs may typify an important subpopulation of galaxies that can linger in the green valley for up to several Gyrs, based on their resemblance to nearby gas-rich green valley galaxies with low-level ongoing star formation.},

Green valley galaxies are found to have intermediate dust attenuation and reside in the middle of the regions occupied by quiescent and star-forming galaxies in the UVJ diagram. Compared with blue and red galaxy populations at z < 2, green galaxies have intermediate compactness and morphological parameters. The above findings seem to favor the scenario that green galaxies are at a transitional phase when star-forming galaxies are being quenched into quiescent status. The green galaxies at z < 2 show the highest AGN fraction, suggesting that AGN feedback may have played an important role in star formation quenching. For the massive galaxies at2 < z < 2.5, both red and green galaxies are found to have a similarly higher AGN fraction than the blue ones, which implies that AGN feedback may help to keep quiescence of red galaxies at z > 2. A significant environmental difference is found between green and red galaxies at z  0.5 seem to have similar local density distributions, suggesting that environment quenching is not the major mechanism to cease star formation at z  > 0.5. The fractions of three populations as functions of mass support a “downsizing” quenching picture that the bulk of star formation in more massive galaxies is completed earlier than that of lower-mass galaxies.},

  abstract      = {We explore observational and theoretical constraints on how galaxies might transition between the 'star-forming main sequence' (SFMS) and varying 'degrees of quiescence' out to z = 3. Our analysis is focused on galaxies with stellar mass M$_{*}$ $\gt$ 10$^{10}$ M$_{⊙}$, and is enabled by GAMA and CANDELS observations, a semi-analytic model (SAM) of galaxy formation, and a cosmological hydrodynamical 'zoom in' simulation with momentum-driven AGN feedback. In both the observations and the SAM, transition galaxies tend to have intermediate S{\'e}rsic indices, half-light radii, and surface stellar mass densities compared to star-forming and quiescent galaxies out to z = 3. We place an observational upper limit on the average population transition time-scale as a function of redshift, finding that the average high-redshift galaxy is on a 'fast track' for quenching whereas the average low-redshift galaxy is on a 'slow track' for quenching. We qualitatively identify four physical origin scenarios for transition galaxies in the SAM: oscillations on the SFMS, slow quenching, fast quenching, and rejuvenation. Quenching time-scales in both the SAM and the hydrodynamical simulation are not fast enough to reproduce the quiescent population that we observe at z {\sim} 3. In the SAM, we do not find a clear-cut morphological dependence of quenching time-scales, but we do predict that the mean stellar ages, cold gas fractions, SMBH (supermassive black hole) masses and halo masses of transition galaxies tend to be intermediate relative to those of star-forming and quiescent galaxies at z $\lt$ 3.},

We undertook new CO (2-1) observations of 22 Seyfert PSBs candidates using the ARO Submillimeter Telescope. This sample complements previous samples of PSBs by including green valley PSBs with Seyfert-like emission, allowing us to analyze for the first time the molecular gas properties of 116 PSBs with a variety of AGN properties. The distribution of molecular gas to stellar mass fractions in PSBs is significantly different than normal star-forming galaxies in the COLD GASS survey. The combined samples of PSBs with Seyfert-like emission line ratios have a gas fraction distribution which is even more significantly different and is broader (\~{} 0.03-0.3). Most of them have lower gas fractions than normal star-forming galaxies. We find a highly significant correlation between the WISE 12 micron to 4.6 micron flux ratios and molecular gas fractions in both PSBs and normal galaxies. We detect molecular gas in 27\% of our Seyfert PSBs. Taking into account the upper limits, the mean and the dispersion of the distribution of the gas fraction in our Seyfert PSB sample are much smaller (mean = 0.025, std dev. = 0.018) than previous samples of Seyfert PSBs or PSBs in general (mean \~{} 0.1 - 0.2, std dev. \~{} 0.1 - 0.2).},

  abstract      = {We present a new study investigating whether active galactic nuclei (AGN) beyond the local universe are preferentially fed via large-scale bars. Our investigation combines data from Chandra and Galaxy Zoo: Hubble (GZH) in the AEGIS, COSMOS, and GOODS-S surveys to create samples of face-on, disc galaxies at 0.2 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1.0. We use a novel method to robustly compare a sample of 120 AGN host galaxies, defined to have 10\^{}42 erg/s $\lt$ L\_X $\lt$ 10\^{}44 erg/s, with inactive control galaxies matched in stellar mass, rest-frame colour, size, Sersic index, and redshift. Using the GZH bar classifications of each sample, we demonstrate that AGN hosts show no statistically significant enhancement in bar fraction or average bar likelihood compared to closely-matched inactive galaxies. In detail, we find that the AGN bar fraction cannot be enhanced above the control bar fraction by more than a factor of two, at 99.7\% confidence. We similarly find no significant difference in the AGN fraction among barred and non-barred galaxies. Thus we find no compelling evidence that large-scale bars directly fuel AGN at 0.2$\lt$z$\lt$1.0. This result, coupled with previous results at z=0, implies that moderate-luminosity AGN have not been preferentially fed by large-scale bars since z=1. Furthermore, given the low bar fractions at z$\gt$1, our findings suggest that large-scale bars have likely never directly been a dominant fueling mechanism for supermassive black hole growth.},

  abstract      = {The bulk of the stellar growth over cosmic time is dominated by IR luminous galaxies at cosmic noon (z=1-2), many of which harbor a hidden active galactic nucleus (AGN). We use state of the art infrared color diagnostics, combining Spitzer and Herschel observations, to separate dust-obscured AGN from dusty star forming galaxies (SFGs) in the CANDELS and COSMOS surveys. We calculate 24 micron counts of SFGs, AGN/star forming ``Composites'', and AGN. AGN and Composites dominate the counts above 0.8 mJy at 24 micron, and Composites form at least 25\% of an IR sample even to faint detection limits. We develop methods to use the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on JWST to identify dust-obscured AGN and Composite galaxies from z\~{}1-2. With the sensitivity and spacing of MIRI filters, we will detect $\gt$4 times as many AGN hosts than with Spitzer/IRAC criteria. Any star formation rates based on the 7.7 micron PAH feature (likely to be applied to MIRI photometry) must be corrected for the contribution of the AGN, or the SFR will be overestimated by \~{}35\% for cases where the AGN provides half the IR luminosity and \~{}50\% when the AGN accounts for 90\% of the luminosity. Finally, we demonstrate that our MIRI color technique can select AGN with an Eddington ratio of $\lambda\_{\rm Edd}\sim0.01$ and will identify AGN hosts with a higher sSFR than X-ray techniques alone. JWST/MIRI will enable critical steps forward in identifying and understanding dust-obscured AGN and the link to their host galaxies.},

  abstract      = {We examine the host morphologies of heavily obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) at $z\sim1$ to test whether obscured supermassive black hole growth at this epoch is preferentially linked to galaxy mergers. Our sample consists of 154 obscured AGN with $N\_{\rm H}\gt10^{23.5}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $z\lt1.5$. Using visual classifications, we compare the morphologies of these AGN to control samples of moderately obscured ($10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ $\ltN\_{\rm H}\lt 10^{23.5}$ cm$^{-2}$) and unobscured ($N\_{\rm H}\lt10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) AGN. These control AGN are matched in redshift and intrinsic X-ray luminosity to our heavily obscured AGN. We find that heavily obscured AGN at z\~{}1 are twice as likely to be hosted by late-type galaxies relative to unobscured AGN ($65.3^{+4.1}\_{-4.6}\\%$ vs $34.5^{+2.9}\_{-2.7}\\%$) and three times as likely to exhibit merger or interaction signatures ($21.5^{+4.2}\_{-3.3}\\%$ vs $7.8^{+1.9}\_{-1.3}\\%$). The increased merger fraction is significant at the 3.8$\sigma$ level. We also find that the incidence of point-like morphologies is inversely proportional to obscuration. If we exclude all point sources and consider only extended hosts, we find the correlation between merger fraction and obscuration is still evident, however at a reduced statistical significance ($2.5\sigma$). The fact that we observe a different disk/spheroid fraction versus obscuration indicates that viewing angle cannot be the only thing differentiating our three AGN samples, as a simple unification model would suggest. The increased fraction of disturbed morphologies with obscuration supports an evolutionary scenario, in which Compton-thick AGN are a distinct phase of obscured SMBH growth following a merger/interaction event. Our findings also suggest that some of the merger-triggered SMBH growth predicted by recent AGN fueling models may be hidden among the heavily obscured, Compton-thick population.},

  abstract = {Forward modeling of the full galaxy SED is a powerful technique, providing self-consistent constraints on stellar ages, dust properties, and metallicities. However, the accuracy of these results is contingent on the accuracy of the model. One significant source of uncertainty is the contribution of obscured AGN, as they are relatively common and can produce substantial mid-IR (MIR) emission. Here we include emission from dusty AGN torii in the Prospector SED-fitting framework, and fit the UV–IR broadband photometry of 129 nearby galaxies. We find that 10% of the fitted galaxies host an AGN contributing >10% of the observed galaxy MIR luminosity. We demonstrate the necessity of this AGN component in the following ways. First, we compare observed spectral features to spectral features predicted from our model fit to the photometry. We find that the AGN component greatly improves predictions for observed H α and H β luminosities, as well as mid-infrared Akari and Spitzer /IRS spectra. Second, we show that inclusion of the AGN component changes stellar ages and SFRs by up to a factor of 10, and dust attenuations by up to a factor of 2.5. Finally, we show that the strength of our model AGN component correlates with independent AGN indicators, suggesting that these galaxies truly host AGN. Notably, only 46% of the SED-detected AGN would be detected with a simple MIR color selection. Based on these results, we conclude that SED models which fit MIR data without AGN components are vulnerable to substantial bias in their derived parameters.},

We derive detailed distributions of structural parameters and FIR luminosities from carefully constructed control samples of galaxies, which we then compare to those of the AGNs. At z\~{}1, AGNs show slightly diskier light profiles than massive inactive (non-AGN) galaxies, as well as modestly higher levels of gross galaxy disturbance (as measured by visual signatures of interactions and clumpy structure). In contrast, at z\~{}2, AGNs show similar levels of galaxy disturbance as inactive galaxies, but display a red central light enhancement, which may arise due to a more pronounced bulge in AGN hosts or due to extinguished nuclear light. We undertake a number of tests of these alternatives, but our results do not strongly favour one interpretation over the other. The mean SFR and its distribution among AGNs and inactive galaxies are similar at z$\gt$1.5. At z$\lt$1, however, clear and significant enhancements are seen in the SFRs of AGNs with bulge-dominated light profiles. These trends suggest an evolution in the relation between nuclear activity and host properties with redshift, towards a minor role for mergers and interactions at z$\gt$1.5.},

We select galaxies undergoing gravitational instabilities using the number of clumps and degree of patchiness as proxies. The CANDELS visual classification system is used to identify 44 clumpy disk galaxies, along with mass-matched comparison samples of smooth and intermediate morphology galaxies. We note that, despite being being mass-matched and having similar star formation rates, the smoother galaxies tend to be smaller disks with more prominent bulges compared to the clumpy galaxies. The lack of smooth extended disks is probably a general feature of the z\~{}2 galaxy population, and means we cannot directly compare with the clumpy and smooth extended disks observed at lower redshift. We find that z\~{}2 clumpy galaxies have slightly enhanced AGN fractions selected by integrated line ratios (in the mass-excitation method), but the spatially resolved line ratios indicate this is likely due to extended phenomena rather than nuclear AGNs. Meanwhile the X-ray data show that clumpy, smooth, and intermediate galaxies have nearly indistinguishable AGN fractions derived from both individual detections and stacked non-detections. The data demonstrate that AGN fueling modes at z\~{}1.85 - whether violent disk instabilities or secular processes - are as efficient in smooth galaxies as they are in clumpy galaxies.},

We study galactic winds in the stacked spectrum of 560 AGN PSBs and that of a control sample of star-forming galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Using a two component (inter-stellar +wind) absorption-line model of the $\backslash$ion$\{$Na$\}$$\{$i$\}$ doublet, and after accounting for the stellar photospheric absorption, we find that the AGN PSBs have a centroid wind velocity shift of $-252^{+64}\_{-57}$ km s$^{-1}$ and a maximum blueshift velocity of $-678^{+54}\_{-53}$ km s$^{-1}$. In comparison, the control sample, which is matched with the AGN PSBs in redshift, stellar mass, axis-ratio, the 4000 $\{$$\backslash$AA$\}$ break index, Balmer decrement, and WISE 12 $\mu$m to 4.6 $\mu$m flux ratio, has a centroid wind velocity shift of $-119^{+33}\_{-41}$ km s$^{-1}$ and a maximum velocity of $-406^{+51}\_{-61}$ km s$^{-1}$. The equivalent widths due to the winds in both samples are similar: $0.36^{+0.10}\_{-0.07}$ $\{$$\backslash$AA$\}$ for the AGN PSBs and $0.24^{+0.07}\_{-0.06} $ $\{$$\backslash$AA$\}$ for the control sample. Despite having a higher velocity, the observed winds in the AGN PSBs are still not powerful enough to sweep significant amounts of gas out of the halos of the host galaxies.

  abstract      = {We study winds in 12 X-ray AGN host galaxies at z \~{} 1. We find, using the low-ionization Fe II 2586 absorption in the stacked spectra, that the probability distribution function (PDF) of the centroid velocity shift in AGN has a median, 16th and 84th percentiles of (-87, -251, +86) km/s respectively. The PDF of the velocity dispersion in AGN has a median, 84th and 16th percentile of (139, 253, 52) km/s respectively. The centroid velocity and the velocity dispersions are obtained from a two component (ISM+wind) absorption line model. The equivalent width PDF of the outflow in AGN has median, 84th and 16th percentiles of (0.4, 0.8, 0.1) Angstrom. There is a strong ISM component in Fe II 2586 absorption with (1.2, 1.5, 0.8) Angstrom, implying presence of substantial amount cold gas in the host galaxies. For comparison, star-forming and X-ray undetected galaxies at a similar redshift, matched roughly in stellar mass and galaxy inclination, have a centroid velocity PDF with percentiles of (-74, -258, +90) km/s, and a velocity dispersion PDF percentiles of (150, 259, 57) km/s. Thus, winds in the AGN are similar to star-formation-driven winds, and are too weak to escape and expel substantial cool gas from galaxies. Our sample doubles the previous sample of AGN studied at z \~{} 0.5 and extends the analysis to z \~{} 1. A joint reanalysis of the z \~{} 0.5 AGN sample and our sample yields consistent results to the measurements above.},

Of the 6287 radio sources in XXL-S, 4758 (75.7%) were cross-matched to an optical counterpart using the likelihood ratio technique.

A number of multiwavelength diagnostics, including X-ray luminosities, mid-infrared colours, spectral energy distribution fits, radio luminosities, and optical emission lines and colours, were used to classify the sources into three types: low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs), high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs), and star-forming galaxies (SFGs). The final sample contains 1729 LERGs (36.3%), 1159 radio-loud HERGs (24.4%), 296 radio-quiet HERGs (6.2%), 558 SFGs (11.7%), and 1016 unclassified sources (21.4%). The LERGs tend to exist in the most massive galaxies with low star formation rates and redder colours, whereas the HERGs and SFGs exist in galaxies of lower mass, higher star formation rates, and bluer colours. The fraction of blue host galaxies is higher for radio-quiet HERGs than for radio-loud HERGs. LERGs and radio-loud HERGs are found at all radio luminosities, but radio-loud HERGs tend to be more radio luminous than LERGs at a given redshift. These results are consistent with the emerging picture in which LERGs exist in the most massive quiescent galaxies typically found in clusters with hot X-ray halos and HERGs are associated with ongoing star formation in their host galaxies via the accretion of cold gas.},

  abstract = {Results are reported from an analysis of the structural properties of dynamically hot galaxies which combines central velocity dispersion, effective surface brightness, and effective radius into a new 3-space (k), in which the axes are parameters that are physically meaningful. Hot galaxies are found to divide into groups in k-space that closely parallel conventional morphological classifications, namely, luminous ellipticals, compacts, bulges, bright dwarfs, and dwarf spheroidals. A major sequence is defined by luminous ellipticals, bulges, and most compacts, which together constitute a smooth continuum in k-space. Several properties vary smoothly with mass along this continuum, including bulge-to-disk ratio, radio properties, rotation, degree of velocity anisotropy, and 'unrelaxed'. A second major sequence is comprised of dwarf ellipticals and dwarf spheroidals. It is suggested that mass loss is a major factor in hot dwarf galaxies, but the dwarf sequence cannot be simply a mass-loss sequence, as it has the wrong direction in k-space.},

We model the full radial extent of their light profiles by simultaneously fitting a point-spread function (PSF) convolved Sérsic R 1/ n model and, when necessary, either a central point source or a central PSF-convolved Gaussian. Nucleation was detected in all but two of our final sample of 15 dE galaxies. When detected, the luminosities of the central component, L nuc , scale with the host galaxy luminosity L gal such that L nuc = 10 4.76±0.10 ( L gal /10 7 ) 0.87±0.26 . We confirm that the light profiles of the underlying host galaxies display systematic departures from an exponential model that are correlated with the model-independent host galaxy luminosity and are not due to biasing from the nuclear component. The Pearson correlation coefficient between log n and central galaxy surface brightness μ 0 (excluding the flux from extraneous central components) is -0.83 at a significance level of 99.99%. Excluding one outlier, the Pearson correlation coefficient between the logarithm of the Sérsic index n and the host galaxy magnitude is -0.77 at a significance of 99.9%. We explain the observed relationship between dE galaxy luminosity and the inner logarithmic profile slope γ' as a by-product of the correlation between luminosity and Sérsic index n . Including, from the literature, an additional 232 dE and E galaxies spanning 10 mag in absolute magnitude M , the dE galaxies are shown to display a continuous sequence with the brighter E galaxies, such that μ 0 brightens linearly with M until core formation causes the most luminous ( M B ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} -20.5) E galaxies to deviate from this relation.

The oxygen abundance in these galaxies is very low, varying in the range 12 + log O/H = 7.36–7.99. Such extraordinarily high broad Hα luminosities cannot be accounted for by massive stars at different stages of their evolution. By comparing these with the first-epoch SDSS spectra, we find that the broad Hα luminosities have remained constant over a period of 3-7 yr, which probably excludes Type IIn supernovae as a possible mechanism of broad emission. The emission most likely comes from accretion disks around intermediate-mass black holes, with lower mass limits in the range ~ 5 × 10 5 - 3 × 10 6 M ☉ . If this is the case, these four objects form a new class of very low metallicity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that have been elusive until now. The absence of the strong high-ionization lines [Ne V] λ3426 and He II λ4686 can be understood if the nonthermal radiation contributes less than ~10% of the total ionizing radiation.},

With deep $BVI$ images from the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network Supernova Program, SBPs of 38 dwarfs in the NGC 2784 group are fitted by a single exponential or double exponential model. We find that 53% of the dwarfs are fitted with single exponential profiles ("Type I"), while 47% of the dwarfs show double exponential profiles. 37% of all dwarfs have smaller sizes of the outer part than inner part ("Type II"), while 10% have a larger sized outer than inner part ("Type III"). We compare these results with those in the field and in the Virgo cluster, where SBP types of 102 field dwarfs are compiled from a previous study and SBP types of 375 cluster dwarfs are measured using SDSS $r$-band images. As a result, the distributions of SBP types are different in three environments. Common SBP types of the field, the NGC 2784 group, and the Virgo cluster are Type II, Type I and II, and Type I and III profiles, respectively. After comparing sizes of dwarfs in different environments, we suggest that since sizes of some dwarfs are changed due to the environmental effects, SBP types are able to be transformed and the distributions of SBP types in three environments are different. We discuss possible environmental mechanisms on the transformation of SBP types.},

We find a wide range of morphological diversity for these ULIRGs, from ellipsoids to multiple bright nuclei or diffuse structures, e.g., the double nuclei, gaseous bridges, dual asym- metries, irregular or elliptical structures. In order to study the morphology of these ULIRGs quantitatively, their morphological parameters (the Gini coeffcient G and moment index M$_{20}$) are measured in the rest-frame optical wave- band. Compared with the low-redshift counterparts, the high-redshift ULIRGs show a smaller value of G and a larger value of M$_{20}$, indicating a less concen- tricity and a larger asymmetry of the stellar population distribution in these ULIRGs. Based on a 2-D fitting of the brightness profiles of these ULIRGs, we have derived their effective radii, which are distributed in a range from 2.4 to kpc, with a mean value of (3.9 {\plusmn} 1.1) kpc. Moreover, we find that in average the sizes of the high-redshift ULIRGs are one to two times smaller than those of the nearby star-forming galaxies of analogous stellar mass. Our results are consistent with those of other studies under the similar conditions of redshift and infrared luminosity.},

  abstract      = {Observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope have revealed a population of red-sequence galaxies with a significant excess in their 24-micron emission compared to what is expected from an old stellar population. We identify 900 red galaxies with 0.15$\lt$z$\lt$0.3 from the AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey (AGES) selected from the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey Bootes field. Using Spitzer/MIPS, we classify 89 (\~{}10\%) with 24-micron infrared excess (f24$\gt$0.3 mJy). We determine the prevalence of AGN and star-formation activity in all the AGES galaxies using optical line diagnostics and mid-IR color-color criteria. Using the IRAC color-color diagram from the IRAC Shallow Survey, we find that 64\% of the 24-micron excess red galaxies are likely to have strong PAH emission features in the 8-micron IRAC band. This fraction is significantly larger than the 5\% of red galaxies with f24$\lt$0.3 mJy that are estimated to have strong PAH emission, suggesting that the infrared emission is largely due to star-formation processes. Only 15\% of the 24-micron excess red galaxies have optical line diagnostics characteristic of star-formation (64\% are classified as AGN and 21\% are unclassifiable). The difference between the optical and infrared results suggest that both AGN and star-formation activity is occurring simultaneously in many of the 24-micron excess red galaxies. These results should serve as a warning to studies that exclusively use optical line diagnostics to determine the dominant emission mechanism in the infrared and other bands. We find that \~{}40\% of the 24-micron excess red galaxies are edge-on spiral galaxies with high optical extinctions. The remaining sources are likely to be red galaxies whose 24-micron emission comes from a combination of obscured AGN and star-formation activity.},

  abstract      = {We present the X-ray properties of the extremely red objects (ERO) population observed by Chandra with three partially overlapping pointings (up to {\ap}90 ks) over an area of {\ap}500 arcmin$^{2}$, down to a 0.5-8 keV flux limit of {\ap}10$^{-15}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. We selected EROs using a multi-band photometric catalog down to a KS-band magnitude of {\ap}19.3 (Vega system); 14 EROs were detected in X-rays, corresponding to {\ap}9\% of the overall X-ray source population (149 X-ray sources) and to {\ap}5\% of the ERO population (288). The X-ray emission of all X-ray detected EROs is consistent with that of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) ({\gap} 3.5{\times}10$^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at photometric redshifts z $\gt$ 1), in agreement with previous X-ray observations, with an indication of increasing absorption between the three X-ray brightest EROs and the 11 X-ray faintest EROs. We take advantage of the good spatial resolution and limited background provided by Chandra to place constraints on the population of the X-ray undetected EROs by a stacking analysis. Their stacked emission, whose statistical significance is 5.7{$\sigma$} in the observed 0.5-8 keV band, provides an upper limit to the average intrinsic absorption at z = 1 of 2.5{\times}10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and corresponds to a rest-frame 0.5-8 keV luminosity of 8.9{\times}10$^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We estimate that any accretion-related X-ray emission to the stacked signal is likely {\ldquo}diluted{\rdquo} by emission due to hot gas in normal galaxies and star-formation activity in dust-enshrouded galaxies at high redshift.

Our sample includes \~{}5300 EROs with i - K $_{s}$ $\gt$= 2.45 (AB, equivalently I - K $_{s}$ = 4 in Vega) and K $_{s}$ $\lt$= 21.1 (AB). For EROs in our sample, we compute, using the ACS F814W images, their concentration, asymmetry, as well as their Gini coefficient and the second moment of the brightest 20\% of their light. Using those morphology parameters and the Spitzer IRAC [3.6] - [8.0] color, the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting method, we classify EROs into two classes: old galaxies (OGs) and young, dusty starburst galaxies (DGs). We found that the fraction of OGs and DGs in our sample is similar, about 48\% of EROs in our sample are OGs, and 52\% of them are DGs. To reduce the redundancy of these three different classification methods, we performed a principal component analysis on the measurements of EROs, and find that morphology parameters and SEDs are efficient in segregating OGs and DGs. The [3.6] - [8.0] color, which depends on reddening, redshift, and photometric accuracy, is difficult to separate EROs around the discriminating line between starburst and elliptical. We investigate the dependence of the fraction of EROs on their observational properties, and the results suggest that DGs become increasingly important at fainter magnitudes, redder colors, and higher redshifts. The clustering of the entire EROs, DGs, and OGs was estimated by calculating their correlation function, and we find that the clustering of EROs is much stronger than that of full K-limited samples of galaxies; the clustering amplitude of OGs is a factor of \~{}2 larger than that of DGs.},

  abstract      = {We present a study on physical properties for a large distant red galaxy (DRG) sample, using the K-selected multi-band photometry catalog of the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field and the CANDELS near-infrared data. Our sample includes 4485 DRGs with (J - K)$_{AB}$ $\gt$ 1.16 and K$_{AB}$ $\lt$ 23.4 mag, and 132 DRGs have HST/WFC3 morphological measurements. The results of nonparametric measurements of DRG morphology are consistent with our rest-frame UVJ color classification; quiescent DRGs are generally compact while star-forming DRGs tend to have extended structures. We find the star formation rate (SFR) and the stellar mass of star-forming DRGs present tight ``main sequence'' relations in all redshift bins. Moreover, the specific SFR (sSFR) of DRGs increases with redshift in all stellar mass bins and DRGs with higher stellar masses generally have lower sSFRs, which indicates that galaxies were much more active on average in the past, and star formation contributes more to the mass growth of low-mass galaxies than to high-mass galaxies. The infrared-derived SFR dominates the total SFR of DRGs which occupy the high-mass range, implying that the J - K color criterion effectively selects massive and dusty galaxies. DRGs with higher M$_{*}$ generally have redder (U - V)$_{rest}$ colors, and the (U - V)$_{rest}$ colors of DRGs become bluer at higher redshifts, suggesting high-mass galaxies have higher internal dust extinctions or older stellar ages and they evolve with time. Finally, we find that DRGs have different overlap among extremely red objects, BzK galaxies, IRAC-selected extremely red objects, and high-z ultraluminous infrared galaxies, indicating that DRGs are not a special population and they can also be selected by other color criteria.},

  abstract      = {We report optical properties of infrared (IR)-bright dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) that are defined as (i-[22])\_AB $\gt$ 7.0. Since supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in IR-bright DOGs are expected to be rapidly growing in the major merger scenario, they provide useful clues to understand the co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies. However the optical properties of IR-bright DOGs are still unclear, because the optical emission of DOGs is very faint. By combining \~{} 53 deg\^{}2 images of the optical, near-IR, and mid-IR data that are obtained with the Subaru Hyper Suprime Cam (HSC) survey, VISTA VIKING survey, and WISE all-sky survey, respectively, 427 IR-bright DOGs are selected. We find that IR-bright DOGs show a redder (g-z)\_AB color than other populations of dusty galaxies such as ultra-luminous IR galaxies (ULIRGs) at a similar redshift, with a significantly large dispersion. Among the selected DOGs, star-formation (SF)-dominated DOGs show a relatively red color while active galactic nucleus (AGN)-dominated DOGs show a rather blue color in optical. This result is consistent with the idea that the relative AGN contribution in the optical emission becomes more significant at a late stage in the major merger scenario. Roughly 2\% of AGN-dominated DOGs show a significant blue excess in blue HSC bands (BluDOGs), which can be interpreted as a leaked AGN emission as proposed for some blue-excess Hot DOGs in earlier works.},

Recent observations and circumstantial evidence suggest that these galaxies are the likely progenitors of the earliest generation of massive, quiescent galaxies. I will discuss recent efforts to detect and resolve the gas and dust on sub-kiloparsec scales using observations of gravitationally lensed dusty galaxies discovered by the South Pole Telescope conducted by ALMA and other facilities. These observations demonstrate the richness of the molecular ISM, shed light on the relative distribution of star formation and the gas from which stars form, and offer a unique window into the evolution of dusty galaxies. Finally, I will present new ALMA observations which show signs of feedback on the molecular ISM in dusty star-forming galaxies at z\~{}6, providing tantalizing evidence of an evolutionary connection between high-redshift dusty galaxies and the first massive, quiescent systems.},

  abstract = {In this dissertation, I study various aspects related to the gas and star formation in dusty star-forming galaxies in the distant universe. My dissertation is heavily based on observations made by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), observing a sample of gravitationally lensed high-redshift dusty galaxies originally discovered by the South Pole Telescope (SPT). In addition to the introductions to the individual chapters, Chapter 1 provides a broader background to the study of these objects and places them in the overall context of galaxy evolution. In Chapter 2 I describe a technique designed to search for faint molecular lines in the spectrum of high-redshift dusty galaxies. The brightest molecular lines in the spectra of these objects are due to carbon monoxide, but a host of other species are present in the interstellar media. These other molecules trace gas of a wide range of temperatures and densities, but are generally ten times fainter than the brighter CO lines. I detected several other molecular lines, and used them to characterize the conditions of the interstellar gas. This work was published in Spilker et al. (2014). In Chapter 3, I describe a technique for modeling the effects of gravitational lensing which is optimized for data from interferometers such as ALMA. Using these models and data for a large sample of objects from ALMA, I studied the intrinsic properties of the sample such as the source sizes and luminosities. I used these intrinsic properties to revisit topics from the literature which benefit from the additional size information I determined. This work was published in Spilker et al. (2016). In Chapter 4, I use the modeling technique I developed to investigate the relationship between the star formation and the cold molecular gas from which stars form in two objects selected from the SPT sample. Using the models of the source, I was able to determine the mass of molecular gas in these objects using several independent methods. I found that the molecular gas reservoirs are more extended than the star formation, which has implications for the ``law'' used as a prescription for star formation in many simulations. This work was published in Spilker et al. (2015). Chapter 5 describes ongoing work to determine what will happen to the dusty galaxies after their active phase of star formation ends, and what processes dominate that change. Since their discovery, these dusty galaxies have been thought to be progenitors of early quiescent galaxies. In this chapter, I show observations of a massive molecular outflow from a single object, which may be responsible for removing the raw material for star formation. Finally, in Chapter 6, I end with a summary of this dissertation.},

The majority of these IEROs are proved to be at 1.4 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2.5 with typical stellar mass of {\tilde} 10$^{11}$Mmsol. In particular, we show that they dominate the high-mass end of the stellar mass function, and contribute {\tilde} 90\% of all the most massive (M$_{*}$ $\gt$ 1 {\times} 10$^{11}$M$_{⊙}$) galaxies at the redshift interval. We show these galaxies can be cleanly separated into old and dusty galaxies using simple H - [8.0] color: the old galaxies primarily have H - [8.0] $\lt$ 1.2 and the dusty galaxies are much redder.  Such a classification scheme is further shown to be broadly consistent with that using MIPS 24 {$\mu$}m, rest-frame U-V and V-J color and SSP fitting.  In addition, with new NIR imaging from HST/WFC3 we show that  these massive old and dusty galaxies exhibit distinct morphologies: the old galaxies are primarily compact and spheroidal whereas the dusty galaxies  show more extended and disturbed morphologies.  With the clean and consistent separation between old and dusty galaxies, we derive the fraction of quiescent massive galaxies to be {\tilde} 25\%, which is the same if we only take the most massive galaxies into account.},

  abstract = {Dust-enshrouded, starbursting, submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) at z ≥ 3 have been proposed as progenitors of z ≥ 2 compact quiescent galaxies (cQGs). To test this connection, we present a detailed spatially resolved study of the stars, dust, and stellar mass in a sample of six submillimeter-bright starburst galaxies at z ∼ 4.5. The stellar UV emission probed by HST is extended and irregular and shows evidence of multiple components. Informed by HST , we deblend Spitzer /IRAC data at rest-frame optical, finding that the systems are undergoing minor mergers with a typical stellar mass ratio of 1:6.5. The FIR dust continuum emission traced by ALMA locates the bulk of star formation in extremely compact regions (median r e = 0.70 ± 0.29 kpc), and it is in all cases associated with the most massive component of the mergers (median ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/856/2/121/apjaab206ieqn1.gif] {$\mathrm{log}({M}_{* }/{M}_{\odot })=10.49\pm 0.32$} ). We compare spatially resolved UV slope ( β ) maps with the FIR dust continuum to study the infrared excess(IRX = L IR / L UV )– β relation. The SMGs display systematically higher IRX values than expected from the nominal trend, demonstrating that the FIR and UV emissions are spatially disconnected. Finally, we show that the SMGs fall on the mass–size plane at smaller stellar masses and sizes than the cQGs at z = 2. Taking into account the expected evolution in stellar mass and size between z = 4.5 and z = 2 due to the ongoing starburst and mergers with minor companions, this is in agreement with a direct evolutionary connection between the two populations.},

  abstract    = {We present deep high resolution (0.03", 200pc) ALMA Band 7 observations covering the dust continuum and [CII] $\lambda157.7\mu$m emission in four $z\sim4.4-4.8$ sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs) selected from the ALESS and AS2UDS surveys. The data show that the rest-frame 160$\mu$m (observed 345 GHz) dust emission is consistent with smooth morphologies on kpc scales for three of the sources. One source, UDS47.0, displays apparent substructure but this is also consistent with a smooth morphology, as indicated by simulations showing that smooth exponential disks can appear clumpy when observed at high angular resolution (0.03") and depth of these observations ($\sigma_{345\text{GHz}} \sim27-47\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$). The four SMGs are bright [CII] emitters, and we extract [CII] spectra from the high resolution data, and recover $\sim20-100$% of the [CII] flux and $\sim40-80$% of the dust continuum emission, compared to the previous lower resolution observations. When tapered to 0.2" resolution our maps recover $\sim80-100$% of the continuum emission, indicating that $\sim60$% of the emission is resolved out on $\sim200$pc scales. We find that the [CII] emission in high-redshift galaxies is more spatially extended than the rest-frame 160$\mu$m dust continuum by a factor of $1.6\pm0.4$. By considering the $L_{\text{[CII]}}$/$L_{\text{FIR}}$ ratio as a function of the star-formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\text{SFR}}$) we revisit the [CII] deficit, and suggest that the decline in the $L_{\text{[CII]}}$/$L_{\text{FIR}}$ ratio as a function of $\Sigma_{\text{SFR}}$ is consistent with local processes. We also explore the physical drivers that may be responsible for these trends and can give rise to the properties found in the densest regions of SMGs.},

  abstract = {Identifications are sought for 12 submillimeter sources detected in a deep submillimeter survey. Six are securely identified, two have probable identifications, and four remain unidentified with I AB > 25. Spectroscopic and estimated photometric redshifts indicate that four of the sources have z < 1 and four have 1 3. The spectral energy distributions of the identifications, as defined by measurements or upper limits to the flux densities at 8000 Å, at 15, 450, 850 μm, and at 6 cm, are consistent with the spectral energy distributions of high-extinction starbursts such as Arp 220. The far-IR luminosities of the sources at z > 0.5 are of order 3 × 10 12 h -2 50 L ☉ , i.e., slightly larger than that of Arp 220. As with local ultraluminous infrared galaxies, the optical luminosities of the identified galaxies are comparable to present-day L* , and the optical morphologies of many of the galaxies show evidence for mergers or highly disruptive interactions. Based on this small sample, the cumulative bolometric luminosity function shows strong evolution to z ~1, but weaker or possibly even negative evolution beyond. The redshift dependence of the far-IR luminosity density does not appear, at this early stage, to be inconsistent with that seen in the ultraviolet luminosity density. Although the computation of bolometric luminosities is quite uncertain, the population of very luminous galaxies that is detected in the surveys at z > 1 is already matching, in the far-IR, the bolometric output in the ultraviolet of the whole optically selected population. Assuming that the energy source in the far-IR is massive stars, this suggests that the total luminous output from star formation in the universe will be dominated by the far-IR emission once the lower luminosity sources, below the current far-IR detection threshold, are included. Furthermore, the detected systems have individual star formation rates (exceeding 300 h -2 50 M ☉ yr -1 ) that are much higher than seen in the ultraviolet-selected samples and that are sufficient to form substantial stellar populations on dynamical timescales of 10 8 yr. The association with mergerlike morphologies and the obvious presence of dust makes it attractive to identify these systems as forming the metal-rich spheroid population, in which case we would infer that much of this activity has occurred relatively recently, at z ~2.},

  abstract      = {Submillimetre-bright galaxies at high redshift are the most luminous, heavily star-forming galaxies in the Universe and are characterized by prodigious emission in the far-infrared, with a flux of at least five millijanskys at a wavelength of 850 micrometres. They reside in haloes with masses about 10$^{13}$ times that of the Sun, have low gas fractions compared to main-sequence disks at a comparable redshift, trace complex environments and are not easily observable at optical wavelengths. Their physical origin remains unclear. Simulations have been able to form galaxies with the requisite luminosities, but have otherwise been unable to simultaneously match the stellar masses, star formation rates, gas fractions and environments. Here we report a cosmological hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulation that is able to form a submillimetre galaxy that simultaneously satisfies the broad range of observed physical constraints. We find that groups of galaxies residing in massive dark matter haloes have increasing rates of star formation that peak at collective rates of about 500-1,000 solar masses per year at redshifts of two to three, by which time the interstellar medium is sufficiently enriched with metals that the region may be observed as a submillimetre-selected system. The intense star formation rates are fuelled in part by the infall of a reservoir gas supply enabled by stellar feedback at earlier times, not through major mergers. With a lifetime of nearly a billion years, our simulations show that the submillimetre-bright phase of high-redshift galaxies is prolonged and associated with significant mass buildup in early-Universe proto-clusters, and that many submillimetre-bright galaxies are composed of numerous unresolved components (for which there is some observational evidence).},

The velocity fields of our sources, traced by the $^{12}$CO($J$=3-2) emission, are consistent with disk rotation to first order, implying average dynamical masses of $\sim$3$\times10^{11}$M$_{\odot}$ within two half-light radii. Through a Bayesian approach we investigate the uncertainties inherent to dynamically constraining total gas masses. We explore the covariance between the stellar mass-to-light ratio and CO-to-H$_{2}$ conversion factor, $\alpha_{\rm CO}$, finding values of $\alpha_{\rm CO}=1.1^{+0.8}_{-0.7}$ for dark matter fractions of 15 \%. We show that the resolved spatial distribution of the gas and dust continuum can be uncorrelated to the stellar emission, challenging energy balance assumptions in global SED fitting. Through a stacking analysis of the resolved radial profiles of the CO(3-2), stellar and dust continuum emission in SMG samples, we find that the cool molecular gas emission in these sources (radii $\sim$5--14 kpc) is clearly more extended than the rest-frame $\sim$250 $\mu$m dust continuum by a factor $>2$. We propose that assuming a constant dust-to-gas ratio, this apparent difference in sizes can be explained by temperature and optical-depth gradients alone. Our results suggest that caution must be exercised when extrapolating morphological properties of dust continuum observations to conclusions about the molecular gas phase of the ISM.},

The new data reveal for the first time spatially resolved CO gas kinematics in the observed SMGs. Two of the SMGs show double or multiple morphologies, with complex, disturbed gas motions. The other two SMGs exhibit CO velocity gradients of ~500 km s −1 across ≤0.2 '' (1.6 kpc) diameter regions, suggesting that the star-forming gas is in compact, rotating disks. Our data provide compelling evidence that these SMGs represent extreme, short-lived "maximum" star-forming events in highly dissipative mergers of gas-rich galaxies. The resulting high-mass surface and volume densities of SMGs are similar to those of compact quiescent galaxies in the same redshift range and much higher than those in local spheroids. From the ratio of the comoving volume densities of SMGs and quiescent galaxies in the same mass and redshift ranges, and from the comparison of gas exhaustion timescales and stellar ages, we estimate that the SMG phase duration is about 100 Myr. Our analysis of SMGs and optically/UV selected high-redshift star-forming galaxies supports a "universal" Chabrier IMF as being valid over the star-forming history of these galaxies. We find that the 12 CO luminosity to total gas mass conversion factors at z ~ 2-3 are probably similar to those assumed at z ~ 0. The implied gas fractions in our sample galaxies range from 20% to 50%.},

Some studies conclude that UDGs reside in massive dark matter halos while others, controversially, argue for the existence of UDGs with no dark matter at all. Here we show that these results arise because the uncertainties of these mass estimates have been substantially underestimated. Indeed, applying the same procedure to the well-studied Fornax dwarf spheroidal would conclude that it has an ``overmassive'' dark halo or, alternatively, that it lacks dark matter. We corroborate our argument with self- consistent mocks of tracers in cosmological halos, showing that masses from samples with $5 \lt N \lt 10$ tracers (assuming no measurement errors) are uncertain by at least an order of magnitude. Finally, we estimate masses of UDGs with HST imaging in Coma and show that their recent mass measurements (with adequate uncertainties) are in agreement with that of other dwarfs, such as Fornax.. We also provide bias and scatter factors for a range of sample sizes and measurement errors, of wider applicability.},

We determine the UV-continuum slope β in these galaxies, and compare the slopes with galaxies at later times to measure the evolution in β. For luminous L * z =3 galaxies, we measure a mean UV-continuum slope β of –2.0 ± 0.2, which is comparable to the β ~ –2 derived at similar luminosities at z ~ 5-6. However, for the lower luminosity 0.1 L * z =3 galaxies, we measure a mean β of –3.0 ± 0.2. This is substantially bluer than is found for similar luminosity galaxies at z ~ 4, just 800 Myr later, and even at z ~ 5-6. In principle, the observed β of –3.0 can be matched by a very young, dust-free stellar population, but when nebular emission is included the expected β becomes ≥–2.7. To produce these very blue βs (i.e., β ~ –3), extremely low metallicities and mechanisms to reduce the red nebular emission seem to be required. For example, a large escape fraction (i.e., f esc ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 0.3) could minimize the contribution from this red nebular emission. If this is correct and the escape fraction in faint z ~ 7 galaxies is ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 0.3, it may help to explain how galaxies reionize the universe.},

Using the HST/ACS and HST/WFC3 imaging data taken as a part of the CANDELS project, for each galaxy we perform SED fitting per resolution element, producing resolved rest-frame U-V color, stellar mass, star formation rate, age and extinction maps. We develop a technique to identify blue and red ``regions'' within individual galaxies, using their rest-frame color maps. As expected, for any given galaxy, the red regions are found to have higher stellar mass surface densities and older ages compared to the blue regions. Furthermore, we quantify the spatial distribution of red and blue regions with respect to both redshift and stellar mass, finding that the stronger concentration of red regions toward the centers of galaxies is not a significant function of either redshift or stellar mass. We find that the ``main sequence'' of star forming galaxies exists among both red and blue regions inside galaxies, with the median of blue regions forming a tighter relation with a slope of 1.1+/-0.1 and a scatter of \~{}0.2 dex compared to red regions with a slope of 1.3+/-0.1 and a scatter of \~{}0.6 dex. The blue regions show higher specific Star Formation Rates (sSFR) than their red counterparts with the sSFR decreasing since z\~{}1, driver primarily by the stellar mass surface densities rather than the SFRs at a giver resolution element.},

The optical/NIR and far-IR Spitzer/Herschel colors indicate that most compact SFGs are heavily obscured. Nearly half (47\%) host an X-ray-bright active galactic nucleus (AGN). In contrast, only about 10\% of other massive galaxies at that time host AGNs. Compact SFGs have centrally concentrated light profiles and spheroidal morphologies similar to quiescent galaxies and are thus strikingly different from other SFGs, which typically are disk-like and sometimes clumpy or irregular. Most compact SFGs lie either within the star formation rate (SFR)-mass main sequence (65\%) or below it (30\%), on the expected evolutionary path toward quiescent galaxies. These results show conclusively that galaxies become more compact before they lose their gas and dust, quenching star formation. Using extensive HST photometry from CANDELS and grism spectroscopy from the 3D-HST survey, we model their stellar populations with either exponentially declining ({$\tau$}) star formation histories (SFHs) or physically motivated SFHs drawn from semianalytic models (SAMs). SAMs predict longer formation timescales and older ages \~{}2 Gyr, which are nearly twice as old as the estimates of the {$\tau$} models. Both models yield good spectral energy distribution fits, indicating that the systematic uncertainty in the age due to degeneracies in the SFH is of that order of magnitude. However, SAM SFHs better match the observed slope and zero point of the SFR-mass main sequence. Contrary to expectations, some low-mass compact SFGs (log(M/M $_{⊙}$) =10-10.6) have younger ages but lower specific SFRs than that of more massive galaxies, suggesting that the low-mass galaxies reach the red sequence faster. If the progenitors of compact SFGs are extended SFGs, state-of-the-art SAMs show that mergers and disk instabilities (DIs) are both able to shrink galaxies, but DIs are more frequent (60\% versus 40\%) and form more concentrated galaxies. We confirm this result via high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations.},

We match samples at different redshifts in UV luminosity and stellar mass, and perform systematic measurements of spectral features and stellar population modeling. By creating composite spectra grouped according to Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW), and various galaxy properties, we study the evolutionary trends among Ly$\alpha$, low- and high-ionization interstellar (LIS and HIS) absorption features, and integrated galaxy properties. We also examine the redshift evolution of Ly$\alpha$ and LIS absorption kinematics, and fine-structure emission EWs. The connections among the strengths of Ly$\alpha$, LIS lines, and dust extinction are redshift-independent, as is the decoupling of Ly$\alpha$ and HIS line strengths, and the bulk outflow kinematics as traced by LIS lines. Stronger Ly$\alpha$ emission is observed at higher redshift at fixed UV luminosity, stellar mass, SFR, and age. Much of this variation in average Ly$\alpha$ strength with redshift, and the variation in Ly$\alpha$ strength at fixed redshift, can be explained in terms of variations in neutral gas covering fraction and/or dust content in the ISM and CGM. However, based on the connection between Ly$\alpha$ and CIII] emission strengths, we additionally find evidence for variations in the intrinsic production rate of Ly$\alpha$ photons at the highest Ly$\alpha$ EWs. The challenge now is to understand the observed evolution in neutral gas covering fraction and dust extinction within a coherent model for galaxy formation, and make robust predictions for the escape of ionizing radiation at z $\gt$ 6.},

We find that BGGs constitute two distinct populations of quiescent and star-forming galaxies and their mean SFR is $\sim2$ dex higher than the median SFR at $ z\lt1.3 $. Both the mean and the median SFRs decline with time by $\gt2$ dex. The mean (median) of stellar mass of BGGs has grown by $0.3$ dex since $z=1.3$ to the present day. We show that up to $\sim45\\% $ of the stellar mass growth in a star-forming BGG can be due to its star-formation activity. With respect to $f^{BGG}\_{b,200}$, we find it to increase with decreasing redshift by $\sim0.35$ dex while decreasing with halo mass in a redshift dependent manner. We show that the slope of the relation between $f^{BGG}\_{b,200}$ and halo mass increases negatively with decreasing redshift. This trend is driven by an insufficient star-formation in BGGs, compared to the halo growth rate. We separately show the BGGs with the 20$\backslash$\% highest $f^{BGG}\_{b,200}$ are generally non-star-forming galaxies and grow in mass by processes not related to star formation (e.g., dry mergers and tidal striping). We present the $ M\_\star-M\_h $ and $ M\_\star/M\_h-M\_h $ relations and compare them with semi-analytic model predictions and a number of results from the literature. We quantify the intrinsic scatter in stellar mass of BGGs at fixed halo mass ($\sigma\_{log M\_{\star}}$) and find that $\sigma\_{log M\_{\star}}$ increases from 0.3 dex at $ z\sim0.2 $ to 0.5 dex at $ z\sim1.0 $ due to the bimodal distribution of stellar mass.},

  abstract = {Although giant clumps of stars are thought to be crucial to galaxy formation and evolution, the most basic demographics of clumps are still uncertain, mainly because the definition of clumps has not been thoroughly discussed. In this paper, we carry out a study of the basic demographics of clumps in star-forming galaxies at 0.5 < z < 3, using our proposed physical definition that UV-bright clumps are discrete star-forming regions that individually contribute more than 8% of the rest-frame UV light of their galaxies. Clumps defined this way are significantly brighter than theH II regions of nearby large spiral galaxies, either individually or blended, when physical spatial resolution and cosmological dimming are considered. Under this definition, we measure the fraction of star-forming galaxies that have at least one off-center clump ( f clumpy ) and the contributions of clumps to the rest-frame UV light and star formation rate (SFR) of star-forming galaxies in the CANDELS/GOODS-S and UDS fields, where our mass-complete sample consists of 3239 galaxies with axial ratio q > 0.5. The redshift evolution of f clumpy changes with the stellar mass ( M * ) of the galaxies. Low-mass (log ( M * / M ☉ ) < 9.8) galaxies keep an almost constant f clumpy of ~60% from z ~ 3 to z ~ 0.5. Intermediate-mass and massive galaxies drop their f clumpy from 55% at z ~ 3 to 40% and 15%, respectively, at z ~ 0.5. We find that (1) the trend of disk stabilization predicted by violent disk instability matches the f clumpy trend of massive galaxies; (2) minor mergers are a viable explanation of the f clumpy trend of intermediate-mass galaxies at z < 1.5, given a realistic observability timescale; and (3) major mergers are unlikely responsible for the f clumpy trend in all masses at z < 1.5. The clump contribution to the rest-frame UV light of star-forming galaxies shows a broad peak around galaxies with log ( M * / M ☉ ) ~ 10.5 at all redshifts. The clump contribution in the intermediate-mass and massive galaxies is possibly linked to the molecular gas fraction of the galaxies. The clump contribution to the SFR of star-forming galaxies, generally around 4%-10%, also shows dependence on the galaxy M * , but for a given galaxy M * , its dependence on the redshift is mild.},

  abstract      = {In the local Universe, the existence of very young galaxies (VYGs), having formed at least half their stellar mass in the last 1 Gyr, is debated. We predict the present-day fraction of VYGs among central galaxies as a function of galaxy stellar mass. For this, we apply to high mass resolution Monte-Carlo halo merger trees (MCHMTs) three (one) analytical models of galaxy formation, where the ratio of stellar to halo mass (mass growth rate) is a function of halo mass and redshift. Galaxy merging is delayed until orbital decay by dynamical friction. With starbursts associated with halo mergers, our models predict typically one percent of VYGs up to galaxy masses of $10^{10}$ M$\_\odot$, falling rapidly at higher masses, and VYGs are usually associated with recent major mergers of their haloes. Without these starbursts, two of the models have VYG fractions reduced by 1 or 2 dex at low or intermediate stellar masses, and VYGs are rarely associated with major halo mergers. In comparison, the state-of-the-art semi-analytical model (SAM) of Henriques et al. produces only 0.01\% of VYGs at intermediate masses. Finally, the Menci et al. SAM run on MCMHTs with Warm Dark Matter cosmology generates 10 times more VYGs at masses below $10^8$ M$\_\odot$ than when run with Cold Dark Matter. The wide range in these VYG fractions illustrates the usefulness of VYGs to constrain both galaxy formation and cosmological models.},

The redshift distribution of these SPIRE sources from the Herschel Multitiered Extragalactic Survey peaks at z = 0.85, with 731 sources at z < 2 and a tail of sources out to z ~ 5. We measure more significant disagreement between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lang.gif] {lang} Δ z /(1 + z spec ) ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rang.gif] {rang} = 0.29) than is seen in non-infrared selected samples, likely due to enhanced star formation rates and dust obscuration in infrared-selected galaxies. The infrared data are used to directly measure integrated infrared luminosities and dust temperatures independent of radio or 24 μm flux densities. By probing the dust spectral energy distribution (SED) at its peak, we estimate that the vast majority (72%-83%) of z < 2 Herschel -selected galaxies would drop out of traditional submillimeter surveys at 0.85-1 mm. We find that dust temperature traces infrared luminosity, due in part to the SPIRE wavelength selection biases, and partially from physical effects. As a result, we measure no significant trend in SPIRE color with redshift; if dust temperature were independent of luminosity or redshift, a trend in SPIRE color would be expected. Composite infrared SEDs are constructed as a function of infrared luminosity, showing the increase in dust temperature with luminosity, and subtle change in near-infrared and mid-infrared spectral properties. Moderate evolution in the far-infrared (FIR)/radio correlation is measured for this partially radio-selected sample, with q IR ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} (1 + z ) –0.30 ± 0.02 at z < 2.

The sample is selected from the deepest public K -band imaging currently available. We show that the rest-frame U - V versus V - J color-color diagram is a powerful diagnostic of the stellar populations of distant galaxies. Galaxies with red rest-frame U - V colors are generally red in rest-frame V - J as well. However, at a given U - V color a range in V - J colors exists, and we show that this allows us to distinguish young, dusty galaxies from old, passively evolving galaxies. We quantify the effects of IRAC photometry on estimates of masses, ages, and the dust content of z > 2 galaxies. The estimated distributions of these properties do not change significantly when IRAC data are added to the UBVIJHK photometry. However, for individual galaxies the addition of IRAC can improve the constraints on the stellar populations, especially for red galaxies: uncertainties in stellar mass decrease by a factor of 2.7 for red [( U − V ) rest > 1] galaxies, but only by a factor of 1.3 for blue [( U − V ) rest < 1] galaxies. We find a similar color dependence of the improvement for estimates of age and dust extinction. In addition, the improvement from adding IRAC depends on the availability of full NIR JHK coverage; if only K band were available, the mass uncertainties of blue galaxies would decrease by a more substantial factor of 1.9. Finally, we find that a trend of galaxy color with stellar mass is already present at z > 2. The most massive galaxies at high redshift have red rest-frame U - V colors compared to lower mass galaxies, even when allowing for complex star formation histories.},

The lens is one of the two brightest cluster galaxies and lenses a background source galaxy into an arc and a counterimage. With Hubble Space Telescope (HST) grism and Keck/LRIS spectroscopy, we measure the source redshift to be $z\_{\rm S}=2.26$. Using HST imaging in ACS/F475W, ACS/F814W, WFC3/F125W, and WFC3/F160W, we model the lens mass distribution with an elliptical power-law profile and account for the effects of the cluster halo and nearby galaxies. The Einstein radius is $\theta\_{\rm E}=0.38^{+0.02}\_{-0.01}$`` ($3.2\_{-0.1}^{+0.2}$ kpc) and the total enclosed mass is M$\_{\rm tot} (\lt \theta\_{\rm E})=1.8^{+0.2}\_{-0.1}\times10^{11}~{\rm M}\_{\odot}$. We estimate that the cluster environment contributes $\sim10$\% of this total mass. Assuming a Chabrier IMF, the dark matter fraction within $\theta\_{{\rm E}}$ is $f\_{\rm DM}^{{\rm Chab}} = 0.3\_{-0.3}^{+0.1}$, while a Salpeter IMF is marginally inconsistent with the enclosed mass ($f\_{\rm DM}^{{\rm Salp}} = -0.3\_{-0.5}^{+0.2}$). The total magnification of the source is $\mu\_{\rm tot}=2.1\_{-0.3}^{+0.4}$. The source has at least one bright compact region offset from the source center. Emission from Ly$\alpha$ and [O III] are likely to probe different regions in the source.},

This study continues the series of spectral observations of tidal debris in the interacting galaxies. Here we pay special attention to the star-forming region between the interacting galaxies - a tidal dwarf galaxy (TDG) candidate. This star-forming system appears to be gravitationally bound or close to this condition. We show that TDG is metal poor in comparison to the parental galaxy. It can indicate that either the origin of star-forming gas of TDG was very far from the centre of parent galaxy or its gas has been diluted by the accretion of metal poor intergalactic gas. Nevertheless the region of the brightest emission clump in TDG where a current star formation takes place reveals a noticeable colour excess evidencing a local gas concentration. We pay attention that TDG is situated in the region of intersection of two gas flows and is in a process of formation probably caused by the collision of these flows. Low velocity difference between TDG, NGC 4017 and the gaseous bridge between them evidences that the lifetime of TDG is restricted by the time of its fall back onto the parent galaxy.},

We measured the flux and the equivalent width for the 11.3 micron PAH feature and the [SIV] line emission as a function of galactocentric distance. This allowed to study the star formation (SF) at sub-kpc scales from the nucleus for a large sample of nearby AGN. The [SIV] line emission could be tracing the AGN radiation field within a few thousand times the sublimation radius (R_sub), but it often peaks at distances greater than 1000 R_sub. One possibility is that the SF is contributing to the [SIV] total flux. We found an 11.3 micron PAH emission deficit within the inner few tens of parsecs from the AGN. This deficit might be due to the destruction of the molecules responsible for this feature or the lack of SF at these distances. We found a sensible agreement in the expected shift of the relation of the AGN bolometric luminosity and the SF rate. This indicates that numerical models attributing the link between AGN activity and host galaxy growth to mergers are in agreement with our data, for most inner galaxy parts.},

We use HST grism redshifts and extensive photometry in all five 3D- HST /CANDELS fields, more than doubling the area used previously for such studies, and combine these data with Keck MOSFIRE and NIRSPEC spectroscopy. We first confirm that a population of massive, compact, star-forming galaxies exists at z ≳ 2, using K -band spectroscopy of 25 of these objects at 2.0 < z < 2.5. They have a median [N ii ]/H α ratio of 0.6, are highly obscured with SFR(tot)/SFR(H α ) ∼10, and have a large range of observed line widths. We infer from the kinematics and spatial distribution of H α that the galaxies have rotating disks of ionized gas that are a factor of ∼2 more extended than the stellar distribution. By combining measurements of individual galaxies, we find that the kinematics are consistent with a nearly Keplerian fall-off from V rot ∼ 500 km s −1 at 1 kpc to V rot ∼ 250 km s −1 at 7 kpc, and that the total mass out to this radius is dominated by the dense stellar component. Next, we study the size and mass evolution of the progenitors of compact massive galaxies. Even though individual galaxies may have had complex histories with periods of compaction and mergers, we show that the population of progenitors likely followed a simple inside-out growth track in the size–mass plane of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/813/1/23/apj520554ieqn1.gif] {${\rm{\Delta }}\mathrm{log}{r}_{{\rm{e}}}\sim 0.3{\rm{\Delta }}\mathrm{log}{M}_{{\rm{stars}}}.$} This mode of growth gradually increases the stellar mass within a fixed physical radius, and galaxies quench when they reach a stellar density or velocity dispersion threshold.

The high spatial resolution (FWHM ∼ 0.″12–0.″18) ALMA and Hubble Space Telescope photometry are combined to construct deconvolved, mean radial profiles of their stellar mass and (UV+IR) SFR. We find that the dusty, nuclear IR–SFR overwhelmingly dominates the bolometric SFR up to r ∼ 5 kpc, by a factor of over 100× from the unobscured UV–SFR. Furthermore, the effective radius of the mean SFR profile ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/827/2/L32/apjlaa31adieqn3.gif] {${r}_{{\rm{e,SFR}}}\sim 1$} kpc) is ∼30% smaller than that of the stellar mass profile. The implied structural evolution, if such nuclear starburst last for the estimated gas depletion time of Δ t = ±100 Myr, is a 4× increase of the stellar mass density within the central 1 kpc and a 1.6× decrease of the half-mass–radius. This structural evolution fully supports dissipation-driven, formation scenarios in which strong nuclear starbursts transform larger, star-forming progenitors into compact quiescent galaxies.},

  abstract      = {The mechanisms responsible for the remarkably small sizes of the most massive quiescent galaxies at z\~{}2 are poorly understood. Partly because the nature of their progenitors is still unknown. Barro+13,14 used the deepest HST WFC3/F160W data to identify, for the first time, a population of massive compact star-forming galaxies (cSFGs) at 2 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3, whose small sizes, stellar structures and number densities strongly suggest that they are the immediate progenitors of such population.These cSFGs have spheroidal morphologies and centrally-concentrated mass profiles very similar to those of quiescent galaxies. Yet, they still are strongly star-forming and heavily dust obscured, as evidenced by their H-alpha emission and far-IR (Spitzer/Herschel) colors. This strongly suggests that cSFGs are rapidly growing a dense stellar core, as those observed in quenched galaxies. Quite remarkably, this is confirmed by their gas dynamics. Barro+14b revealed that cSFGs at z\~{}2 have high gas velocity dispersions of \~{}250 km/s, consistent with the stellar kinematics of equally massive quiescent galaxies, and indicative of their large dynamical masses.},

  abstract      = {Recent studies have shown that massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift are much more compact than present-day galaxies of the same mass. Here we compare the radial stellar density profiles and the number density of a sample of massive galaxies at z ~ 2.3 to nearby massive elliptical galaxies. We confirm that the average stellar densities of the z ~ 2.3 galaxies within the effective radius, ρ(< r e ), are two orders of magnitude higher than those of local elliptical galaxies of the same stellar mass. However, we also find that the densities measured within a constant physical radius of 1 kpc, ρ(<1 kpc), are higher by a factor of 2-3 only. This suggests that inside-out growth scenarios are plausible, in which the compact high-redshift galaxies make up the centers of normal nearby ellipticals. The compact galaxies are common at high redshift, which enables us to further constrain their evolution by requiring that the number density of their descendants does not exceed constraints imposed by the z = 0 galaxy mass function. We infer that size growth must be efficient, with ( r 1+2 / r 1 ) ~ ( M 1+2 / M 1 ) 2 . A simple model where compact galaxies with masses ~10 11 M ☉ primarily grow through minor mergers produces descendants with the approximate sizes, stellar densities, and number density of elliptical galaxies with masses 2-3 × 10 11 M ☉ in the local universe. We note that this model also predicts evolution in the M BH – σ relation, such that the progenitors of elliptical galaxies have lower black hole masses at fixed velocity dispersion. The main observational uncertainty is the conversion from light to mass; measurements of kinematics are needed to calibrate the masses and stellar densities of the high-redshift galaxies.},

Around 80% of galaxies in our GDDS sample have spectra dominated by stars with ages ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 1 Gyr. Our rest-frame R -band images show that most of these objects have compact regular morphologies which follow the classical R 1/4 law.

Around one-third (3/10) of the massive red objects in the GDDS sample are extraordinarily compact, with effective radii under 1 kpc. Our NICMOS observations allow the detection of such systems more robustly than is possible with optical (rest-frame UV) data, and while similar systems have been seen at z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 2, this is the first time such systems have been detected in a rest-frame optical survey at 1.2 < z < 2. We refer to these compact galaxies as "red nuggets," and note that similarly compact massive galaxies are completely absent in the nearby universe. We introduce a new "stellar mass Kormendy relation" (stellar mass density versus size) which we use to single out the effects of size evolution from those of luminosity and color evolution in stellar populations. The 1 < z < 2 passive galaxies have mass densities that are an order of magnitude larger then early-type galaxies today and are comparable to the compact distant red galaxies at 2 < z < 3. We briefly consider mechanisms for size evolution in contemporary models focusing on equal-mass mergers and adiabatic expansion driven by stellar mass loss. Neither of these mechanisms appears to be able to transform the high-redshift Kormendy relation into its local counterpart, leaving the origin and fate of these compact "red nuggets" unresolved.},

Our findings demonstrate that fully assembled early-type galaxies make up at most ~10% of the population of K -selected quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2.3, effectively ruling out simple monolithic models for their formation. The galaxies must evolve significantly after z ~ 2.3, through dry mergers or other processes, consistent with predictions from hierarchical models.},

  abstract      = {We investigate the roles of two classes of quenching mechanisms for central and satellite galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (z $\lt$ 0.075): those involving the halo and those involving the formation of a compact centre. For central galaxies with inner compactness {$\Sigma$}$_{1 kpc}$ {\tilde} 10$^{9-9.4}$ M$_{⊙}$ kpc$^{-2}$, the quenched fraction f$_{q}$ is strongly correlated with {$\Sigma$}$_{1 kpc}$ with only weak halo mass M$_{h}$ dependence. However, at higher and lower {$\Sigma$}$_{1 kpc}$, specific star formation rate (sSFR) is a strong function of M$_{h}$ and mostly independent of {$\Sigma$}$_{1 kpc}$. In other words, {$\Sigma$}$_{1 kpc}$ {\tilde} 10$^{9-9.4}$ M$_{⊙}$ kpc$^{-2}$ divides galaxies into those with high sSFR below and low sSFR above this range. In both the upper and lower regimes, increasing M$_{h}$ shifts the entire sSFR distribution to lower sSFR without a qualitative change in shape. This is true even at fixed M$_{*}$, but varying M$_{*}$ at fixed M$_{h}$ adds no quenching information. Most of the quenched centrals with M$_{h}$ $\gt$ 10$^{11.8}$ M$_{⊙}$ are dense ({$\Sigma$}$_{1 kpc}$ $\gt$ 10$^{9}$ M$_{⊙}$ kpc$^{-2}$), suggesting compaction-related quenching maintained by halo-related quenching. However, 21 per cent are diffuse, indicating only halo quenching. For satellite galaxies in the outskirts of haloes, quenching is a strong function of compactness and a weak function of host M$_{h}$. In the inner halo, M$_{h}$ dominates quenching, with {\tilde}90 per cent of the satellites being quenched once M$_{h}$ $\gt$ 10$^{13}$ M$_{⊙}$. This regional effect is greatest for the least massive satellites. As demonstrated via semi-analytic modelling with simple prescriptions for quenching, the observed correlations can be explained if quenching due to central compactness is rapid while quenching due to halo mass is slow.},

  abstract      = {We use cosmological simulations to study a characteristic evolution pattern of high-redshift galaxies. Early, stream-fed, highly perturbed, gas-rich discs undergo phases of dissipative contraction into compact, star-forming systems (`blue' nuggets) at z {\tilde} 4-2. The peak of gas compaction marks the onset of central gas depletion and inside-out quenching into compact ellipticals (red nuggets) by z {\tilde} 2. These are sometimes surrounded by gas rings or grow extended dry stellar envelopes. The compaction occurs at a roughly constant specific star formation rate (SFR), and the quenching occurs at a constant stellar surface density within the inner kpc ({$\Sigma$}$_{1}$). Massive galaxies quench earlier, faster, and at a higher {$\Sigma$}$_{1}$ than lower mass galaxies, which compactify and attempt to quench more than once. This evolution pattern is consistent with the way galaxies populate the SFR-size-mass space, and with gradients and scatter across the main sequence. The compaction is triggered by an intense inflow episode, involving (mostly minor) mergers, counter-rotating streams or recycled gas, and is commonly associated with violent disc instability. The contraction is dissipative, with the inflow rate $\gt$SFR, and the maximum {$\Sigma$}$_{1}$ anticorrelated with the initial spin parameter. The central quenching is triggered by the high SFR and stellar/supernova feedback (maybe also active galactic nucleus feedback) due to the high central gas density, while the central inflow weakens as the disc vanishes. Suppression of fresh gas supply by a hot halo allows the long-term maintenance of quenching once above a threshold halo mass, inducing the quenching downsizing.},

The median ratio of the effective radius in rest-frame V -band light to that in mass surface density is ~2 during the quiescent remnant phase. This is typically expressed by a negative color gradient (i.e., red core), which we expect to correlate with the integrated color of the system. Finally, the simulations differ from the observations in their surface brightness profile shape. The simulated remnants are typically best fit by high ( n ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/Gt.gif] {Gt} 4) Sérsic indices, whereas observed quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2 tend to be less cuspy ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lang.gif] {lang} n ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rang.gif] {rang} ~ 2.3).

We find that at 1 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3 the passively evolving ETGs are the reddest and most massive objects in the universe, and we prove that a correlation between mass, morphology, color, and star formation activity is already in place at that epoch. We measure a significant evolution in the mass-size relation of passive ETGs from z \~{} 3 to z \~{} 1, with galaxies growing on average by a factor of two in size in a 3 Gyr timescale only. We also witness an increase in the number density of passive ETGs of 50 times over the same time interval. We find that the first ETGs to form at z $\gt$\~{} 2 are all compact or ultra-compact, while normal-sized ETGs (meaning ETGs with sizes comparable to those of local counterparts of the same mass) are the most common ETGs only at z $\lt$ 1.

To investigate this claim, we have compared the ellipticity distribution of 31 carefully selected high-redshift massive quiescent compact galaxies to a set of mass-selected ellipticity and Sérsic index distributions obtained from two-dimensional structural fits to ~40, 000 nearby galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test shows that the distribution of ellipticities for the high-redshift galaxies is consistent with the ellipticity distribution of a similarly chosen sample of massive early-type galaxies. However, the distribution of Sérsic indices for the high-redshift sample is inconsistent with that of local early-type galaxies, and instead resembles that of local disk-dominated populations. The mismatch between the properties of high-redshift compact galaxies and those of both local early-type and disk-dominated systems leads us to conclude that the basic structures of high-redshift compact galaxies probably do not closely resemble those of any single local galaxy population. Any galaxy population analog to the high-redshift compact galaxies that exists at the current epoch is either a mix of different types of galaxies, or possibly a unique class of objects on their own.},

For z\~{}2 galaxies with moderate luminosities (L$_{8μm}$$\lt$10$^{11}$ L$_{solar}$), we find that the SFR can be estimated consistently from the multiwavelength data based on local luminosity correlations. However, 20\%-30\% of massive galaxies, and nearly all those with L$_{8μm}$$\gt$10$^{11}$ L$_{solar}$, show a mid-IR excess that is likely due to the presence of obscured active nuclei, as shown in a companion paper. There is a tight and roughly linear correlation between stellar mass and SFR for 24 {$\mu$}m-detected galaxies. For a given mass, the SFR at z=2 was larger by a factor of \~{}4 and \~{}30 relative to that in star-forming galaxies at z=1 and 0, respectively. Typical ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z=2 are relatively ``transparent'' to ultraviolet light, and their activity is long lived ($\gt$\~{}400 Myr), unlike that in local ULIRGs and high-redshift submillimeter-selected galaxies. ULIRGs are the common mode of star formation in massive galaxies at z=2, and the high duty cycle suggests that major mergers are not the dominant trigger for this activity. Current galaxy formation models underpredict the normalization of the mass-SFR correlation by about a factor of 4 and the space density of ULIRGs by an order of magnitude but give better agreement for z$\gt$1.4 quiescent galaxies.},

  abstract      = {We present a simple theoretical framework for massive galaxies at high redshift, where the main assembly and star formation occurred, and report on the first cosmological simulations that reveal clumpy disks consistent with our analysis. The evolution is governed by the interplay between smooth and clumpy cold streams, disk instability, and bulge formation. Intense, relatively smooth streams maintain an unstable dense gas-rich disk. Instability with high turbulence and giant clumps, each a few percent of the disk mass, is self-regulated by gravitational interactions within the disk. The clumps migrate into a bulge in ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 10 dynamical times, or ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 0.5 Gyr. The cosmological streams replenish the draining disk and prolong the clumpy phase to several Gigayears in a steady state , with comparable masses in disk, bulge, and dark matter within the disk radius. The clumps form stars in dense subclumps following the overall accretion rate, ~100 M ☉ yr –1 , and each clump converts into stars in ~0.5 Gyr. While the clumps coalesce dissipatively to a compact bulge, the star-forming disk is extended because the incoming streams keep the outer disk dense and susceptible to instability and because of angular momentum transport. Passive spheroid-dominated galaxies form when the streams are more clumpy: the external clumps merge into a massive bulge and stir up disk turbulence that stabilize the disk and suppress in situ clump and star formation. We predict a bimodality in galaxy type by z ~ 3, involving giant-clump star-forming disks and spheroid-dominated galaxies of suppressed star formation. After z ~ 1, the disks tend to be stabilized by the dominant stellar disks and bulges. Most of the high- z massive disks are likely to end up as today's early-type galaxies.},

We show that the stellar mass of galaxies at this number density has increased by a factor of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 2 since z = 2, following the relation log M n ( z ) = 11.45 – 0.15 z . In order to determine at what physical radii this mass growth occurred, we construct very deep stacked rest-frame R -band images of galaxies with masses near M n ( z ), at redshifts ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lang.gif] {lang} z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rang.gif] {rang} = 0.6, 1.1, 1.6, and 2.0. These image stacks of typically 70-80 galaxies enable us to characterize the stellar distribution to surface brightness limits of ~28.5 mag arcsec –2 . We find that massive galaxies gradually built up their outer regions over the past 10 Gyr. The mass within a radius of r = 5 kpc is nearly constant with redshift, whereas the mass at 5 kpc < r < 75 kpc has increased by a factor of ~4 since z = 2. Parameterizing the surface brightness profiles, we find that the effective radius and Sersic n parameter evolve as r e ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} (1 + z ) –1.3 and n ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} (1 + z ) –1.0 , respectively. The data demonstrate that massive galaxies have grown mostly inside-out, assembling their extended stellar halos around compact, dense cores with possibly exponential radial density distributions. Comparing the observed mass evolution to the average star formation rates of the galaxies we find that the growth is likely dominated by mergers, as in situ star formation can only account for ~20% of the mass buildup from z = 2 to z = 0. A direct consequence of these results is that massive galaxies do not evolve in a self-similar way: their structural profiles change as a function of redshift, complicating analyses which (often implicitly) assume self-similarity. The main uncertainties in this study are possible redshift-dependent systematic errors in the total stellar masses and the conversion from light-weighted to mass-weighted radial profiles.},

  abstract      = {We applied a criterion of gravitational instability, valid for two-component and infinitesimally thin discs, to observational data along the major axis for 7 spiral galaxies of early types. Unlike most papers, the dispersion equation corresponding to the criterion was solved directly without using any approximation. The velocity dispersion of stars in the radial direction $\sigma\_R$ was limited by the range of possible values instead of a fixed value. For all galaxies, the outer regions of the disc were analyzed up to $R \lt 130^{"}$. The maximal and sub-maximal disc models were used to translate surface brightness into surface density. The largest destabilizing disturbance stars can exert on a gaseous disc was estimated. It was shown that the two-component criterion differs a little from the one-fluid criterion for galaxies with a large surface gas density, but it allows to explain large-scale star formation in those regions where the gaseous disc is stable. In the galaxy NGC 1167 star formation is entirely driven by the self-gravity of the stars. A comparison is made with the conventional approximations which also include the thickness effect and with models for different sound speed $c\_\mathrm{g}$. It is shown that values of the effective Toomre parameter correspond to the instability criterion of a two-component disc $Q\_\mathrm{eff}\lt1.5-2.5$. This result is consistent with previous theoretical and observational studies.},

We compare high spectral (~0.82 km/s/channel) and spatial resolution (physical resolutions of 170 pc - 700 pc) HI imaging from the VLA with H\alpha and far-ultraviolet imaging. We quantify the degree of co-spatiality between star forming regions and regions of high HI column densities. We calculate the global star formation efficiencies (SFE, $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ / $\Sigma_{\rm HI}$), and examine the relationships among the SFE and HI mass, HI column density, and star formation rate (SFR). The systems are consuming their cold neutral gas on timescales of order a few Gyr. While we derive an index for the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation of N ~ 0.68 $\pm$ 0.04 for the SHIELD sample as a whole, the values of N vary considerably from system to system. By supplementing SHIELD results with those from other surveys, we find that HI mass and UV-based SFR are strongly correlated over five orders of magnitude. Identification of patterns within the SHIELD sample allows us to bin the galaxies into three general categories: 1) mainly co-spatial HI and SF regions, found in systems with highest peak HI column densities and highest total HI masses, 2) moderately correlated HI and SF regions, found in systems with moderate HI column densities, and 3) obvious offsets between HI and SF peaks, found in systems with the lowest total HI masses. SF in these galaxies is dominated by stochasticity and random fluctuations in their ISM.},

Our sample includes 36 objects with rotation curves carefully selected from the literature. We find that, despite the large variations of our sample in luminosities ($\sim$ 2 of dex), the rotation curves in specifically normalized units, look all alike and lead to the lower-mass version of the universal rotation curve of spiral galaxies found in Persic et al. We mass model the double normalized universal rotation curve $V(R/R_{opt})/V_{opt}$ of dwarf disc galaxies: the results show that these systems are totally dominated by dark matter whose density shows a core size between 2 and 3 stellar disc scale lengths. Similar to galaxies of different Hubble types and luminosities, the core radius $r_0$ and the central density $\rho_0$ of the dark matter halo of these objects are related by $ \rho_0 r_0 \sim 100\hspace{0.1cm} \mathrm{M_\odot pc^{-2}}$. The structural properties of the dark and luminous matter emerge very well correlated. In addition, to describe these relations, we need to introduce a new parameter, measuring the compactness of light distribution of a (dwarf) disc galaxy. These structural properties also indicate that there is no evidence of abrupt decline at the faint end of the baryonic to halo mass relation. Finally, we find that the distributions of the stellar disc and its dark matter halo are closely related.},

  abstract    = {The Galaxy Zoo 1 catalog displays a bias towards the S-wise winding direction in spiral galaxies which has yet to be explained. The lack of an explanation confounds our attempts to verify the Cosmological Principle, and has spurred some debate as to whether a bias exists in the real universe. The bias manifests not only in the obvious case of trying to decide if the universe as a whole has a winding bias, but also in the more insidious case of selecting which galaxies to include in a winding direction survey. While the former bias has been accounted for in a previous image-mirroring study, the latter has not. Furthermore, the bias has never been {\em corrected} in the GZ1 catalog, as only a small sample of the GZ1 catalog was re-examined during the mirror study. We show that the existing bias is a human {\em selection} effect rather than a human chirality bias. In effect, the excess S-wise votes are spuriously "stolen" from the elliptical and edge-on-disk categories, not the Z-wise category. Thus, when selecting a set of spiral galaxies by imposing a threshold $T$ so that $\max(P_S,P_Z) > T$ or $P_S+P_Z>T$, we spuriously select more S-wise than Z-wise galaxies. We show that when a provably unbiased machine selects which galaxies are spirals independent of their chirality, the S-wise surplus vanishes, even if humans are still used to determine the chirality. Thus, when viewed across the entire GZ1 sample (and by implication, the Sloan catalog), the winding direction of arms in spiral galaxies as viewed from Earth is consistent with the flip of a fair coin.},

This stacking scheme does not assume any dependence of metallicity on mass or star formation rate, but only that galaxies with the same line ratios have the same oxygen abundance. We provide calibrations which span more than 1 dex in metallicity and are entirely defined on a consistent absolute Te metallicity scale for galaxies.

Based on new measurements with integral field spectroscopy of a large representative galaxy sample, we find an appreciable fraction of counter-rotators among blue galaxies (9 out of 489 galaxies). The central regions of blue counter-rotators show younger stellar populations and more intense, ongoing star formation than their outer parts, indicating ongoing growth of the central regions. The result offers observational evidence that the acquisition of external gas in blue galaxies is possible; the interaction with pre-existing gas funnels the gas into nuclear regions (< 1 kpc) to form new stars.},

This phenomenon, called the blue nugget (BN) phase, is the compact star-forming phase in the central regions of many growing galaxies that follows an earlier phase of gas compaction and is followed by a central quenching phase. We train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with mock ``observed'' images of simulated galaxies at three phases of evolution: pre-BN, BN and post-BN, and demonstrate that the CNN successfully retrieves the three phases in other simulated galaxies. We show that BNs are identified by the CNN within a time window of $\sim0.15$ Hubble times. When the trained CNN is applied to observed galaxies from the CANDELS survey at $z=1-3$, it successfully identifies galaxies at the three phases. We find that the observed BNs are preferentially found in galaxies at a characteristic stellar mass range, $10^{9.2-10.3} M\_\odot$ at all redshifts. This is consistent with the characteristic galaxy mass for BNs as detected in the simulations, and is meaningful because it is revealed in the observations when the direct information concerning the total galaxy luminosity has been eliminated from the training set. This technique can be applied to the classification of other astrophysical phenomena for improved comparison of theory and observations in the era of large imaging surveys and cosmological simulations.},

  title       = {Investigating a population of infrared-bright gamma-ray burst host galaxies},
  abstract    = {We identify and explore the properties of an infrared-bright gamma-ray burst (GRB) host population. Candidate hosts are selected by coincidence with sources in WISE, with matching to random coordinates and a false alarm probability analysis showing that the contamination fraction is approx 0.5. This methodology has already identified the host galaxy of GRB 080517. We combine survey photometry from Pan-STARRS, SDSS, APASS, 2MASS, GALEX and WISE with our own WHT/ACAM and VLT/X- shooter observations to classify the candidates and identify interlopers. Galaxy SED fitting is performed using MAGPHYS, in addition to stellar template fitting, yielding 13 possible IR-bright hosts. A further 7 candidates are identified from previously published work. We report a candidate host for GRB 061002, previously unidentified as such. The remainder of the galaxies have already been noted as potential hosts. Comparing the IR-bright population properties including redshift z, stellar mass M*, star formation rate SFR and V-band attenuation Av to GRB host catalogues in the literature, we find that the infrared-bright population is biased toward low z, high M* and high Av. This naturally arises from their initial selection - local and dusty galaxies are more likely to have the required IR flux to be detected in WISE. We conclude that while IR-bright GRB hosts are not a physically distinct class, they are useful for constraining existing GRB host populations, particularly for long GRBs.},

  abstract    = {For the same stellar mass, physically smaller star-forming galaxies are also metal richer (Ellison et al. 2008). What causes the relation remains unclear. The central star-forming galaxies in the EAGLE cosmological numerical simulation reproduce the observed trend. We use them to explore the origin of the relation assuming that the physical mechanism responsible for the anti-correlation between size and gas-phase metallicity is the same in the simulated and the observed galaxies. We consider the three most likely causes: (1) metal-poor gas inflows feeding the star-formation process, (2) metal-rich gas outflows particularly efficient in shallow gravitational potentials, and (3) enhanced efficiency of the star-formation process in compact galaxies. Outflows (2) and enhanced star-formation efficiency (3) can be discarded. Metal-poor gas inflows (1) cause the correlation in the simulated galaxies. Galaxies grow in size with time, so those that receive gas later are both metal poorer and larger, giving rise to the observed anti-correlation. As expected within this explanation, larger galaxies have younger stellar populations. We explore the variation with redshift of the relation, which is maintained up to, at least, redshift 8.},

They are believed to form as a consequence of the energy that is dissipated by turbulence and shocks in the intra-cluster medium (ICM). However, the precise physical processes that generate these steep synchrotron spectrum sources are still poorly constrained. We present a new LOFAR observation of the double galaxy cluster Abell 1758. This system is composed of A1758N, a massive cluster hosting a known giant radio halo, and A1758S, which is a less massive cluster whose diffuse radio emission is confirmed here for the first time. Our observations have revealed a radio halo and a candidate radio relic in A1758S, and a suggestion of emission along the bridge connecting the two systems which deserves confirmation. We combined the LOFAR data with archival VLA and GMRT observations to constrain the spectral properties of the diffuse emission. We also analyzed a deep archival Chandra observation and used this to provide evidence that A1758N and A1758S are in a pre-merger phase. The ICM temperature across the bridge that connects the two systems shows a jump which might indicate the presence of a transversal shock generated in the initial stage of the merger.},

The pc-scale radio structure at 5 GHz are presented by using our VLBA observations for 21 sources in February, 2016, the analysis on the archival data for 16 objects, and directly taking the measurements for 8 radio galaxies available in literatures. The accretion mode is constrained from the Eddington ratio with a dividing value of 0.01, which is estimated from the MIR-based bolometric luminosity and the black hole masses. While most FRII radio galaxies have higher Eddington ratio than FRIs, we found that there is indeed no single correspondence between the FR morphology and accretion mode with eight FRIIs at low accretion and two FRIs at high accretion rate. There is a significant correlation between the VLBA core luminosity at 5 GHz and the Eddington ratio. Various morphologies are found in our sample, including core only, single-sided core-jet, and two-sided core-jet structures. We found that the higher accretion rate may be more likely related with the core-jet structure, thus more extended jet. These results imply that the higher accretion rates are likely able to produce more powerful jets. There is a strong correlation between the MIR luminosity at 15 $\mu$m and VLBA 5 GHz core luminosity, in favour of the tight relation between the accretion disk and jets. In our sample, the core brightness temperature ranges from $10^{9}$ to $10^{13.38}$ K with a median value of $10^{11.09}$ K indicating that systematically the beaming effect may not be significant....},

Out of an original 3.4 Mpc$^3$/h$^3$ cosmological box, a sample of 27 systems are zoomed-in from z=70 to z=0. Gas and stellar properties are confronted to the observations in the greatest details: in addition to the galaxy global properties, we investigate the model galaxy velocity dispersion profiles, half-light radii, star formation histories, metallicity distributions, and [Mg/Fe] abundance ratios. The formation and sustainability of the metallicity gradients and kinetically distinct stellar populations are also tackled. We show how the properties of six Local Group dwarf galaxies, NGC 6622, Andromeda II, Sculptor, Sextans, Ursa Minor and Draco are reproduced, and how they pertain to three main galaxy build-up modes. Our results indicate that the interaction with a massive central galaxy could be needed for a handful of Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies only, the vast majority of the systems and their variety of star formation histories arising naturally from a $\Lambda$CDM framework. We find that models fitting well the local Group dwarf galaxies are embedded in dark haloes of mass between $5\times 10^8$ to a few $10^9\,\rm{M_\odot}$, without any missing satellite problem. We confirm the failure of the abundance matching approach at the mass scale of dwarf galaxies. Some of the observed faint however gas-rich galaxies with residual star formation, such as Leo T and Leo P, remain challenging. They point out the need of a better understanding of the UV-background heating.},

We find that compact galaxies with radii and mass densities comparable to high-z massive and passive galaxies represent 4.4\% of all galaxies with stellar masses above 3 {\times} 10$^{10}$ M $_{⊙}$, yielding a number density of 4.3 {\times} 10$^{-4}$ h $^{3}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. Most of them are S0s (70\%) or ellipticals (23\%), are red, and have intermediate-to-old stellar populations, with a median luminosity-weighted age of 5.4 Gyr and a median mass-weighted age of 9.2 Gyr. Their velocity dispersions and dynamical masses are consistent with the small radii and high stellar mass estimates. Comparing with the WINGS sample of cluster galaxies at similar redshifts, the fraction of SDGs is three times smaller in the field than in clusters, and cluster SDGs are on average 4 Gyr older than field SDGs. We confirm the existence of a universal trend of smaller radii for older luminosity-weighted ages at fixed galaxy mass. As a consequence, the median mass-size relation shifts toward smaller radii for galaxies with older stars, but the effect is much more pronounced in clusters than in the field. Our results show that, on top of the well-known dependence of stellar age on galaxy mass, the luminosity-weighted age of galaxies depends on galaxy compactness at fixed mass and, for a fixed mass and radius, on environment. This effect needs to be taken into account in order not to overestimate the evolution of galaxy sizes from high to low z. Our results and hierarchical simulations suggest that a significant fraction of the massive compact galaxies at high z have evolved into compact galaxies in galaxy clusters today. When stellar age and environmental effects are taken into account, the average amount of size evolution of individual galaxies between high and low z is mild, a factor \~{}1.6.},

Of these, 56 are quiescent with high signal-to-noise absorption line spectra, enabling us to determine robust stellar velocity dispersions for the largest sample yet available beyond a redshift of 1. Together with effective radii measured from deep Hubble Space Telescope images, we calculate dynamical masses and address key questions relating to the puzzling size growth claimed by many observers for quiescent galaxies over the redshift interval 0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2. Our large sample provides the first opportunity to carefully examine the relationship between stellar and dynamical masses at high redshift. We find this relation closely follows that determined locally. We also confirm the utility of the locally established empirical calibration which enables high-redshift velocity dispersions to be estimated photometrically, and we determine its accuracy to be 35\%. To address recent suggestions that progenitor bias{\mdash}the continued arrival of recently quenched larger galaxies{\mdash}can largely explain the size evolution of quiescent galaxies, we examine the growth at fixed velocity dispersion assuming this quantity is largely unaffected by the merger history. Using the velocity dispersion-age relation observed in the local universe, we demonstrate that significant size and mass growth have clearly occurred in individual systems. Parameterizing the relation between mass and size growth over 0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1.6 as RvpropM $^{α}$, we find {$\alpha$} = 1.6 {\plusmn} 0.3, in agreement with theoretical expectations from simulations of minor mergers. Relaxing the assumption that the velocity dispersion is unchanging, we examine growth assuming a constant ranking in galaxy velocity dispersion. This approach is applicable only to the large-dispersion tail of the distribution, but yields a consistent growth rate of {$\alpha$} = 1.4 {\plusmn} 0.2. Both methods confirm that progenitor bias alone is insufficient to explain our new observations and that quiescent galaxies have grown in both size and stellar mass over 0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1.6.},

Using our new population synthesis model that accounts for the effect of variable abundance ratios of 11 elements, we analyze very high quality absorption line spectra of 38 early-type galaxies and the nuclear bulge of M31. These data extend to 1 {$\mu$}m and they therefore include the IMF-sensitive spectral features Na I, Ca II, and FeH at 0.82 {$\mu$}m, 0.86 {$\mu$}m, and 0.99 {$\mu$}m, respectively. The models fit the data well, with typical rms residuals $\lt$\~{} 1\%. Strong constraints on the IMF and therefore the stellar mass-to-light ratio, (M/L)$_{stars}$, are derived for individual galaxies. We find that the IMF becomes increasingly bottom-heavy with increasing velocity dispersion and [Mg/Fe]. At the lowest dispersions and [Mg/Fe] values the derived IMF is consistent with the Milky Way (MW) IMF, while at the highest dispersions and [Mg/Fe] values the derived IMF contains more low-mass stars (is more bottom-heavy) than even a Salpeter IMF. Our best-fit (M/L)$_{stars}$ values do not exceed dynamically based M/L values. We also apply our models to stacked spectra of four metal-rich globular clusters in M31 and find an (M/L)$_{stars}$ that implies fewer low-mass stars than a MW IMF, again agreeing with dynamical constraints. We discuss other possible explanations for the observed trends and conclude that variation in the IMF is the simplest and most plausible.},

We consider spheroid sizes, velocity dispersions, dynamical masses, profile shapes (S{\'e}rsic indices), stellar and supermassive black hole (BH) masses, and their related scalings. Our approach combines advantages of prior observational constraints in halo occupation models and libraries of high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy mergers. This allows us to separate the relative roles of dissipation, dry mergers, formation time, and evolution in progenitor properties, and identify their impact on observed scalings at each redshift. We show that, at all redshifts, dissipation is the most important factor determining spheroid sizes and fundamental plane scalings, and can account (at z = 0) for the observed fundamental plane tilt and differences between observed disk and spheroid scaling relations. Because disks (spheroid progenitors) at high redshift have characteristically larger gas fractions, this predicts more dissipation in mergers, yielding systematically more compact, smaller spheroids. In detail, this gives rise to a mass-dependent evolution in the sizes of spheroids of a given mass, which agrees well with observations. This relates to a subtle weakening of the tilt of the early-type fundamental plane with redshift, important for a number of studies that assume a nonevolving stellar mass fundamental plane. This also predicts evolution in the BH-host mass relations, toward more massive BHs at higher redshifts. Dry mergers are also significant, but only for large systems which form early{\mdash}they originate as compact systems, but undergo a number of dry mergers (consistent with observations) such that they have sizes at any later observed redshift similar to systems of the same mass formed more recently. Most of the observed, compact high-redshift ellipticals will become the cores of present brightest cluster galaxies, and we show how their sizes, velocity dispersions, and BH masses evolve to become consistent with observations. We also predict what fraction might survive intact from early formation and identify their characteristic z = 0 properties. We make predictions for residual correlations as well, e.g., the correlation of size and fundamental plane residuals with formation time of a given elliptical, that can be used as additional tests of these models.},

We present rest-frame UV spectra of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at z \~{} 3 selected to be candidate progenitors of the quenched galaxies at z \~{} 2 based on their compact rest-frame-optical sizes and high {$\Sigma$}$_{SFR}$. We compare their UV properties to those of more extended LBGs of similar mass and star-formation rate (non-candidates). We find that candidate progenitors have faster bulk interstellar medium (ISM) gas velocities and higher equivalent widths of interstellar absorption lines, implying larger velocity spread among absorbing clouds. Candidates deviate from the relationship between equivalent widths of Ly{$\alpha$} and interstellar absorption lines in that their Ly{$\alpha$} emission remains strong despite high interstellar absorption, possibly indicating that the neutral H I fraction is patchy, such that Ly{$\alpha$} photons can escape. We detect stronger C IV P-Cygni features (emission and absorption) and He II emission in candidates, indicative of larger populations of metal-rich Wolf-Rayet stars compared to non-candidates. The faster bulk motions, broader spread of gas velocity, and Ly{$\alpha$} properties of candidates are consistent with their ISM being subject to more energetic feedback than non-candidates. Together with their larger metallicity (implying more evolved star-formation activity) this leads us to propose, if speculatively, that they are likely to quench sooner than non-candidates, supporting the validity of selection criteria used to identify them as progenitors of z \~{} 2 passive galaxies. We propose that massive, compact galaxies undergo more rapid growth of their stellar mass content, perhaps because the gas accretion mechanisms are different, and quench sooner than normally sized LBGs at these (early) epochs.},

The spectrum exhibits a strong optical break and several absorption features, which have not previously been detected in z $\gt$ 2 quiescent galaxies. Comparison of the spectral energy distribution with stellar population synthesis models implies a low star formation rate (SFR) of 1-3 M $_{sun}$ yr$^{-1}$, an age of 1.3-2.2 Gyr, and a stellar mass of \~{}2 {\times} 10$^{11}$ M $_{sun}$. We detect several faint emission lines, with emission-line ratios of [N II]/H{$\alpha$}, [S II]/H{$\alpha$}, and [O II]/[O III] typical of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions. Thus, neither the stellar continuum nor the nebular emission implies active star formation. The current SFR is $\lt$1\% of the past average SFR. If this galaxy is representative of compact quiescent galaxies beyond z = 2, it implies that quenching of star formation is extremely efficient and also indicates that low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) could be common in these objects. Nuclear emission is a potential concern for the size measurement. However, we show that the AGN contributes lsim8\% to the rest-frame optical emission. A possible post-starburst population may affect size measurements more strongly; although a 0.5 Gyr old stellar population can make up lsim10\% of the total stellar mass, it could account for up to \~{}40\% of the optical light. Nevertheless, this spectrum shows that this compact galaxy is dominated by an evolved stellar population.},

  abstract      = {We present Hubble Space Telescope NIC2 morphologies of a spectroscopic sample of massive galaxies at z \~{} 2.3 by extending our sample of 9 compact quiescent galaxies (r$_{e}$ \~{} 0.9 kpc) with 10 massive emission-line galaxies. The emission-line galaxies are classified by the nature of their ionized emission; there are six star-forming galaxies and four galaxies hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The star-forming galaxies are the largest among the emission-line galaxies, with a median size of r$_{e}$ = 2.8 kpc. The three galaxies with the highest star formation rates (gsim100 M $_{sun}$ yr$^{-1}$) have irregular and clumpy morphologies. The AGN host galaxies are more similar to the compact quiescent galaxies in terms of their structures (r$_{e}$ \~{} 1.1 kpc) and spectral energy distributions. The total sample clearly separates into two classes in a color-mass diagram: the large star-forming galaxies that form the blue cloud, and the compact quiescent galaxies on the red sequence. However, it is unclear how or even if the two classes are evolutionary related. Three out of six massive star-forming galaxies have dense cores and thus may passively evolve into compact galaxies due to fading of outer star-forming regions. For these galaxies, a reverse scenario in which compact galaxies grow inside-out by star formation is also plausible. We do caution though that the sample is small. Nonetheless, it is evident that a Hubble sequence of massive galaxies with strongly correlated galaxy properties is already in place at z $\gt$ 2.

  abstract      = {We develop and test a model for the cosmological role of mergers in the formation and quenching of red, early-type galaxies. By combining theoretically well-constrained halo and subhalo mass functions as a function of redshift and environment with empirical halo occupation models, we predict the distribution of mergers as a function of redshift, environment, and physical galaxy properties. Making the simple Ansatz that star formation is quenched after a gas-rich, spheroid-forming major merger, we demonstrate that this naturally predicts the turnover in the efficiency of star formation and baryon fractions in galaxies at \~{}L$_{*}$ (without any parameters tuned to this value), as well as the observed mass functions and mass density of red galaxies as a function of redshift, the formation times of early-type galaxies as a function of mass, and the fraction of quenched galaxies as a function of galaxy and halo mass, environment, and redshift. Comparing our model to a variety of semianalytic models in which quenching is primarily driven by halo mass considerations or secular/disk instabilities, we demonstrate that our model makes unique and robust qualitative predictions for a number of observables, including the bivariate red fraction as a function of galaxy and halo mass, the density of passive galaxies at high redshifts, the emergence/evolution of the color-morphology-density relations at high redshift, and the fraction of disky/boxy (or cusp/core) spheroids as a function of mass. In each case, the observations favor a model in which some mechanism quenches future star formation after a major merger builds a massive spheroid. Models where quenching is dominated by a halo mass threshold fail to match the behavior of the bivariate red fractions, predict too low a density of passive galaxies at high redshift, and overpredict by an order of magnitude the mass of the transition from disky to boxy ellipticals. Models driven by secular disk instabilities also qualitatively disagree with the bivariate red fractions, fail to predict the observed evolution in the color-density relations, and predict order-of-magnitude incorrect distributions of kinematic types in early-type galaxies. We make specific predictions for how future observations, for example, quantifying the red fraction as a function of galaxy mass, halo mass, environment, or redshift, can break the degeneracies between a number of different assumptions adopted in present galaxy formation models. We discuss a variety of physical possibilities for this quenching and propose a mixed scenario in which traditional quenching in hot, quasi-static massive halos is supplemented by the strong shocks and feedback energy input associated with a major merger (e.g., tidal shocks, starburst-driven winds, and quasar feedback), which temporarily suppress cooling and establish the conditions of a dynamically hot halo in the central regions of the host, even in low-mass halos (below the traditional threshold for accretion shocks).},

  abstract      = {We revisit previous suggestions that the heating provided by the winds of dying low-mass stars plays an important role in preventing star formation in quiescent galaxies. At the end of their asymptotic giant branch phase, intermediate and low-mass stars eject their envelopes rapidly in a super-wind phase, usually giving rise to planetary nebulae. In spheroidal galaxies with high stellar velocity dispersions, the interaction of these ejected envelopes with the ambient diffuse gas can lead to significant, isotropic and steady-state heating that scales as $\backslash$dot$\{$M$\}$$_{*}${$\sigma$}$_{*}$$^{2}$. We show that cooling of the central regions of the hot diffuse halo gas can be delayed for a Hubble time for halos more massive than {\tilde} $\{$$\{$10$\}$$^{12.5}$$\}$ $\{$$\{$M$\}$$_{⊙ }$$\}$ at 0$\backslash$lt z$\backslash$lt 2, although stellar heating alone is unlikely to forestall cooling in the most massive clusters at z = 0. This mechanism provides a natural explanation for the strong trend of galaxy quiescence with stellar surface density and velocity dispersion. In addition, since the ejected material will thermalize to kT {\tilde}  {$\sigma$} $_{*}$$^{2}$, this mechanism provides an explanation for the observed similarity between the central temperature of the hot diffuse gas and {$\sigma$} $_{*}$$^{2}$, a result that is not trivial in light of the short inferred cooling times of the hot gas. The main uncertainty in this analysis is the ultimate fate of the stellar ejecta. Preventing accumulation of the ejecta in the central regions may require energy input from another source, such as Type Ia supernovae. Detailed simulations of the interaction of the stellar wind with the ambient gas are required to better quantify the net effect of AGB heating.},

  abstract      = {We study the thermal formation history of four simulated galaxies that were shown by Naab et al. to reproduce a number of observed properties of elliptical galaxies. The temperature of the gas in the galaxies is steadily increasing with decreasing redshift, although much of the gas has a cooling time shorter than the Hubble time. The gas is being heated and kept hot by gravitational heating processes through the release of potential energy from infalling stellar clumps. The energy is dissipated in supersonic collisions of infalling gas lumps with the ambient gas and through the dynamical capturing of satellite systems causing gravitational wakes that transfer energy to the surrounding gas. Furthermore, dynamical friction from the infalling clumps pushes out dark matter (DM), lowering the central DM density by up to a factor of 2 from z = 3 to z = 0. In galaxies in which the late formation history (z lsim 2) is dominated by minor merging and accretion, the energy released (E \~{} 5 {\times} 10$^{59}$ erg) from gravitational feedback is sufficient to form red and dead elliptical galaxies by z \~{} 1 even in the absence of supernova and AGN feedback.},

The structural parameters of the galaxies, derived from the associated WFC3 F140W imaging data, correlate with the presence of H{$\alpha$} quiescent galaxies are compact with high S{\'e}rsic index and high inferred velocity dispersion, whereas star-forming galaxies are typically large two-armed spiral galaxies, with low S{\'e}rsic index. Some of these star-forming galaxies might be progenitors of the most massive S0 and Sa galaxies. Our results challenge the idea that galaxies at fixed mass form a homogeneous population with small scatter in their properties. Instead, we find that massive galaxies form a highly diverse population at z $\gt$ 1, in marked contrast to the local universe.},

  abstract      = {We studied Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) escape in a statistical sample of 43 Green Peas with HST/COS Ly$\alpha$ spectra. Green Peas are nearby star-forming galaxies with strong [OIII]$\lambda$5007 emission lines. Our sample is four times larger than the previous sample and covers a much more complete range of Green Pea properties. We found that about 2/3 of Green Peas are strong Ly$\alpha$ line emitters with rest-frame Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width $\gt20$ $\backslash$AA. The Ly$\alpha$ profiles of Green Peas are diverse. The Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction, defined as the ratio of observed Ly$\alpha$ flux to intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ flux, shows anti-correlations with a few Ly$\alpha$ kinematic features -- both the blue peak and red peak velocities, the peak separations, and FWHM of the red portion of the Ly$\alpha$ profile. Using properties measured from SDSS optical spectra, we found many correlations -- Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction generally increases at lower dust reddening, lower metallicity, lower stellar mass, and higher [OIII]/[OII] ratio. We fit their Ly$\alpha$ profiles with the HI shell radiative transfer model and found Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction anti-correlates with the best-fit $N\_{HI}$. Finally, we fit an empirical linear relation to predict Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction from the dust extinction and Ly$\alpha$ red peak velocity. The standard deviation of this relation is about 0.3 dex. This relation can be used to isolate the effect of IGM scatterings from Ly$\alpha$ escape and to probe the IGM optical depth along the line of sight of each $z\gt7$ Ly$\alpha$ emission line galaxy in the JWST era.},

From stars to active galactic nuclei, many astrophysical systems are surrounded by an equatorial distribution of dusty material that are, in a number of cases, spatially unresolved even with cutting edge facilities. Aims. In this paper, we investigate if and how one can determine the unresolved and heterogeneous morphology of dust distribution around a central bright source using time-resolved polarimetric observations. Methods. We use polarized radiative transfer simulations to study a sample of circumnuclear dusty morphologies. We explore a grid of uniform, fragmented, density-stratified, geometrically-variable models in the near-infrared, optical and ultraviolet bands, and present their distinctive time-dependent polarimetric signatures. Results. As expected, varying the structure of the obscuring equatorial disk has a deep impact on the inclination-dependent flux, polarization degree and angle, and time-lags we observe. We find that stratified media are distinguishable by time-resolved polarimetric observations, and that the expected polarization is much higher in the infrared band than in the ultraviolet. However, due to the physical scales imposed by dust sublimation, the average time-lags between the total and polarized fluxes are important (months to years), lengthening the observational campaigns necessary to break more sophisticated (and therefore also more degenerated) models. In the ultraviolet band, time-lags are slightly shorter than in the infrared or optical bands, and, coupled to lower diluting starlight fluxes, time-resolved polarimetry in the UV appears more promising for future campaigns.},

The UV continuum of the lensed galaxy is very blue, which is seemingly at odds with its redder optical colors. The 3D-HST WFC3/G141 near-infrared spectrum of the lens reveals the source of this discrepancy to be extremely strong [O III] {$\lambda$}5007 and H{$\beta$} emission lines with rest-frame equivalent widths of 2000 {\plusmn} 100 and 520 {\plusmn} 40 {\AA}, respectively. The source has a stellar mass \~{}10$^{8}$ M $_{⊙}$, sSFR \~{} 100 Gyr$^{-1}$, and detection of [O III] {$\lambda$}4363 yields a metallicity of 12 + log (O/H) = 7.5 {\plusmn} 0.2. We identify local blue compact dwarf analogs to SL2SJ02176-0513, which are among the most metal-poor galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The local analogs resemble the lensed galaxy in many ways, including UV/optical spectral energy distribution, spatial morphology, and emission line equivalent widths and ratios. Common to SL2SJ02176-0513 and its local counterparts is an upturn at mid-IR wavelengths likely arising from hot dust heated by starbursts. The emission lines of SL2SJ02176-0513 are spatially resolved owing to the combination of the lens and the high spatial resolution of HST. The lensed galaxy is composed of two clumps with combined size r$_{e}$ \~{}300 pc, and we resolve significant differences in UV color and emission line equivalent width between them. Though it has characteristics occasionally attributed to active galactic nuclei, we conclude that SL2SJ02176-0513 is a low-metallicity star-bursting dwarf galaxy.

Two similarly bright sources are also detected in a reanalysis of the GOODS-S data set. Three of the four galaxies in GOODS-N are significantly detected at 4.5{$\sigma$}-6.2{$\sigma$} in the very deep Spitzer/IRAC 4.5 {$\mu$}m data, as is one of the GOODS-S candidates. Furthermore, the brightest of our candidates (at z = 10.2 {\plusmn} 0.4) is robustly detected also at 3.6 {$\mu$}m (6.9{$\sigma$}), revealing a flat UV spectral energy distribution with a slope {$\beta$} = -2.0 {\plusmn} 0.2, consistent with demonstrated trends with luminosity at high redshift. Thorough testing and use of grism data excludes known low-redshift contamination at high significance, including single emission-line sources, but as-yet unknown low redshift sources could provide an alternative solution given the surprising luminosity of these candidates. Finding such bright galaxies at z \~{} 9-10 suggests that the luminosity function for luminous galaxies might evolve in a complex way at z $\gt$ 8. The cosmic star formation rate density still shows, however, an order-of-magnitude increase from z \~{} 10 to z \~{} 8 since the dominant contribution comes from low-luminosity sources. Based on the IRAC detections, we derive galaxy stellar masses at z \~{} 10, finding that these luminous objects are typically 10$^{9}$ M $_{⊙}$. This allows for a first estimate of the cosmic stellar mass density at z \~{} 10 resulting in log \_$\{$10$\}$$\backslash$rho \_$\{$*$\}$ = 4.7\^{}$\{$+0.5$\}$\_$\{$-0.8$\}$ M $_{⊙}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ for galaxies brighter than M $_{UV}$ \~{} -18. The remarkable brightness, and hence luminosity, of these z \~{} 9-10 candidates will enable deep spectroscopy to determine their redshift and nature, and highlights the opportunity for the James Webb Space Telescope to map the buildup of galaxies at redshifts much earlier than z \~{} 10.

  abstract      = {We constrain the slope of the star formation rate (SFR; log {$\Psi$}) to stellar mass (log M $_{sstarf}$) relation down to log (M $_{sstarf}$/M $_{⊙}$) = 8.4 (log (M $_{sstarf}$/M $_{⊙}$) = 9.2) at z = 0.5 (z = 2.5) with a mass-complete sample of 39,106 star-forming galaxies selected from the 3D-HST photometric catalogs, using deep photometry in the CANDELS fields. For the first time, we find that the slope is dependent on stellar mass, such that it is steeper at low masses (log {$\Psi$}vproplog M $_{sstarf}$) than at high masses (log {$\Psi$}vprop(0.3-0.6)log M $_{sstarf}$). These steeper low-mass slopes are found for three different star formation indicators: the combination of the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR), calibrated from a stacking analysis of Spitzer/MIPS 24 {$\mu$}m imaging; {$\beta$}-corrected UV SFRs; and H{$\alpha$} SFRs. The normalization of the sequence evolves differently in distinct mass regimes as well: for galaxies less massive than log (M $_{sstarf}$/M $_{⊙}$) $\lt$ 10 the specific SFR ({$\Psi$}/M $_{sstarf}$) is observed to be roughly self-similar with {$\Psi$}/M $_{sstarf}$vprop(1 + z)$^{1.9}$, whereas more massive galaxies show a stronger evolution with {$\Psi$}/M $_{sstarf}$vprop(1 + z)$^{2.2-3.5}$ for log (M $_{sstarf}$/M $_{⊙}$) = 10.2-11.2. The fact that we find a steep slope of the star formation sequence for the lower mass galaxies will help reconcile theoretical galaxy formation models with the observations.},

We find a significant nonlinear slope of the relation, SFRvpropM $^{0.6}$ $_{sstarf}$, and a constant observed scatter of 0.34 dex, independent of redshift and M $_{sstarf}$. However, if we select only blue galaxies we find a linear relation SFRvpropM $_{sstarf}$, similar to previous results at z = 0 by Peng et al. This selection excludes red, dusty, star-forming galaxies with higher masses, which brings down the slope. By selecting on L $_{IR}$/L $_{UV}$ (a proxy for dust obscuration) and the rest-frame U - V colors, we show that star-forming galaxies fall in three distinct regions of the log(SFR)-log(M $_{sstarf}$) plane: (1) actively star-forming galaxies with ``normal'' dust obscuration and associated colors (54\% for log (M $_{sstarf}$) $\gt$ 10 at 1 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1.5), (2) red star-forming galaxies with low levels of dust obscuration and low-specific SFRs (11\%), and (3) dusty, blue star-forming galaxies with high-specific SFRs (7\%). The remaining 28\% comprises quiescent galaxies. Galaxies on the ``normal'' star formation sequence show strong trends of increasing dust attenuation with stellar mass and a decreasing specific SFR, with an observed scatter of 0.25 dex. The dusty, blue galaxies reside in the upper envelope of the star formation sequence with remarkably similar spectral shapes at all masses, suggesting that the same physical process is dominating the stellar light. The red, low-dust star-forming galaxies may be in the process of shutting off and migrating to the quiescent population.},

  abstract = {Using the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS), we have assembled a complete sample of 20 K-selected galaxies at 2.0$\lt$z$\lt$2.7 with high-quality near-infrared spectra. As described in a previous paper, 9 of these 20 galaxies have strongly suppressed star formation and no detected emission lines. The present paper concerns the 11 galaxies with detected H{$\alpha$} emission and studies the origin of the line emission using the GNIRS spectra and follow-up observations with SINFONI on the VLT. Based on their [N II]/H{$\alpha$} ratios, the spatial extent of the line emission, and several other diagnostics, we infer that 4 of the 11 emission-line galaxies host narrow-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The AGN host galaxies have stellar populations ranging from evolved to star-forming. Combining our sample with a UV-selected galaxy sample at the same redshift that spans a broader range in stellar mass, we find that black hole accretion is more effective at the high-mass end of the galaxy distribution (\~{}2.9{\times}10$^{11}$ M$_{solar}$) at z\~{}2.3. Furthermore, by comparing our results with SDSS data, we show that the AGN activity in massive galaxies has decreased significantly between z\~{}2.3 and 0. AGNs with similar normalized accretion rates as those detected in our K-selected galaxies reside in less massive galaxies (\~{}4.0{\times}10$^{10}$ M$_{solar}$) at low redshift. This is direct evidence for downsizing of AGN host galaxies. Finally, we speculate that the typical stellar mass scale of the actively accreting AGN host galaxies, both at low and at high redshift, might be similar to the mass scale at which star-forming galaxies seem to transform into red, passive systems.

Here we determine the sizes of these quiescent galaxies using deep, high-resolution images obtained with HST/NIC2 and laser guide star (LGS)-assisted Keck/adaptive optics (AO). Considering that their median stellar mass is 1.7 {\times} 10$^{11}$ M$_{⊙}$, the galaxies are remarkably small, with a median effective radius r$_{e}$ = 0.9 kpc. Galaxies of similar mass in the nearby universe have sizes of {\ap}5 kpc and average stellar densities that are 2 orders of magnitude lower than the z \~{} 2.3 galaxies. These results extend earlier work at z \~{} 1.5 and confirm previous studies at z $\gt$ 2 that lacked spectroscopic redshifts and imaging of sufficient resolution to resolve the galaxies. Our findings demonstrate that fully assembled early-type galaxies make up at most \~{}10\% of the population of K-selected quiescent galaxies at z \~{} 2.3, effectively ruling out simple monolithic models for their formation. The galaxies must evolve significantly after z \~{} 2.3, through dry mergers or other processes, consistent with predictions from hierarchical models.},

  abstract = {We present deep 3.6-8 {$\mu$}m imaging of the Hubble Deep Field-South with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope. We study distant red galaxies (DRGs) at z$\gt$2 selected by J$_{s}$-K$_{s}$$\gt$2.3 and compare them with a sample of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at z=2-3. The observed UV-to-8 {$\mu$}m spectral energy distributions are fitted with stellar population models to constrain star formation histories and derive stellar masses. We find that 70\% of the DRGs are best described by dust-reddened star-forming models and 30\% are very well fitted with old and ``dead'' models. Using only the I-K$_{s}$ and K$_{s}$-4.5 {$\mu$}m colors, we can effectively separate the two groups. The dead systems are among the most massive at z\~{}2.5 (mean stellar mass $\lt$M$_{*}$$\gt$= 0.8{\times}10$^{11}$ M$_{solar}$) and likely formed most of their stellar mass at z$\gt$5. To a limit of 0.5{\times}10$^{11}$ M$_{solar}$, their number density is \~{}10 times lower than that of local early-type galaxies. Furthermore, we use the IRAC photometry to derive rest-frame near-infrared J, H, and K fluxes. The DRGs and LBGs together show a large variation (a factor of 6) in the rest-frame K-band mass-to-light ratios (M/L$_{K}$), implying that even a Spitzer 8 {$\mu$}m-selected sample would be very different from a mass-selected sample. The average M/L$_{K}$ of the DRGs is about 3 times higher than that of the LBGs, and DRGs dominate the high-mass end. The M/L$_{K}$ values and ages of the two samples appear to correlate with derived stellar mass, with the most massive galaxies being the oldest and having the highest mass-to-light ratios, similar to what is found in the low-redshift universe.

We first show that star-forming galaxies and quiescent galaxies can be robustly separated with a two-color criterion over this entire redshift range. We then study the evolution of the number density and mass density of quiescent and star-forming galaxies, extending the results of the COMBO-17, DEEP2, and other surveys to z = 2.2. The mass density of quiescent galaxies with M $\gt$\~{} 3 {\times} 10$^{10}$ M $_{sun}$ increases by a factor of \~{}10 from z \~{} 2 to the present day, whereas the mass density in star-forming galaxies is flat or decreases over the same time period. Modest mass growth by a factor of \~{}2 of individual quiescent galaxies can explain roughly half of the strong density evolution at masses $\gt$10$^{11}$ M $_{sun}$, due to the steepness of the exponential tail of the mass function. The rest of the density evolution of massive, quiescent galaxies is likely due to transformation (e.g., quenching) of the massive star-forming population, a conclusion which is consistent with the density evolution we observe for the star-forming galaxies themselves, which is flat or decreasing with cosmic time. Modest mass growth does not explain the evolution of less massive quiescent galaxies (\~{}10$^{10.5}$ M $_{sun}$), which show a similarly steep increase in their number densities. The less massive quiescent galaxies are therefore continuously formed by transforming galaxies from the star-forming population.},

  abstract      = {We investigate star formation rates (SFRs) of quiescent galaxies at high redshift (0.3 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2.5) using 3D-HST WFC3 grism spectroscopy and Spitzer mid-infrared data. We select quiescent galaxies on the basis of the widely used UVJ color-color criteria. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting (rest-frame optical and near-IR) indicates very low SFRs for quiescent galaxies (sSFR \~{} 10$^{-12}$ yr$^{-1}$). However, SED fitting can miss star formation if it is hidden behind high dust obscuration and ionizing radiation is re-emitted in the mid-infrared. It is therefore fundamental to measure the dust-obscured SFRs with a mid-IR indicator. We stack the MIPS 24 {$\mu$}m images of quiescent objects in five redshift bins centered on z = 0.5, 0.9, 1.2, 1.7, 2.2 and perform aperture photometry. Including direct 24 {$\mu$}m detections, we find sSFR \~{} 10$^{-11.9}$ {\times} (1 + z)$^{4}$ yr$^{-1}$. These values are higher than those indicated by SED fitting, but at each redshift they are 20-40 times lower than those of typical star-forming galaxies. The true SFRs of quiescent galaxies might be even lower, as we show that the mid-IR fluxes can be due to processes unrelated to ongoing star formation, such as cirrus dust heated by old stellar populations and circumstellar dust. Our measurements show that star formation quenching is very efficient at every redshift. The measured SFR values are at z $\gt$ 1.5 marginally consistent with the ones expected from gas recycling (assuming that mass loss from evolved stars refuels star formation) and well below that at lower redshifts.},

  abstract      = {We study the growth of massive galaxies from z = 2 to the present using data from the NOAO/Yale NEWFIRM Medium Band Survey. The sample is selected at a constant number density of n = 2 {\times} 10$^{-4}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, so that galaxies at different epochs can be compared in a meaningful way. We show that the stellar mass of galaxies at this number density has increased by a factor of {\ap}2 since z = 2, following the relation log M$_{n}$ (z) = 11.45 - 0.15z. In order to determine at what physical radii this mass growth occurred, we construct very deep stacked rest-frame R-band images of galaxies with masses near M$_{n}$ (z), at redshifts langzrang = 0.6, 1.1, 1.6, and 2.0. These image stacks of typically 70-80 galaxies enable us to characterize the stellar distribution to surface brightness limits of \~{}28.5 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. We find that massive galaxies gradually built up their outer regions over the past 10 Gyr. The mass within a radius of r = 5 kpc is nearly constant with redshift, whereas the mass at 5 kpc $\lt$ r $\lt$ 75 kpc has increased by a factor of \~{}4 since z = 2. Parameterizing the surface brightness profiles, we find that the effective radius and Sersic n parameter evolve as r$_{e}$ vprop (1 + z)$^{-1.3}$ and n vprop (1 + z)$^{-1.0}$, respectively. The data demonstrate that massive galaxies have grown mostly inside-out, assembling their extended stellar halos around compact, dense cores with possibly exponential radial density distributions. Comparing the observed mass evolution to the average star formation rates of the galaxies we find that the growth is likely dominated by mergers, as in situ star formation can only account for \~{}20\% of the mass buildup from z = 2 to z = 0. A direct consequence of these results is that massive galaxies do not evolve in a self-similar way: their structural profiles change as a function of redshift, complicating analyses which (often implicitly) assume self-similarity. The main uncertainties in this study are possible redshift-dependent systematic errors in the total stellar masses and the conversion from light-weighted to mass-weighted radial profiles.},

We show that a stellar HeII{$\lambda$}1640 emission line, produced in the expanding atmospheres of Of and Wolf-Rayet stars, should be detectable with an equivalent width of 0.5-1.5{\AA} in the integrated spectra of star-forming galaxies, provided the metallicity is greater than about half solar. Our models reproduce the strength of the HeII{$\lambda$}1640 line measured in the spectra of Lyman-break galaxies for established values of their metallicities. With better empirical calibrations in local galaxies, this spectral feature has the potential of becoming a useful diagnostic of massive star winds at high, as well as low redshifts.  We also uncover a relationship in SDSS galaxies between their location in the [OIII]/H{$\beta$} versus [NII]/H{$\alpha$} diagnostic diagram (the BPT diagram) and their excess specific star formation rate relative to galaxies of similar mass. We infer that an elevated ionization parameter U is at the root of this effect, and propose that this is also the cause of the offset of high-redshift star-forming galaxies in the BPT diagram compared to local ones. We further speculate that higher electron densities and escape fractions of hydrogen ionizing photons may be the factors responsible for the systematically higher values of U in the HII regions of high-redshift galaxies. The impact of such differences on abundance determinations from strong nebular lines are considered and found to be relatively minor.},

We show unambiguously that the locus of z \~{} 2.3 galaxies in the ``BPT'' nebular diagnostic diagram exhibits an almost entirely disjointed, yet similarly tight, relationship between the line ratios [N II] {$\lambda$}6585/H{$\alpha$} and [O III]/H{$\beta$} as compared to local galaxies. Using photoionization models, we argue that the offset of the z \~{} 2.3 BPT locus relative to that at z \~{} 0 is caused by a combination of harder stellar ionizing radiation field, higher ionization parameter, and higher N/O at a given O/H compared to most local galaxies, and that the position of a galaxy along the z \~{} 2.3 star-forming BPT locus is surprisingly insensitive to gas-phase oxygen abundance. The observed nebular emission line ratios are most easily reproduced by models in which the net stellar ionizing radiation field resembles a blackbody with effective temperature T $_{eff}$ = 50, 000-60, 000 K, the gas-phase oxygen abundances lie in the range 0.2 $\lt$ Z/Z $_{⊙}$ $\lt$ 1.0, and the ratio of gas-phase N/O is close to the solar value. We critically assess the applicability at high redshift of commonly used strong line indices for estimating gas-phase metallicity, and consider the implications of the small intrinsic scatter of the empirical relationship between excitation-sensitive line indices and M $_{*}$ (i.e., the ``mass-metallicity'' relation) at z \~{}= 2.3.

  abstract      = {We present results on the excitation properties of z {\tilde} 2.3 galaxies using early observations from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) Survey. With its coverage of the full suite of strong rest-frame optical emission lines, MOSDEF provides an unprecedented view of the rest-frame optical spectra of a representative sample of distant star-forming galaxies. We investigate the locations of z {\tilde} 2.3 MOSDEF galaxies in multiple emission-line diagnostic diagrams. These include the [O iii]{$\lambda$}5007/H{$\beta$} vs. [N ii]/H{$\alpha$} and [O iii]{$\lambda$}5007/H{$\beta$} vs. [S ii]{$\lambda$}{$\lambda$}6717, 6731/H{$\alpha$} {\ldquo}BPT{\rdquo} diagrams, as well as the O$_{32}$ vs. R$_{23}$ excitation diagram. We recover the well-known offset in the star-forming sequence of high-redshift galaxies in the [O iii]{$\lambda$}5007/H{$\beta$} vs. [N ii]/H{$\alpha$} BPT diagram relative to Sloan Digital Sky Survey star-forming galaxies. However, the shift for our rest-frame optically selected sample is less significant than for rest-frame-UV selected and emission-line selected galaxies at z {\tilde} 2. Furthermore, we find that the offset is mass-dependent, only appearing within the low-mass half of the z {\tilde} 2.3 MOSDEF sample, where galaxies are shifted toward higher [N ii]/H{$\alpha$} at fixed [O iii]/H{$\beta$}. Within the [O iii]{$\lambda$}5007/H{$\beta$} vs. [S ii]/H{$\alpha$} and O$_{32}$ vs. R$_{23}$ diagrams, we find that z {\tilde} 2.3 galaxies are distributed like local ones, and therefore attribute the shift in the [O iii]{$\lambda$}5007/H{$\beta$} vs. [N ii]/H{$\alpha$} BPT diagram to elevated N/O abundance ratios among lower-mass ($\{$$\{$M$\}$$_{*}$$\}$$\backslash$lt $\{$$\{$10$\}$$^{10}$$\}$ $\{$$\{$M$\}$$_{⊙ }$$\}$) high-redshift galaxies. The variation in N/O ratios calls into question the use at high redshift of oxygen abundance indicators based on nitrogen lines, but the apparent invariance with redshift of the excitation sequence in the O$_{32}$ vs. R$_{23}$ diagram paves the way for using the combination of O$_{32}$ and R$_{23}$ as an unbiased metallicity indicator over a wide range in redshift. This indicator will allow for an accurate characterization of the shape and normalization of the mass-metallicity relationship over more than 10 Gyr.  Based on data obtained at the W. M.

  abstract = {We study massive galaxies at z\~{}1-3.5 using HST optical imaging, ground-based near-IR imaging, and Spitzer observations at 3-24 {$\mu$}m. From K$_{s}$-selected galaxies in the \~{}=130 arcmin$^{2}$ GOODS-S field, we identify 153 distant red galaxies (DRGs) with (J-K$_{s}$)$_{Vega}$$\gt$=2.3. This sample is approximately complete in stellar mass for passively evolving galaxies above 10$^{11}$ M$_{solar}$ and z$\lt$=3. Roughly half of the DRGs are objects whose optical and near-IR rest-frame light is dominated by evolved stars combined with ongoing star formation (at z$_{med}$\~{}2.5), and the others are galaxies whose light is dominated by heavily reddened (A$_{1600}$$\gt$\~{}4-6 mag) starbursts (at z$_{med}$\~{}1.7). Very few DRGs ($\lt$\~{}10\%) have no indication of current star formation. DRGs at z\~{}1.5-3 with stellar masses $\gt$=10$^{11}$ M$_{solar}$ have specific star formation rates (SFRs per unit mass) including the reradiated far-IR emission that range from 0.2 to 10 Gyr$^{-1}$. Based on the X-ray luminosities and rest-frame near-IR colors, roughly one-quarter of the DRGs contain AGNs, implying that the growth of supermassive black holes coincides with the formation of massive galaxies. At 1.5$\lt$=z$\lt$=3, the DRGs with M$\gt$=10$^{11}$ M$_{solar}$ have an integrated specific SFR comparable to the global value of all galaxies. In contrast, galaxies at z\~{}0.3-0.75 with M$\gt$=10$^{11}$ M$_{solar}$ have an integrated specific SFR less than the global value and more than an order of magnitude lower than that for massive DRGs. At z$\lt$\~{}1, lower mass galaxies dominate the overall cosmic mass assembly. This suggests that the bulk of star formation in massive galaxies occurs at early cosmic epochs and is largely complete by z\~{}1.5. Further mass assembly in these galaxies takes place with low specific SFRs.  This work is based in part on observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under NASA contract 1407; on observations taken with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555 and on observations collected at the Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO), National Optical Astronomical Observatory (NOAO), which is operated by AURA, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.

These galaxies also display some near-IR excess in Spitzer IRAC data, with an SED peaking longward of 1.6 {$\mu$}m in the rest frame, indicating the presence of warm dust emission usually absent in star-forming galaxies. Stacking Chandra data for the mid-IR excess galaxies yields a significant hard X-ray detection at rest-frame energies $\gt$6.2 keV. The stacked X-ray spectrum rises steeply at $\gt$10 keV, suggesting that these sources host Compton-thick AGNs with column densities N$_{H}$$\gt$\~{}10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$ and an average, unobscured X-ray luminosity L$_{2-8keV}$\~{}(1-4){\times}10$^{43}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. Their sky density (\~{}3200 deg$^{-2}$) and space density (\~{}2.6{\times}10$^{-4}$ Mpc$^{-3}$) are twice those of X-ray-detected AGNs at z\~{}2, and much larger than those of previously known Compton-thick sources at similar redshifts. The mid-IR excess galaxies are part of the long sought after population of distant heavily obscured AGNs predicted by synthesis models of the X-ray background. The fraction of mid-IR excess objects increases with galaxy mass, reaching \~{}50\%-60\% for M\~{}10$^{11}$ M$_{solar}$, an effect likely connected with downsizing in galaxy formation. The ratio of the inferred black hole growth rate from these Compton-thick sources to the global star formation rate at z=2 is similar to the mass ratio of black holes to stars in local spheroids, implying concurrent growth of both within the precursors of today's massive galaxies.},

  abstract      = {We report the detection of ubiquitous powerful nuclear outflows in massive ($\gt$=10$^{11}$ M $_{⊙}$) z \~{} 2 star-forming galaxies (SFGs), which are plausibly driven by an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The sample consists of the eight most massive SFGs from our SINS/zC-SINF survey of galaxy kinematics with the imaging spectrometer SINFONI, six of which have sensitive high-resolution adaptive optics-assisted observations. All of the objects are disks hosting a significant stellar bulge. The spectra in their central regions exhibit a broad component in H{$\alpha$} and forbidden [N II] and [S II] line emission, with typical velocity FWHM \~{} 1500 km s$^{-1}$, [N II]/H{$\alpha$} ratio {\ap} 0.6, and intrinsic extent of 2-3 kpc. These properties are consistent with warm ionized gas outflows associated with Type 2 AGN, the presence of which is confirmed via independent diagnostics in half the galaxies. The data imply a median ionized gas mass outflow rate of \~{}60 M $_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$ and mass loading of \~{}3. At larger radii, a weaker broad component is detected but with lower FWHM \~{}485 km s$^{-1}$ and [N II]/H{$\alpha$} {\ap} 0.35, characteristic for star formation-driven outflows as found in the lower-mass SINS/zC-SINF galaxies. The high inferred mass outflow rates and frequent occurrence suggest that the nuclear outflows efficiently expel gas out of the centers of the galaxies with high duty cycles and may thus contribute to the process of star formation quenching in massive galaxies. Larger samples at high masses will be crucial in confirming the importance and energetics of the nuclear outflow phenomenon and its connection to AGN activity and bulge growth.

We find a fairly sharp onset of the incidence of broad nuclear emission (FWHM in the H{$\alpha$}, [N II], and [S II] lines \~{}450-5300 km s$^{-1}$), with large [N II]/H{$\alpha$} ratios, above log(M $_{*}$/M $_{⊙}$) \~{} 10.9, with about two-thirds of the galaxies in this mass range exhibiting this component. Broad nuclear components near and above the Schechter mass are similarly prevalent above and below the main sequence of star-forming galaxies, and at z \~{} 1 and \~{}2. The line ratios of the nuclear component are fit by excitation from active galactic nuclei (AGNs), or by a combination of shocks and photoionization. The incidence of the most massive galaxies with broad nuclear components is at least as large as that of AGNs identified by X-ray, optical, infrared, or radio indicators. The mass loading of the nuclear outflows is near unity. Our findings provide compelling evidence for powerful, high-duty cycle, AGN-driven outflows near the Schechter mass, and acting across the peak of cosmic galaxy formation.

  abstract      = {Much of our knowledge of galaxies comes from analysing the radiation emitted by their stars, which depends on the present number of each type of star in the galaxy. The present number depends on the stellar initial mass function (IMF), which describes the distribution of stellar masses when the population formed, and knowledge of it is critical to almost every aspect of galaxy evolution. More than 50 years after the first IMF determination, no consensus has emerged on whether it is universal among different types of galaxies. Previous studies indicated that the IMF and the dark matter fraction in galaxy centres cannot both be universal, but they could not convincingly discriminate between the two possibilities. Only recently were indications found that massive elliptical galaxies may not have the same IMF as the Milky Way. Here we report a study of the two-dimensional stellar kinematics for the large representative ATLAS$^{3D}$ sample of nearby early-type galaxies spanning two orders of magnitude in stellar mass, using detailed dynamical models. We find a strong systematic variation in IMF in early-type galaxies as a function of their stellar mass-to-light ratios, producing differences of a factor of up to three in galactic stellar mass. This implies that a galaxy's IMF depends intimately on the galaxy's formation history.},

  abstract      = {We present Gemini-North GMOS-IFU observations of the central starburst clumps and inner wind of M82, together with WIYN DensePak IFU observations of the inner 2 {\times} 0.9 kpc of the disk. These cover the emission lines of H{$\alpha$}, [N II], [S II], and [S III] at a spectral resolution of 45-80 km s$^{-1}$. The high signal-to-noise of the data is sufficient to accurately decompose the emission line profiles into multiple narrow components (FWHM \~{} 30-130 km s$^{-1}$) superimposed on a broad (FWHM \~{} 150-350 km s$^{-1}$) feature. This paper is the first of a series examining the optical structure of M82's disk and inner wind; here we focus on the ionized gaseous and stellar dynamics and present maps of the relevant emission line properties. Our observations show that ionized gas in the starburst core of M82 is dynamically complex with many overlapping expanding structures located at different radii. Localised line splitting of up to 100 km s$^{-1}$ in the narrow component is associated with expanding shells of compressed, cool, photoionized gas at the roots of the superwind outflow. We have been able to associate some of this inner-wind gas with a distinct outflow channel characterised by its dynamics and gas density patterns, and we discuss the consequences of this discovery in terms of the developing wind outflow. The broad optical emission line component is observed to become increasingly important moving outward along the outflow channel, and in general with increasing height above/below the plane. Following our recent work on the origins of this component, we associate it with turbulent gas in wind-clump interface layers and hence sites of mass loading, meaning that the turbulent mixing of cooler gas into the outflowing hot gas must become increasingly important with height, and provides powerful direct evidence for the existence of mass-loading over a large, spatially extended area reaching far into the inner wind. We discuss the consequences and implications of this. We confirm that the rotation axis of the ionized emission-line gas is offset from the stellar rotation axis and the photometric major axis by \~{}12{\deg}, not only within the nuclear regions but over the whole inner 2 kpc of the disk. This attests to the perturbations introduced from M82's past interactions within the M81 group. Finally, finding a turn-over in the stellar and ionized gas rotation curves on both sides of the galaxy indicates that our sight line, in places, extends at least half way through disk, and conflicts with the high levels of obscuration usually associated with the nuclear regions of M82.

  abstract      = {An important property of star-forming galaxies at z \~{} 1-2 is the high local star-formation intensities they maintain over tens of kiloparsecs at levels that are only observed in the nearby Universe in the most powerful nuclear starbursts. To investigate how these high star-formation intensities affect the warm ionized medium, we present an analysis of the average spectra of about 50 such galaxies at z {\ap} 1.2-2.6 and of subsamples selected according to their local and global star-formation intensity. Stacking allows us to probe relatively weak lines like [Sii]{$\lambda$}{$\lambda$}6716,6731 and [Oi]{$\lambda$}6300, which are tracers of the conditions of the ISM and are undetectable in most individual targets. We find higher gas densities (hence pressures) in intensely star-forming regions compared to fainter diffuse gas and, overall, values that are comparable to starburst regions and the diffuse ISM in nearby galaxies. By modeling the H{$\alpha$} surface brightnesses and [Sii]/H{$\alpha$} line ratios with the Cloudy photoionization code, we find that our galaxies continue trends observed in local galaxies, where gas pressures scale with star-formation intensity. We discuss these results in the context of models of self-regulated star formation, where star formation determines the average thermal and turbulent pressure in the ISM, which in turn determines the rate at which stars can form, finding good agreement with our data. We also confirm the detection of broad, faint lines underlying H{$\alpha$} and [Nii], which have previously been considered evidence of either outflows or active galactic nuclei. Finding that the broad component is only significantly detected in stacks with the highest average local and global star-formation intensities strongly supports the outflow interpretation, and further emphasizes the importance of star-formation feedback and self-regulation in the early Universe.

  abstract      = {We report ALMA Cycle 0 observations at 1.3 mm of LESS J033229.4-275619 (XID403), an ultraluminous infrared galaxy at z = 4.75 in the Chandra Deep Field South hosting a Compton-thick QSO. The source is not resolved in our data at a resolution of \~{}0.75 arcsec, placing an upper-limit of 2.5 kpc to the half-light radius of the continuum emission from heated-dust. After deconvolving for the beam size, however, we found a \~{}3{$\sigma$} indication of an intrinsic source size of 0.27 {\plusmn} 0.08 arcsec (Gaussian FWHM), which would correspond to r$_{half}$ \~{} 0.9 {\plusmn} 0.3 kpc. We build the far-infrared SED of XID403 by combining datapoints from both ALMA and Herschel and fit it with a modified blackbody spectrum. For the first time, we measure the dust temperature T$_{d}$ = 58.5 {\plusmn} 5.3 K in this system, which is comparable to what has been observed in other high-z submillimeter galaxies. The measured star formation rate is SFR = 1020 {\plusmn} 150 M$_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$, in agreement with previous estimates at lower S/N. Based on the measured SFR and source size, we constrain the SFR surface density to be {$\Sigma$}$_{SFR}$ $\gt$ 26M$_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$ (\~{}200M$_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$ for r$_{half}$ \~{} 0.9 kpc). The compactness of this starburst is comparable to what has been observed in other local and high-z starburst galaxies. If the gas mass measured from previous [CII] and CO(2-1) observations at low resolution is confined within the same dust region, assuming r$_{half}$ \~{} 0.9 {\plusmn} 0.3 kpc, this would produce a column density of N$_{H}$ \~{} 0.3-1.1 {\times} 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$ towards the central SMBH, similar to the column density of {\ap}1.4 {\times} 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$ measured from the X-rays. Then, in principle, if both gas and dust were confined on sub-kpc scales, this would be sufficient to produce the observed X-ray column density without any need of a pc-scale absorber (e.g. the torus postulated by Unified Models). We speculate that the high compactness of star formation, together with the presence of a powerful AGN, likely produce an outflowing wind. This would be consistent with the \~{}350 km s$^{-1}$ velocity shift observed between the Ly{$\alpha$} emission and the submm lines ([CII], CO(2-1), [NII]) and with the highly-ionized Fe emission line at \~{}6.9 keV rest-frame tentatively observed in the X-ray spectrum. Finally, our observations show that, besides the mass, star formation rate and gas depletion timescale, XID403 has also the right size to be one of the progenitors of the compact quiescent massive galaxies seen at z \~{} 3.},

  abstract      = {It has been widely remarked that compact, massive, elliptical-like galaxies are abundant at high redshifts but exceedingly rare in the universe today, implying significant evolution such that their sizes at z {\tilde} 2 {\plusmn} 0.6 have increased by factors of 3 to 6 to become today{\rsquo}s massive elliptical galaxies. These claims have been based on studies that measured the half-light radii of galaxies as though they are all single-component systems. Here we identify 21 spheroidal stellar systems within 90 Mpc that have half-light, major-axis radii $\{$$\{$R$\}$$_{e}$$\}${\lsim} 2 kpc, stellar masses 0.7{\times} $\{$$\{$10$\}$$^{11}$$\}$$\backslash$lt $\{$$\{$M$\}$$_{*}$$\}$/ $\{$$\{$M$\}$$_{⊙ }$$\}$$\backslash$lt 1.4{\times} $\{$$\{$10$\}$$^{11}$$\}$, and S{\'e}rsic indices typically around a value of n = 2-3. This abundance of compact, massive spheroids in our own backyard{\mdash}with a number density of 6.9{\times} $\{$$\{$10$\}$$^{-6}$$\}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ (or 3.5 {\times} 10$^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ per unit dex$^{-1}$ in stellar mass){\mdash}and with the same physical properties as the high-redshift galaxies, had been overlooked because they are encased in stellar disks that usually result in galaxy sizes notably larger than 2 kpc. Moreover, this number density is a lower limit because it has not come from a volume-limited sample. The actual density may be closer to 10$^{-4}$, although further work is required to confirm this. We therefore conclude that not all massive {\ldquo}spheroids{\rdquo} have undergone dramatic structural and size evolution since z {\tilde} 2 {\plusmn} 0.6. Given that the bulges of local early-type disk galaxies are known to consist of predominantly old stars that existed at z {\tilde} 2, it seems likely that some of the observed high-redshift spheroids did not increase in size by building (three-dimensional) triaxial envelopes as commonly advocated, and that the growth of (two-dimensional) disks has also been important over the past 9-11 billion years.},

  abstract      = {We study the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) sizes of massive (˜ 0.8× {10}11{M}⊙ ) galaxies at 3.4≤slant z\lt 4.2, selected from the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey, by fitting single Sérsic profiles to Hubble Space Telescope/WFC3/F160W images from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey. Massive quiescent galaxies are very compact, with a median circularized half-light radius {r}{{e}}=0.63+/- 0.18 kpc. Removing 5/16 (31%) sources with signs of active galactic nucleus activity does not change the result. Star-forming galaxies have {r}{{e}}=2.0+/- 0.60 kpc, 3.2+/- 1.3× larger than quiescent galaxies. Quiescent galaxies at z˜ 4 are on average 6.0+/- 1.7× smaller than at z˜ 0 and 1.9+/- 0.7× smaller than at z˜ 2. Star-forming galaxies of the same stellar mass are 2.4+/- 0.7× smaller than at z˜ 0. Overall, the size evolution at 0\lt z\lt 4 is well described by a power law, with {r}{{e}}=5.08+/- 0.28{(1+z)}-1.44+/- 0.08 kpc for quiescent galaxies and {r}{{e}}=6.02+/- 0.28{(1+z)}-0.72+/- 0.05 kpc for star-forming galaxies. Compact star-forming galaxies are rare in our sample: we find only 1/14 (7%) with {r}{{e}}/{(M/{10}11{M}⊙ )}0.75\lt 1.5, whereas 13/16 (81%) of the quiescent galaxies are compact. The number density of compact quiescent galaxies at z˜ 4 is 1.8+/- 0.8× {10}-5 {{Mpc}}-3 and increases rapidly, by \gt 5× , between 2\lt z\lt 4. The paucity of compact star-forming galaxies at z˜ 4 and their large rest-frame UV median sizes suggest that the formation phase of compact cores is very short and/or highly dust obscured.

  abstract      = {Using a high-resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulation of the formation of a massive spheroidal galaxy we show that elliptical galaxies can be very compact and massive at high redshift in agreement with recent observations. Accretion of stripped infalling stellar material increases the size of the system with time and the central concentration is reduced by dynamical friction of the surviving stellar cores. In a specific case of a spheroidal galaxy with a final stellar mass of 1.5 {\times} 10$^{11}$ M $_{sun}$ we find that the effective radius r$_{e}$ increases from 0.7 {\plusmn} 0.2 kpc at z = 3 to r$_{e}$ = 2.4 {\plusmn} 0.4 kpc at z = 0 with a concomitant decrease in the effective density of an order of magnitude and a decrease of the central velocity dispersion by approximately 20\% over this time interval. A simple argument based on the virial theorem shows that during the accretion of weakly bound material (minor mergers) the radius can increase as the square of the mass in contrast to the usual linear rate of increase for major mergers. By undergoing minor mergers compact high-redshift spheroids can evolve into present-day systems with sizes and concentrations similar to observed local ellipticals. This indicates that minor mergers may be the main driver for the late evolution of sizes and densities of early-type galaxies.},

  abstract      = {We present evidence for very high gas fractions and extended molecular gas reservoirs in normal, near-infrared-selected (BzK) galaxies at z \~{} 1.5. Our results are based on multi-configuration CO[2-1] observations obtained at the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer. All six star-forming galaxies observed were detected at high significance. High spatial resolution observations resolve the CO emission in four of them, implying sizes of the gas reservoirs of order of 6-11 kpc and suggesting the presence of ordered rotation. The galaxies have UV morphologies consistent with clumpy, unstable disks, and UV sizes that are consistent with those measured in CO. The star formation efficiencies are homogeneously low within the sample and similar to those of local spirals{\mdash}the resulting gas depletion times are \~{}0.5 Gyr, much higher than what is seen in high-z submillimeter galaxies and quasars. The CO luminosities can be predicted to within 0.15 dex from the observed star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses, implying a tight correlation of the gas mass with these quantities. We use new dynamical models of clumpy disk galaxies to derive dynamical masses for our sample. These models are able to reproduce the peculiar spectral line shapes of the CO emission. After accounting for the stellar and dark matter masses, we derive molecular gas reservoirs with masses of (0.4-1.2){\times}10$^{11}$ M $_{sun}$. The implied conversion (CO luminosity-to-gas mass) factor is very high: {$\alpha$}$_{CO}$ = 3.6 {\plusmn} 0.8, consistent with a Galactic conversion factor but 4 times higher than that of local ultra-luminous IR galaxies that is typically used for high-redshift objects. The gas mass in these galaxies is comparable to or larger than the stellar mass, and the gas accounts for an impressive 50\%-65\% of the baryons within the galaxies' half-light radii. We are thus witnessing truly gas-dominated galaxies at z \~{} 1.5, a finding that explains the high specific SFRs observed for z $\gt$ 1 galaxies. The BzK galaxies can be viewed as scaled-up versions of local disk galaxies, with low-efficiency star formation taking place inside extended, low-excitation gas disks. These galaxies are markedly different than local ULIRGs and high-z submillimeter galaxies and quasars, where higher excitation and more compact gas is found.},

The new data reveal for the first time spatially resolved CO gas kinematics in the observed SMGs. Two of the SMGs show double or multiple morphologies, with complex, disturbed gas motions. The other two SMGs exhibit CO velocity gradients of \~{}500 km s$^{-1}$ across $\lt$=0.2$^{''}$ (1.6 kpc) diameter regions, suggesting that the star-forming gas is in compact, rotating disks. Our data provide compelling evidence that these SMGs represent extreme, short-lived ``maximum'' star-forming events in highly dissipative mergers of gas-rich galaxies. The resulting high-mass surface and volume densities of SMGs are similar to those of compact quiescent galaxies in the same redshift range and much higher than those in local spheroids. From the ratio of the comoving volume densities of SMGs and quiescent galaxies in the same mass and redshift ranges, and from the comparison of gas exhaustion timescales and stellar ages, we estimate that the SMG phase duration is about 100 Myr. Our analysis of SMGs and optically/UV selected high-redshift star-forming galaxies supports a ``universal'' Chabrier IMF as being valid over the star-forming history of these galaxies. We find that the $^{12}$CO luminosity to total gas mass conversion factors at z \~{} 2-3 are probably similar to those assumed at z \~{} 0.

The unique combination of rest-frame optical imaging and nebular emission-line maps provides simultaneous insight into morphologies and dynamical properties. The overall rest-frame optical emission of the galaxies is characterized by shallow profiles in general (S{\'e}rsic index n $\lt$ 1), with median effective radii of R $_{e}$ \~{} 5 kpc. The morphologies are significantly clumpy and irregular, which we quantify through a non-parametric morphological approach, estimating the Gini (G), multiplicity ({$\Psi$}), and M $_{20}$ coefficients. The estimated strength of the rest-frame optical emission lines in the F160W bandpass indicates that the observed structure is not dominated by the morphology of line-emitting gas, and must reflect the underlying stellar mass distribution of the galaxies. The sizes and structural parameters in the rest-frame optical continuum and H{$\alpha$} emission reveal no significant differences, suggesting similar global distributions of the ongoing star formation and more evolved stellar population. While no strong correlations are observed between stellar population parameters and morphology within the NIC2/SINFONI sample itself, a consideration of the sample in the context of a broader range of z \~{} 2 galaxy types (K-selected quiescent, active galactic nucleus, and star forming; 24 {$\mu$}m selected dusty, infrared-luminous) indicates that these galaxies probe the high specific star formation rate and low stellar mass surface density part of the massive z \~{} 2 galaxy population, with correspondingly large effective radii, low S{\'e}rsic indices, low G, and high {$\Psi$} and M $_{20}$. The combined NIC2 and SINFONI data set yields insights of unprecedented detail into the nature of mass accretion at high redshift.

The z\~{}0.5 data are combined with published data for 11 additional clusters at 0.18$\lt$=z$\lt$=1.28, to determine the evolution of the mean M/L$_{B}$ ratio of cluster galaxies with masses M$\gt$\~{}10$^{11}$ M$_{solar}$, as implied by the FP. We find dlog(M/L$_{B}$)/dz=-0.555+/-0.042, stronger evolution than was previously inferred from smaller samples. The observed evolution depends on the luminosity-weighted mean age of the stars in the galaxies, the IMF, selection effects due to progenitor bias, and other parameters. Assuming a normal IMF but allowing for various other sources of uncertainty, we find z$_{*}$=2.01$^{+0.22}$$_{-0.17}$ for the luminosity-weighted mean star formation epoch. The main uncertainty is the slope of the IMF in the range 1-2 M$_{solar}$: we find z$_{*}$=4.0 for a top-heavy IMF with slope x=0. The M/L$_{B}$ ratios of the cluster galaxies are compared to those of field early-type galaxies at 0.32$\lt$=z$\lt$=1.14. Assuming that progenitor bias and the IMF do not depend on environment, we find that the present-day age of stars in massive field galaxies is 4.1\%+/-2.0\% (\~{}0.4 Gyr) less than that of stars in massive cluster galaxies. This relatively small age difference is surprising in the context of expectations from ``standard'' hierarchical galaxy formation models and provides a constraint on the physical processes that are responsible for halting star formation in the progenitors of today's most massive galaxies.

  abstract = {The cluster CL 1358+62 displays a prominent red arc in WFPC2 images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. Keck spectra of the arc show Ly{$\alpha$} emission at 7204 {\AA}, a continuum drop blueward of the line, and several absorption lines to the red. We identify the arc as a gravitationally lensed galaxy at a redshift of z = 4.92. It is the highest redshift object currently known. A gravitational lens model was used to reconstruct images of the high-redshift galaxy. The reconstructed image is asymmetric, containing a bright knot and a patch of extended emission 0.4`` from the knot. The effective radius of the bright knot is 0.022'' or 130 h$^{-1}$$_{50}$ pc. The extended patch is partially resolved into compact regions of star formation. The reconstructed galaxy has I$_{AB}$ = 24, giving a bolometric luminosity of about 3 {\times} 10$^{11}$ L$_{solar}$. This can be produced by a star formation rate of 36 h$^{-2}$$_{50}$ M$_{solar}$ yr$^{-1}$ (q$_{0}$ = 0.5) or by an instantaneous starburst of 3 {\times} 10$^{8}$ M$_{solar}$. The spectral lines show velocity variations on the order of 300 km s$^{-1}$ along the arc. The Si II line is blueshifted with respect to the Ly{$\alpha$} emission, and the Ly{$\alpha$} emission line is asymmetric with a red tail. These spectral features are naturally explained by an outflow model, in which the blue side of the Ly{$\alpha$} line has been absorbed by outflowing neutral H I. Evidence from other sources indicates that outflows are common in starburst galaxies at high and low redshift. We have discovered a companion galaxy with a radial velocity only 450 km s$^{-1}$ different than that of the arc. The serendipitous discovery of these two galaxies suggests that systematic searches may uncover galaxies at even higher redshifts.

  abstract = {We present the first results from a program of near-infrared spectroscopy aimed at studying the familiar rest-frame optical emission lines from the H II regions of Lyman break galaxies at z \~{}= 3. By targeting redshifts that bring the lines of interest into gaps between the strong OH sky emission, we have been successful in detecting Balmer and [O III] emission lines in all five galaxies observed so far with CGS4 on UKIRT. The typical line fluxes are a few times 10$^{-17}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, approximately 1 order of magnitude lower than the limits reached with wide-field narrowband imaging surveys. For a Salpeter initial mass function and a H$_{0}$ = 70 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, q$_{0}$ = 0.1 cosmology, the H{$\beta$} luminosities uncorrected for dust extinction imply star formation rates of 20-270 M$_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$ these values are greater than those that may have been deduced from the ultraviolet continuum luminosities at 1500 {\AA} by factors of between \~{}0.7 and \~{}7. Uncertainties in the shape of the reddening curve and in the intrinsic UV continuum slope do not yet allow us to assess accurately the level of dust extinction; however, on the basis of the present limited sample, it appears that an extinction of 1-2 mag at 1500 {\AA} may be typical of Lyman break galaxies. This value is consistent with recent estimates of dust obscuration in star-forming galaxies at z $\lt$= 1 and does not require a substantial revision of the broad picture of star formation over the Hubble time proposed by Madau and coworkers in 1996. In four out of five cases the velocity dispersion of the emission line gas is {$\sigma$} \~{}= 70 km s$^{-1}$, while in the fifth the line widths are nearly three times larger. Virial masses M$_{vir}$ \~{} (1-5) {\times} 10$^{10}$ M$_{⊙}$ are suggested, but both velocities and masses could be higher, because our observations are only sensitive to the brightest cores of these systems where the line widths may not sample the full gravitational potential. The relative redshifts of interstellar absorption, nebular emission, and Ly{$\alpha$} emission lines differ by several hundred km s$^{-1}$ and suggest that large-scale outflows may be a common characteristic of Lyman break galaxies. The forthcoming availability of high-resolution infrared spectrographs on large telescopes will soon allow all of these questions to be addressed in much greater detail.},

Line profiles of H{$\alpha$}, [N II], [S II], [O I], H{$\beta$}, and [O III] are resolved and fit jointly with common velocity components. Diagnostic ratios of these line fluxes are presented in a series of plots, showing how the Doppler shift, line width, gas excitation, and surface brightness change with velocity at fixed position and also with distance from the nucleus. One general characteristic of these spectra is the presence of shocked gas extending many kiloparsecs from the nucleus. In some systems, the rotation curves of the emitting gas indicate motions that suggest gas disks, which are most frequent at early merger stages. At these early merger stages, the emission line ratios indicate the presence of shocked gas, which may be triggered by the merger event. We also report the general characteristics of the integrated spectra.  The data presented herein were obtained at the W. M.

  abstract      = {We present the Spectroscopic Imaging survey in the near-infrared (near-IR) with SINFONI (SINS) of high-redshift galaxies. With 80 objects observed and 63 detected in at least one rest-frame optical nebular emission line, mainly H{$\alpha$}, SINS represents the largest survey of spatially resolved gas kinematics, morphologies, and physical properties of star-forming galaxies at z \~{} 1-3. We describe the selection of the targets, the observations, and the data reduction. We then focus on the ``SINS H{$\alpha$} sample,'' consisting of 62 rest-UV/optically selected sources at 1.3 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2.6 for which we targeted primarily the H{$\alpha$} and [N II] emission lines. Only {\ap}30\% of this sample had previous near-IR spectroscopic observations. The galaxies were drawn from various imaging surveys with different photometric criteria; as a whole, the SINS H{$\alpha$} sample covers a reasonable representation of massive M $_{sstarf}$ gsim 10$^{10}$ M $_{sun}$star-forming galaxies at z {\ap} 1.5-2.5, with some bias toward bluer systems compared to pure K-selected samples due to the requirement of secure optical redshift. The sample spans 2 orders of magnitude in stellar mass and in absolute and specific star formation rates, with median values {\ap}3 {\times} 10$^{10}$ M $_{sun}$, {\ap}70 M $_{sun}$ yr$^{-1}$, and {\ap}3 Gyr$^{-1}$. The ionized gas distribution and kinematics are spatially resolved on scales ranging from {\ap}1.5 kpc for adaptive optics assisted observations to typically {\ap}4-5 kpc for seeing-limited data. The H{$\alpha$} morphologies tend to be irregular and/or clumpy. About one-third of the SINS H{$\alpha$} sample galaxies are rotation-dominated yet turbulent disks, another one-third comprises compact and velocity dispersion-dominated objects, and the remaining galaxies are clear interacting/merging systems; the fraction of rotation-dominated systems increases among the more massive part of the sample. The H{$\alpha$} luminosities and equivalent widths suggest on average roughly twice higher dust attenuation toward the H II regions relative to the bulk of the stars, and comparable current and past-averaged star formation rates.

Observational evidence from IRAS galaxies with IR luminosities of more than 10 exp 12 solar luminosity is reviewed. Specific treatment is given to the spectral energy distribution of Arp 220 when it is extrapolated into the UV. Because giant ellipticals are metal-rich it is assumed that they form from gases as enriched as those in IRAS merger progenitors. The spectral energy distribution of Arp 220 demonstrates the feasibility of detecting dust-shrouded protoellipticals in K- and V-band surveys. The present investigation suggests that ellipticals formed at high redshifts of more than 10 and that most galaxy formation can occur in events that are neither peculiar nor prominent.},

The trigger for the intense infrared emission appears to be the strong interaction/merger of molecular gas-rich spirals, and the bulk of the infrared luminosity for all but the most luminous objects is due to dust heating from an intense starburst within giant molecular clouds. At the highest luminosities (Lir $\{$greater than$\}$ 1012 luminosity of sun ), nearly all objects appear to be advanced mergers powered by a mixture of circumnuclear starburst and active galactic nucleus energy sources, both of which are fueled by an enormous concentration of molecular gas that has been funneled into the merger nucleus. These ultraluminous infrared galaxies may represent an important stage in the formation of quasi-stellar objects and powerful radio galaxies. They may also represent a primary stage in the formation of elliptical galaxy cores, the formation of globular clusters, and the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium.},

Our deep VLA 1.4 GHz maps allow us to identify radio counterparts or place stringent limits ($\lt$\~{}20 {$\mu$}Jy in the source plane) on the radio flux of the submm sources. We compare the spectral indices of our sources between 850 {$\mu$}m and 1.4 GHz to empirical and theoretical models for distant starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) as a function of redshift. In this way we can derive redshift limits for the submm sources, even in the absence of an optical or near-infrared counterpart. We conclude that the submm population brighter than \~{}1 mJy has a median redshift of at least \~{}2, more probably \~{}2.5-3, with almost all galaxies at z$\gt$$\gt$1. This estimate is a strong lower limit as both misidentification of the radio counterparts and nonthermal emission from an AGN will bias our redshift estimates to lower values. The high median redshift means that the submm population, if predominately powered by starbursts, contributes a substantial fraction of the total star formation density at high redshifts. A comparison of the spectral index limits with spectroscopic redshifts for proposed optical counterparts to individual submm galaxies suggests that half of the submm sources remain unidentified and thus their counterparts must be fainter than I$\gt$\~{}24.},

  abstract = {Optical surveys of the global star-formation rate in high-redshift galaxies show a strong peak in activity at a redshift of z \~{} 1.5, which implies that most of the star formation has already been seen. High-redshift galaxies may, however, emit most of their energy at submillimetre wavelengths, if they contain substantial amounts of dust that absorbs the starlight and reradiates it as far-infrared light. Here we report a deep survey of a blank region of sky, performed at submillimetre wavelengths (450 and 850{$\mu$}m). We detect luminous sources in the 850-{$\mu$}m band which, if they have similar spectra to low-redshift ultraluminous infrared galaxies and are primarily powered by star formation, must each be converting more than 100 solar masses of gas per year into stars: this is larger than themaximum star-formation rates inferred for most optically selected galaxies. The total amount of star formation at high redshifts is essentially fixed by the level of background light, but where the peak activity occurs at submillimetre wavelengths is not yet well established. However, the background light inferred from the sources that we have detected is already comparable to that from the optically selected sources. Establishing the main epoch of star formation will therefore require a combination of optical and submillimetre studies.},

Observations were taken with the Keck I Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer and the Keck II DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph. Precise astrometry, needed for spectroscopic follow-up, is determined by identification of counterparts at 24 {$\mu$}m or 1.4 GHz using a cross-identification likelihood matching method. Individual source luminosities range from log (L $_{IR}$/L $_{⊙}$) = 12.5-13.6 (corresponding to star formation rates (SFRs) 500-9000 M $_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$, assuming a Salpeter initial mass function), constituting some of the most intrinsically luminous, distant infrared galaxies discovered thus far. We present both individual and composite rest-frame ultraviolet spectra and infrared spectral energy distributions. The selection of these HSGs is reproducible and well characterized across large areas of the sky in contrast to most z $\gt$ 2 HyLIRGs in the literature, which are detected serendipitously or via tailored surveys searching only for high-z HyLIRGs; therefore, we can place lower limits on the contribution of HSGs to the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) at (7 {\plusmn} 2) {\times} 10$^{-3}$  M $_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$ h $^{3}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ at z \~{} 2.5, which is $\gt$10\% of the estimated total SFRD of the universe from optical surveys.

  abstract      = {Three billion years after the big bang (at redshift z = 2), half of the most massive galaxies were already old, quiescent systems with little to no residual star formation and extremely compact with stellar mass densities at least an order of magnitude larger than in low-redshift ellipticals, their descendants. Little is known about how they formed, but their evolved, dense stellar populations suggest formation within intense, compact starbursts 1-2 Gyr earlier (at 3 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 6). Simulations show that gas-rich major mergers can give rise to such starbursts, which produce dense remnants. Submillimeter-selected galaxies (SMGs) are prime examples of intense, gas-rich starbursts. With a new, representative spectroscopic sample of compact, quiescent galaxies at z = 2 and a statistically well-understood sample of SMGs, we show that z = 3-6 SMGs are consistent with being the progenitors of z = 2 quiescent galaxies, matching their formation redshifts and their distributions of sizes, stellar masses, and internal velocities. Assuming an evolutionary connection, their space densities also match if the mean duty cycle of SMG starbursts is 42\^{}$\{$+40$\}$\_$\{$-29$\}$ Myr (consistent with independent estimates), which indicates that the bulk of stars in these massive galaxies were formed in a major, early surge of star formation. These results suggest a coherent picture of the formation history of the most massive galaxies in the universe, from their initial burst of violent star formation through their appearance as high stellar-density galaxy cores and to their ultimate fate as giant ellipticals.},

  abstract      = {We present high-resolution (0.''3) Atacama Large Millimeter Array 870 {$\mu$}m imaging of 52 sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the Ultra Deep Survey field to investigate the size and morphology of the sub-millimeter (sub-mm) emission on 2-10 kpc scales. We derive a median intrinsic angular size of FWHM = 0.''30 {\plusmn} 0.''04 for the 23 SMGs in the sample detected at a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) $\gt$10. Using the photometric redshifts of the SMGs we show that this corresponds to a median physical half-light diameter of 2.4 {\plusmn} 0.2 kpc. A stacking analysis of the SMGs detected at S/N $\lt$10 shows they have sizes consistent with the 870 {$\mu$}m bright SMGs in the sample. We compare our results to the sizes of SMGs derived from other multi-wavelength studies, and show that the rest-frame \~{}250 {$\mu$}m sizes of SMGs are consistent with studies of resolved $^{12}$CO (J = 3-2 to 7-6) emission lines, but that sizes derived from 1.4 GHz imaging appear to be approximately two times larger on average, which we attribute to cosmic ray diffusion. The rest-frame optical sizes of SMGs are around four times larger than the sub-millimeter sizes, indicating that the star formation in these galaxies is compact relative to the pre-existing stellar distribution. The size of the starburst region in SMGs is consistent with the majority of the star formation occurring in a central region, a few kiloparsecs in extent, with a median star formation rate surface density of 90 {\plusmn} 30 M $_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$, which may suggest that we are witnessing an intense period of bulge growth in these galaxies.},

  abstract      = {In order to find the most extreme dust-hidden high-redshift galaxies, we select 196 extremely red objects in the K$_{S}$ and Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) bands (KIEROs, [K$_{s}$ - 4.5 {$\mu$}m]$_{AB}$ $\gt$ 1.6) in the 0.06 deg$^{2}$ Great Observatories Origins Deep Surveys-North (GOODS-N) region. This selection avoids the Balmer breaks of galactic spectra at z $\lt$ 4 and picks up red galaxies with strong dust extinction. The photometric redshifts of KIEROs are between 1.5 and 5, with \~{}70\% at z \~{} 2-4. KIEROs are very massive, with M $_{sstarf}$ \~{} 10$^{10}$-10$^{12}$ M $_{⊙}$. They are optically faint and usually cannot be picked out by the Lyman break selection. On the other hand, the KIERO selection includes approximately half of the known millimeter and submillimeter galaxies in the GOODS-N. Stacking analyses in the radio, millimeter, and submillimeter all show that KIEROs are much more luminous than average 4.5 {$\mu$}m-selected galaxies. Interestingly, the stacked fluxes for Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS)-undetected KIEROs in these wave bands are 2.5-5 times larger than those for ACS-detected KIEROs. With the stacked radio fluxes and the local radio-FIR correlation, we derive mean infrared luminosities of (2-7) {\times} 10$^{12}$ L $_{⊙}$ and mean star formation rates (SFRs) of 400-1200 M $_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$ for KIEROs with redshifts. We do not find evidence of a significant subpopulation of passive KIEROs. The large stellar masses and SFRs imply that KIEROs are z $\gt$ 2 massive galaxies in rapid formation. Our results show that a large sample of dusty ultraluminous sources can be selected in this way and that a large fraction of high-redshift star formation is hidden by dust.

One of our objects is detected on the PdBI map with a 4.3{$\sigma$} significance, corresponding to S\_$\backslash$nu (1.1 $\backslash$, mm)=0.78 +/- 0.18 $\backslash$, mJy. By combining this detection with the Spitzer 8 and 24 {$\mu$}m photometry for this source, and SCUBA2 flux density upper limits, we infer that this galaxy is a composite active galactic nucleus/star-forming system. The infrared (IR)-derived star formation rate is SFR {\ap} 200 {\plusmn} 100 M $_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$, which implies that this galaxy is a higher-redshift analogue of the ordinary ultra-luminous infrared galaxies more commonly found at z \~{} 2-3. In the field of the other target, we find a tentative 3.1{$\sigma$} detection on the PdBI 1.1 mm map, but 3.7 arcsec away of our target position, so it likely corresponds to a different object. In spite of the lower significance, the PdBI detection is supported by a close SCUBA2 3.3{$\sigma$} detection. No counterpart is found on either the deep SEDS or CANDELS maps, so, if real, the PdBI source could be similar in nature to the submillimeter source GN10. We conclude that the analysis of ultra-deep near- and mid-IR images offers an efficient, alternative route to discover new sites of powerful star formation activity at high redshifts.},

  abstract      = {Massive present-day early-type (elliptical and lenticular) galaxies probably gained the bulk of their stellar mass and heavy elements through intense, dust-enshrouded starbursts--that is, increased rates of star formation--in the most massive dark-matter haloes at early epochs. However, it remains unknown how soon after the Big Bang massive starburst progenitors exist. The measured redshift (z) distribution of dusty, massive starbursts has long been suspected to be biased low in z owing to selection effects, as confirmed by recent findings of systems with redshifts as high as \~{}5 (refs 2-4). Here we report the identification of a massive starburst galaxy at z = 6.34 through a submillimetre colour-selection technique. We unambiguously determined the redshift from a suite of molecular and atomic fine-structure cooling lines. These measurements reveal a hundred billion solar masses of highly excited, chemically evolved interstellar medium in this galaxy, which constitutes at least 40 per cent of the baryonic mass. A `maximum starburst' converts the gas into stars at a rate more than 2,000 times that of the Milky Way, a rate among the highest observed at any epoch. Despite the overall downturn in cosmic star formation towards the highest redshifts, it seems that environments mature enough to form the most massive, intense starbursts existed at least as early as 880 million years after the Big Bang.},

  abstract      = {The Hubble Deep Field provides one of the deepest multiwavelength views of the distant Universe and has led to the detection of thousands of galaxies seen throughout cosmic time. An early map of the Hubble Deep Field at a wavelength of 850 micrometres, which is sensitive to dust emission powered by star formation, revealed the brightest source in the field, dubbed HDF 850.1 (ref. 2). For more than a decade, and despite significant efforts, no counterpart was found at shorter wavelengths, and it was not possible to determine its redshift, size or mass. Here we report a redshift of z = 5.183 for HDF 850.1, from a millimetre-wave molecular line scan. This places HDF 850.1 in a galaxy overdensity at z \~{} 5.2, corresponding to a cosmic age of only 1.1 billion years after the Big Bang. This redshift is significantly higher than earlier estimates and higher than those of most of the hundreds of submillimetre-bright galaxies identified so far. The source has a star-formation rate of 850 solar masses per year and is spatially resolved on scales of 5 kiloparsecs, with an implied dynamical mass of about 1.3 {\times} 10$^{11}$ solar masses, a significant fraction of which is present in the form of molecular gas.

  abstract      = {We derive physical properties of 10 submillimeter galaxies located in the CANDELS coverage of the GOODS-S field. The galaxies were first identified as submillimeter sources with the LABOCA bolometer and subsequently targeted for 870 {$\mu$}m continuum observation with ALMA. The high angular resolution of the ALMA imaging allows secure counterparts to be identified in the CANDELS multiband data set. The CANDELS data provide deep photometric data from UV through near-infrared wavelengths. Using synthetic spectral energy distributions, we derive photometric redshifts, stellar masses, extinction, ages, and the star formation history. The redshift range is z = 1.65-4.76, with two of the galaxies located at z $\gt$ 4. Two submillimeter galaxy (SMG) counterparts have stellar masses 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than the rest. The remaining SMG counterparts have stellar masses around 1 {\times} 10$^{11}$ M $_{⊙}$. The stellar population in the SMGs is typically older than the expected duration of the submillimeter phase, suggesting that the star formation history of SMGs is more complex than a single burst. Non-parametric morphology indices suggest that the SMG counterparts are among the most asymmetric systems compared with galaxies of the same stellar mass and redshift. The Hubble Space Telescope images show that three of the SMGs are associated with ongoing mergers. The remaining counterparts are isolated. Estimating the dust and molecular gas mass from the submillimeter fluxes, and comparing with our stellar masses shows that the gas mass fraction of SMGs is \~{}28\% and that the final stellar mass is likely to be \~{}(1-2) {\times} 10$^{11}$ M $_{⊙}$.},

  abstract      = {We compare various star formation rate (SFR) indicators for star-forming galaxies at 1.4 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2.5 in the COSMOS field. The main focus is on the SFRs from the far-IR (PACS-Herschel data) with those from the ultraviolet, for galaxies selected according to the BzK criterion. FIR-selected samples lead to a vastly different slope of the SFR-stellar mass (M$_{*}$) relation, compared to that of the dominant main-sequence population as measured from the UV, since the FIR selection picks predominantly only a minority of outliers. However, there is overall agreement between the main sequences derived with the two SFR indicators, when stacking on the PACS maps the BzK-selected galaxies. The resulting logarithmic slope of the SFR-M$_{*}$ relation is {\tilde}0.8-0.9, in agreement with that derived from the dust-corrected UV luminosity. Exploiting deeper 24 {$\mu$}m Spitzer data, we have characterized a subsample of galaxies with reddening and SFRs poorly constrained, as they are very faint in the B band. The combination of Herschel with Spitzer data has allowed us to largely break the age/reddening degeneracy for these intriguing sources, by distinguishing whether a galaxy is very red in B-z because of being heavily dust reddened, or whether because star formation has been (or is being) quenched. Finally, we have compared our SFR(UV) to the SFRs derived by stacking the radio data and to those derived from the H{$\alpha$} luminosity of a sample of star-forming galaxies at 1.4 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1.7. The two sets of SFRs are broadly consistent as they are with the SFRs derived from the UV and by stacking the corresponding PACS data in various mass bins.},

Our simulations include primordial radiative cooling, photoionization, star formation, supernova II feedback, but exclude supernova-driven winds and active galactic nucleus feedback. The simulated galaxies assemble in two phases, with the initial growth dominated by compact (r $\lt$ r $_{eff}$) in situ star formation fueled by cold, low-entropy gas streams resulting in a very similar mean assembly redshift of z $_{f, ins}$ \~{} 2.5 for the in situ stellar component in all galaxies. The late growth is dominated by accretion of old stars formed in subunits outside the main galaxy (r $\gt$ r $_{eff}$) resulting in an assembly redshift of z $_{f, acc}$ \~{} 0.5-1.5 with much larger scatter. We find a positive correlation between the fraction of accreted stars and the final mass of our galaxies. We show that gravitational feedback strongly suppresses late star formation in massive galaxies contributing to the observed galaxy color bimodality. The accretion of stellar material is also responsible for the observed size growth of early-type galaxies. In addition, we find that the dark matter fractions within the stellar half-mass radii continuously increase toward lower redshift from about f $_{DM}$ \~{} 0.05 at z \~{} 3 to f $_{DM}$ \~{} 0.1-0.3 at z = 0. Furthermore, the logarithmic slope of the total density profile is nearly isothermal at the present day ({$\gamma$}' \~{} 1.9-2.2). Finally, the input of gravitational heating lowers the central dark matter densities in the galaxies, with the effect being smaller compared to simulations without supernova feedback.},

  abstract = {New CO interferometer data show that the molecular gas in infrared ultraluminous galaxies is in rotating nuclear disks or rings. The CO maps yield disk radii, kinematic major axes, rotation speeds, enclosed dynamical masses, and gas masses. The CO brightness temperatures, the double-peaked CO line profiles, the limits on thermal continuum flux from dust, and the constraint that the gas mass must be less than the dynamical mass all indicate that the CO lines are subthermally excited and moderately opaque ({$\tau$} = 4 to 10). We fit kinematic models in which most of the CO flux comes from a moderate-density warm intercloud medium, rather than from self-gravitating clouds. Typical ring radii are 300 to 800 pc. We derive gas masses not from a standard CO-to-mass ratio, but from a model of radiative transfer through subthermally excited CO in the molecular disks. This model yields gas masses of \~{}5 {\times} 10$^{9}$ M$_{⊙}$, \~{}5 times lower than the standard method, and a ratio M$_{gas}$/L$^{'}$$_{CO}$\~{}0.8 M$_{⊙}$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{2}$)$^{-1}$. In the nuclear disks, we derive a ratio of gas to dynamical mass of M$_{gas}$/M$_{dyn}$ \~{} 1/6, and a maximum ratio of gas to total mass surface density, {$\mu$}/{$\mu$}$_{tot}$, of 1/3. For the galaxies VII Zw 31, Arp 193, and IRAS 10565+2448, the CO position-velocity diagrams provide good evidence for rotating molecular rings with a central gap. In addition to the rotating central rings or disks, a new class of star formation region is identified, which we call an extreme starburst. These have a characteristic sizes of only 100 pc, with about 10$^{9}$ M$_{⊙}$ of gas and an IR luminosity of \~{}3 {\times} 10$^{11}$ L$_{⊙}$ from recently formed OB stars. Four extreme starbursts are identified in the 3 closest galaxies in the sample, including Arp 220, Arp 193, and Mrk 273. These are the most prodigious star formation events in the local universe, each representing about 1000 times as many OB stars as 30 Doradus. In Mrk 231, the CO (2-1) velocity diagram along the line of nodes shows a 1.2`` diameter inner disk and a 3'' diameter outer disk. The narrow CO line width, the single-peak line profile, the equality of the major and minor axes, and the observed velocity gradients all imply that the molecular disk is nearly face-on, yielding low optical and UV extinction to the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Such a geometry means that the molecular disk cannot be heated by the AGN; the far-infrared (FIR) luminosity of Mrk 231 is powered by a starburst, not the AGN. In Mrk 273, the CO (1-0) maps show long streamers of radius 5 kpc (7``) with velocity gradients north-south, and a nuclear disk of radius 400 pc (0.6'') with velocity gradients east-west. The nuclear disk contains a bright CO core of radius 120 pc (0.2``). In Arp 220, the CO and 1.3 mm continuum maps show the two ``nuclei'' embedded in a central ring or disk at P.A. 50{\deg} and a fainter structure extending 7'' (3 kpc) to the east, normal to the nuclear disk. Models of the CO and dust flux indicate that the two K-band sources contain high-density gas, with n(H$_{2}$) = 2 {\times} 10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$. There is no evidence that these sources really are the premerger nuclei. They are more likely to be compact extreme starburst regions, containing 10$^{9}$ M$_{⊙}$ of dense molecular gas and new stars, but no old stars. Most of the HCN emission arises in the two nuclei. The luminosity-to-mass ratios for the CO sources in Arp 220 are compatible with the early phases of compact starbursts. There is a large mass of molecular gas currently forming stars with plenty of ionizing photons, and no obvious AGN. The entire bolometric luminosity of Arp 220 comes from starbursts, not an AGN. The CO maps show that the gas in ultraluminous IR galaxies is in extended disks that cannot intercept all the power of central AGNs, even if they exist. We conclude that in ultraluminous IR galaxies--even in Mrk 231, which hosts a quasar--the FIR luminosity is powered by extreme starbursts in the molecular rings or disks, not by dust-enshrouded quasars.},

The SEDs are fitted to {$\tau$}-models with a range of metallicities, dust laws, and different stellar population synthesis codes. These models indicate masses equal to, or slightly smaller than, our default masses. The maximum difference is 0.16 dex for each parameter considered, and only 0.18 dex for the most extreme combination of parameters. Two-component populations with a maximally old stellar population superposed with a young component provide reasonable fits to these SEDs using the models of Bruzual {\amp} Charlot; however, when using models with updated treatment of TP-AGB stars, the fits are poorer. The two-component models predict masses that are 0.08-0.22 dex larger than the {$\tau$}-models. We also test the effect of a bottom-light initial mass function (IMF) and find that it would reduce the masses of these galaxies by 0.3 dex. Considering the range of allowable masses from the {$\tau$}-models, two-component fits, and IMF, we conclude that on average these galaxies lie below the mass-size relation of galaxies in the local universe by a factor of 3-9, depending on the SED models used.},

This is supplemented by kinematic data from 43 z \~{} 1-2.5 galaxies from the literature. None of these 81 galaxies is an obvious major merger. We find that the kinematic classification of high-z SFGs as ``dispersion dominated'' or ``rotation dominated'' correlates most strongly with their intrinsic sizes. Smaller galaxies are more likely ``dispersion-dominated'' for two main reasons: (1) the rotation velocity scales linearly with galaxy size but intrinsic velocity dispersion does not depend on size or may even increase in smaller galaxies, and as such, their ratio is systematically lower for smaller galaxies, and (2) beam smearing strongly decreases large-scale velocity gradients and increases observed dispersion much more for galaxies with sizes at or below the resolution. Dispersion-dominated SFGs may thus have intrinsic properties similar to ``rotation-dominated'' SFGs, but are primarily more compact, lower mass, less metal enriched, and may have higher gas fractions, plausibly because they represent an earlier evolutionary state.

  abstract      = {We present very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of 179 radio sources in the COSMOS field with extremely high sensitivity using the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) together with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) (VLBA+GBT) at 1.4 GHz, to explore the faint radio population in the flux density regime of tens of $\mu$Jy. Here, the identification of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is based on the VLBI detection of the source, i.e., it is independent of X-ray or infrared properties. The milli-arcsecond resolution provided by the VLBI technique implies that the detected sources must be compact and have large brightness temperatures, and therefore they are most likely AGN (when the host galaxy is located at z$\geq$0.1). On the other hand, this technique allows us to only positively identify when a radio-active AGN is present, i.e., we cannot affirm that there is no AGN when the source is not detected. For this reason, the number of identified AGN using VLBI should be always treated as a lower limit. We present a catalogue containing the 35 radio sources detected with the VLBA+GBT, 10 of which were not previously detected using only the VLBA. We have constructed the radio source counts at 1.4 GHz using the samples of the VLBA and VLBA+GBT detected sources of the COSMOS field to determine a lower limit for the AGN contribution to the faint radio source population. We found an AGN contribution of $\gt$40-75\% at flux density levels between 150 $\mu$Jy and 1 mJy. This flux density range is characterised by the upturn of the Euclidean-normalised radio source counts, which implies a contribution of a new population. This result supports the idea that the sub-mJy radio population is composed of a significant fraction of radio-emitting AGN, rather than solely by star-forming galaxies, in agreement with previous studies.},

We carry out a comparative study of the bulge and global properties of a sample of spiral and S0 galaxies in a fixed environment. Our sample is flux limited and contains 262 spiral and 155 S0 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We have classified bulges into classical and pseudobulge categories based on their position on the Kormendy diagram. Dividing our sample into bins of galaxy stellar mass, we find that the fraction of S0 galaxies hosting a classical bulge is significantly higher than the classical bulge fraction seen in spirals even at fixed stellar mass. We have compared the bulge and the global properties of spirals and S0 galaxies in our sample and find indications that spiral galaxies which host a classical bulge, preferentially get converted into S0 population as compared to pseudobulge hosting spirals. By studying the star formation properties of our galaxies in the NUV-r color-mass diagram, we find that the pseudobulge hosting spirals are mostly star forming while the majority of classical bulge host spirals are in the green valley or in the passive sequence. We suggest that some internal process, such as AGN feedback or morphological quenching due to the massive bulge, quenches these classical bulge hosting spirals and transforms them into S0 galaxies, thus resulting in the observed predominance of the classical bulge in S0 galaxies.},

The target has a high stellar mass and a molecular gas fraction of \~{}30\% -- unusually high for its low star formation rate. We look for indicators of star formation suppression mechanisms in the stellar kinematics and age distribution of the galaxy obtained from spatially resolved Gemini Integral-Field spectra and in the gas kinematics obtained from ALMA. We find evidence of significant rotation in the stars, but we do not detect a stellar age gradient within 5 kpc. The molecular gas is aligned with the stellar component, and we see no evidence of strong gas outflows. Our target may represent the product of a merger-induced starburst or of morphological quenching; however, our results are not completely consistent with any of the prominent quenching models.},

  abstract      = {A large fraction of early-type galaxies (ETGs) host prominent dust features, and central dust rings are arguably the most interesting among them. We present here `Lord Of The Rings' (LOTR), a new methodology which allows to integrate the extinction by dust rings in a 2D fitting modelling of the surface brightness distribution. Our pipeline acts in two steps, first using the surface fitting software GALFIT to determine the unabsorbed stellar emission, and then adopting the radiative transfer code SKIRT to apply dust extinction. We apply our technique to NGC 4552 and NGC 4494, two nearby ETGs. We show that the extinction by a dust ring can mimic, in a surface brightness profile, a central point source (e.g. an unresolved nuclear stellar cluster or an active galactic nucleus; AGN) superimposed to a `core' (i.e. a central flattening of the stellar light commonly observed in massive ETGs). We discuss how properly accounting for dust features is of paramount importance to derive correct fluxes especially for low luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs). We suggest that the geometries of dust features are strictly connected with how relaxed is the gravitational potential, i.e. with the evolutionary stage of the host galaxy. Additionally, we find hints that the dust mass contained in the ring relates to the AGN activity.},

Scenarios involving a Solar System object, a stellar cluster, dust enshrouding, and accretion variability have been considered, and discarded, as the origin of the transient. Although a combination of time-varying strong and weak lensing effects, induced by an intermediate mass black hole (10$^4$ - 5 $\times$ 10$^{5}$ M$\_{\odot}$) moving within the Milky Way halo (0.1 -- 4 kpc), can conceivably explain all of the observed variable galaxy properties, it is statistically highly unlikely according to current theoretical predictions, and, therefore, also discarded. A cataclysmic event such as a supernova/hypernova could have occurred, as long as the event was observed towards the later/late-stage descent of the light curve, but this scenario fails to explain the absence of a post-explosion source and/or host HII region in recent optical images. An episode related to the giant eruption of a luminous blue variable star, a stellar merger or a nova, observed at, or near, peak magnitude may explain the transient source and possibly the change in morphology/center of brightness, but can not justify the main source peak variability, unless stellar variability is evoked.},

By constructing samples of low-redshift galaxies for which the stellar mass ($\mathrm{M}\_{*}$), star formation rate (SFR) and specific star formation rate (sSFR) are matched to the high-redshift sample we remove the effects of an evolution in these properties. We also account for the effect of metallicity by jointly constraining the metallicity and ionisation parameter of each sample. We find an evolution in the ionisation parameter for main-sequence, star-forming galaxies and show that this evolution is driven by the evolution of sSFR. By analysing the matched samples as well as a larger sample of $z\lt0.3$, star-forming galaxies we show that high ionisation parameters are directly linked to high sSFRs and are not simply the byproduct of an evolution in metallicity. Our results are physically consistent with the definition of the ionisation parameter, a measure of the hydrogen ionising photon flux relative to the number density of hydrogen atoms.},

In combination with the GMRT $595-629$ MHz and VLA $2-4$ GHz data, we characterised the spectral and polarimetric properties of the radio emission. The spectral indices for the relics steepen from their outer edges towards the cluster centre and the electric field vectors are approximately perpendicular to the major axes of the relics. The results are consistent with the picture that these relics trace large-scale shocks propagating outwards during the merger. Assuming diffusive shock acceleration (DSA), we obtain shock Mach numbers of $\mathcal{M}=2.4$ and $2.3$ for the northern and southern shocks, respectively. For $\mathcal{M}\lesssim3$ shocks, a pre-existing population of mildly relativistic electrons is required to explain the brightness of the relics due to the high ($\gt10$ per cent) particle acceleration efficiency required. However, for $\mathcal{M}\gtrsim4$ shocks the required efficiency is $\gtrsim1\\%$ and $\gtrsim0.5\\%$, respectively, which is low enough for shock acceleration directly from the thermal pool. We used the fractional polarization to constrain the viewing angle to $\geqslant(53\pm3)^\circ$ and $\geqslant(39\pm5)^\circ$ for the northern and southern shocks, respectively. We found no evidence for diffuse emission in the cluster central region. If the halo spans the entire region between the relics ($\sim1.8\,\text{Mpc}$) our upper limit on the power is $P\_\text{1.4 GHz}=(1.4\pm0.6)\times10^{23}\,\text{W}\text{Hz}^{-1}$ which is approximately equal to the anticipated flux from a cluster of this mass. However, if the halo is smaller than this, our constraints on the power imply that the halo is underluminous.},

The term was coined by Christopher Martin (Caltech), in 2005. Green valley highlights the discriminating power of UV to very low relative levels of ongoing star formation, to which the optical colors, including u-r, are insensitive.  It corresponds to massive galaxies below the star-forming, ``main'' sequence, and therefore represents a critical tool for the study of the quenching of star formation and its possible resurgence in otherwise quiescent galaxies. This article reviews the results pertaining to (predominanlty disk) morphology, structure, environment, dust content and gas properties of green valley galaxies in the local universe. Their relationship to AGN is also discussed. Attention is given to biases emerging from defining the ``green valley'' using optical colors. We review various evolutionary scenarios and we present evidence for a new one, the quasi-static view of the green valley, in which the majority (but not all) of galaxies currently in the green valley were only partially quenched in the distant past and now participate in a slow cosmic decline of star formation, which also drives down the activity on the main sequence, presumably as a result of the dwindling accretion/cooling onto galaxy disks. This emerging synthetic picture is based on the findings from Fang et al. (2012), Salim et al. (2012) and Martin et al. (2007), as well as other results.},

We refer to them as ``Bright, Compact Bulges'' (BCBs) - they resemble neither classical nor pseudo-bulges and constitute $\sim12$\% of the total bulge population at these redshifts. Examining free-bulge $+$ disc decomposition sample and elliptical galaxy sample from Simard et al. (2011), we find that only $\sim0.2$\% of the bulges can be classified as BCBs in the local Universe. Bulge to total ratio $(B/T)$ of disc galaxies with BCBs is (at $\sim0.4$) a factor of $\sim2$ and $\sim4$ larger than for those with classical and pseudo bulges. BCBs are $\sim2.5$ and $\sim6$ times more massive than classical and pseudo bulges. Although disc galaxies with BCBs host the most massive and dominant bulge type, their specific star formation rate is $1.5-2$ times higher than other disc galaxies. This is contrary to the expectations that a massive compact bulge would lead to lower star formation rates. We speculate that our BCB host disc galaxies are descendant of massive, compact and passive elliptical galaxies observed at higher redshifts. Those high redshift ellipticals lack local counterparts and possibly evolved by acquiring a compact disc around them. The overall properties of BCBs supports a picture of galaxy assembly in which younger discs are being accreted around massive pre-existing spheroids.},

  abstract = {Starburst99 is a comprehensive set of model predictions for spectrophotometric and related properties of galaxies with active star formation. The models are an improved and extended version of the data set previously published by Leitherer {\amp} Heckman. We have upgraded our code by implementing the latest set of stellar evolution models of the Geneva group and the model atmosphere grid compiled by Lejeune et al. Several predictions which were not included in the previous publication are shown here for the first time. The models are presented in a homogeneous way for five metallicities between Z=0.040 and 0.001 and three choices of the initial mass function. The age coverage is 10$^{6}$-10$^{9}$ yr. We also show the spectral energy distributions which are used to compute colors and other quantities. The full data set is available for retrieval at a Web site, which allows users to run specific models with nonstandard parameters as well. We also make the source code available to the community.},

  abstract      = {In the cores of some clusters of galaxies the hot intracluster plasma is dense enough that it should cool radiatively in the cluster's lifetime, leading to continuous `cooling flows' of gas sinking towards the cluster centre, yet no such cooling flow has been observed. The low observed star-formation rates and cool gas masses for these `cool-core' clusters suggest that much of the cooling must be offset by feedback to prevent the formation of a runaway cooling flow. Here we report X-ray, optical and infrared observations of the galaxy cluster SPT-CLJ2344-4243 (ref. 11) at redshift z = 0.596. These observations reveal an exceptionally luminous (8.2 {\times} 10$^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$) galaxy cluster that hosts an extremely strong cooling flow (around 3,820 solar masses a year). Further, the central galaxy in this cluster appears to be experiencing a massive starburst (formation of around 740 solar masses a year), which suggests that the feedback source responsible for preventing runaway cooling in nearby cool-core clusters may not yet be fully established in SPT-CLJ2344-4243. This large star-formation rate implies that a significant fraction of the stars in the central galaxy of this cluster may form through accretion of the intracluster medium, rather than (as is currently thought) assembling entirely via mergers.},

The observed luminosity-radius-metallicity relations are found to be produced naturally inside dominant halos, with a mass-radius relation that resembles the predictions of the ``cold'' dark matter cosmological scenario. The critical condition for global gas loss as a result of the first burst of star formation is that the virial velocity be below a critical value on the order of 100 km s$^{-1}$. In any hierarchial scenario for galaxy formation, this condition leads to two distinct classes of galaxies as observed: (1) the diffuse dwarfs which mostly originate from typical density perturbations; and (2) the normal, brighter galaxies which can originate only from the highest density peaks. This provides a statistical biasing mechanism for the preferential formation of bright galaxies in denser regions (clusters and superclusters).},

  abstract    = {We study the structural properties of Low Surface Brightness galaxies (LSB) using a sample of 263 galaxies observed by the Green Bank Telescope (Schneider et al 1992). We perform 2D decompositions of these galaxies in the SDSS $g$, $r$ and $i$ bands using the GALFIT software. Our decomposition reveals that about $60\%$ of these galaxies are bulgeless i.e., their light distributions are well modelled by pure exponential disks. The rest of the galaxies were fitted with two components: a Sersic bulge and an exponential disk. Most of these galaxies have bulge-to-total (B/T) ratio less than 0.1. However, of these 104 galaxies, $20\%$ have $B/T > 0.1$ i.e., hosting significant bulge component and they are more prominent amongst the fainter LSBs. According to $g - r$ colour criteria, most of the LSB galaxies in our sample are blue, with only 7 classified as red LSBs. About $15\%$ of the LSB galaxies (including both blue and red) in our sample host stellar bars. The incidence of bars is more prominent in relatively massive blue LSB galaxies with very high gas fraction. These findings may provide important clues to the formation and evolution of LSB galaxies - in particular on the bar/bulge formation in faint LSB disks.},

  title       = {The Missing Satellites of the Magellanic Clouds? Gaia Proper Motions of the Recently Discovered Ultra-Faint Galaxies},
  abstract    = {According to LCDM theory, hierarchical evolution should occur on all mass scales, implying that satellites of the Milky Way also once had companions. The recent discovery of several ultra-faint dwarf galaxy candidates in close proximity to the Magellanic Clouds provides a unique opportunity to test this theory. Specifically, proper motions provide a stringent test, because material that is associated with the Large Magellanic Cloud prior to infall should retain its direction of orbital angular momentum. We present proper motion measurements for 13 of the 32 newly discovered dwarf galaxy candidates using Gaia data release 2. All 13 also have radial velocity measurements. We compare the measured 3D velocities of these dwarfs to those expected at the corresponding distance and location for the debris of an LMC analog in a numerical simulation. We conclude that 4 of these galaxies (Hor1, Car2, Car3 and Hyd1) have come in with the Magellanic Cloud system, constituting the first confirmation of the type of satellite infall predicted by LCDM. Ret2, Tuc2 and Gru1 have some velocity components that are not consistent within 3 sigma of our predictions and are therefore less favorable. Hyd2 and Dra2 could be associated with the LMC and merit further attention. We rule out Tuc3, Cra2, Tri2 and Aqu2 as potential members. Of the dwarfs without measured PMs, 6 of them are deemed unlikely on the basis of their positions and distances alone which put them too far from the orbital plane expected for LMC debris (Eri2, Ind2, Cet2, Tri2, Cet3 and Vir1). For the remaining sample, we use the simulation to predict proper motions and radial velocities, finding that Phx2 has an overdensity of stars in DR2 consistent with this PM prediction. If its radial velocity is confirmed at $\sim -15$ km s$^{-1}, it is also likely a member.},

  abstract      = {The origin of ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) is not yet clear. One possible formation path of UCDs is the threshing of a nucleated elliptical dwarf galaxy (dE, N), however, it remains unclear how such massive nuclear stellar systems were formed in dwarf galaxies. To better establish the early history of UCDs, we investigate the formation of UCD progenitor clusters from super giant molecular clouds (SGMCs), using hydrodynamical simulations. In this study we focus on SGMCs with masses $10^{7} - 10^{8} \rm M\_{\odot}$ that can form massive star clusters that display physical properties similar to UCDs. We find that the clusters have extended star formation histories with two phases, producing multiple distinct stellar populations, and that the star formation rate is dependent on the feedback effects of SNe and AGB stars. The later generations of stars formed in these clusters are more compact, leading to a clearly nested structure, and these stars will be more He-rich than those of the first generation, leading to a slight colour gradient. The simulated clusters demonstrate scaling relations between $R\_{\rm eff}$ and $M$ and $\sigma\_{v}$ and $M$ consistent with those observed in UCDs and strongly consistent with those of the original SGMC. We discuss whether SGMCs such as these can be formed through merging of self-gravitating molecular clouds in galaxies at high-z.},

For four of these dwarfs our proper motion estimate is the first ever provided. The adopted astrometric data come from the second data release of the Gaia mission. We determine the mean proper motion for each galaxy starting from an initial guess of likely members, based either on radial velocity measurements or using stars on the Horizontal Branch identified in the Gaia (G$\_{BP}$-G$\_{RP}$, G) colour-magnitude diagram in the field of view towards the UFD. We then refine their membership iteratively using both astrometry and photometry. We take into account the full covariance matrix among the astrometric parameters when deriving the mean proper motions for these systems. Our procedure provides mean proper motions with typical uncertainties of $\sim0.07$ mas yr$^{-1}$, even for galaxies without prior spectroscopic information. In the case of Segue 2 we find that using radial velocity members only leads to biased results, presumably because of the small number of stars with measured radial velocities. Our procedure allows to maximize the number of member stars per galaxy regardless of the existence of prior spectroscopic information, and can therefore be applied on any faint or distant stellar system within reach of Gaia.},

  abstract      = {We look into the abundance of Dual AGN (active galaxy nuclei) in the largest volume hydrodynamical simulation from the EAGLE project. We define a Dual AGN as two active black holes with a separation below 30 kpc. We find that only 1 percent of AGN with $L\_{\rm HX}\geq 10^{42}$ erg/s are part of an observable Dual AGN system at $z=0.8-1$. During the evolution of a typical binary black hole system, the rapid variability of the hard X-ray luminosity on Myr time-scales severely limits the detectability of Dual AGN. To quantify this effect, we calculate a probability of detection, $t\_{\rm on}/t\_{\rm 30}$, where $t\_{\rm 30}$ is the time in which the two black holes were separated at distances below 30 pkpc and $t\_{\rm on}$, the time that both AGN are visible (e.g. when both AGN have $L\_{\rm HX}\geq 10^{42}$ erg/s) in this period. We find that the average fraction of visible Dual systems is 3 percent. The visible Dual AGN distribution as a function of black hole separation increases with small separations and it presents a pronounced peak at $20-25$ kpc. This shape can be understood as a result of the rapid orbital decay of the host galaxies after their first encounter. Looking at the merger history of the galaxies hosting a Dual AGN, we find that $75$ percent of the host galaxies have recently undergone or are undergoing a merger with stellar mass ratio $\geq 0.1$. Finally, we find that the fraction of visible Dual AGN with respect to the total AGN increases with redshift as found in observations.},

We probe previously unexplored heliocentric distances of $d<20$~kpc with an extreme-deconvolution (XD) technique.

We estimate our detection limits by applying the XD method to mock data, obtaining a conservative limit on the stellar mass of $M_* < 10^4$~M$_{\sun}$ for $d < 20$\, kpc. Such a low stellar mass implies either a low-mass subhalo, or a massive stripped-down subhalo. We use an analytic model for stripped subhalos to argue that, given the sizes and fluxes of the \Fermi-LAT sources, we can reject the hypothesis that they owe to dark matter annihilation.},

  abstract      = {A decade of study has established that the molecular gas properties of star-forming galaxies follow coherent scaling relations out to z\~{}3, suggesting remarkable regularity of the interplay between molecular gas, star formation, and stellar growth. Passive galaxies, however, are expected to be gas-poor and therefore faint, and thus little is known about molecular gas in passive galaxies beyond the local universe. Here we present deep Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of CO(2-1) emission in 8 massive (Mstar \~{} 10\^{}11 Msol) galaxies at z\~{}0.7 selected to lie a factor of 3-10 below the star-forming sequence at this redshift, drawn from the Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) survey. We significantly detect half the sample, finding molecular gas fractions $\lt$\~{}0.1. We show that the molecular and stellar rotational axes are broadly consistent, arguing that the molecular gas was not accreted after the galaxies became quiescent. We find that scaling relations extrapolated from the star-forming population over-predict both the gas fraction and gas depletion time for passive objects, suggesting the existence of either a break or large increase in scatter in these relations at low specific star formation rate. Finally, we show that the gas fractions of the passive galaxies we have observed at intermediate redshifts are naturally consistent with evolution into local massive early-type galaxies by continued low-level star formation, with no need for further gas accretion or dynamical stabilization of the gas reservoirs in the intervening 6 billion years.},

This method provides a higher accuracy of predictions than those which use stellar mass and [OIII]/H$\beta$. First, we use BPT diagrams and various physical parameters to re-classify the galaxies. Next, using confusion matrices, we determine the `correctly' predicted classes as well as confused cases. In this way, we investigate the effect of each parameter in the confusion matrices and rank the physical parameters used in the discrimination of the different classes. We show that in this survey, for example, $\rm{g - r}$ colour can provide the same accuracy as galaxy stellar mass to predict whether or not a galaxy hosts an AGN. Finally, with the same information, we also rank the parameters involved in the discrimination of Seyfert and LINER galaxies.},

The deep exposures allow us to target individual spectra of massive galaxies to F160W=22.5AB. Our fitting approach uses a set of six base models adapted to the redshift and spectral resolution of each observation, and fits the weights of the base models via a MCMC method. The sample comprises a mixed distribution of quiescent (19) and star-forming galaxies (33). Using the cumulative distribution of stellar ages by mass, we define a "quenching timescale" that is found to correlate with stellar mass. The other population parameters, aside from metallicity, do not show such a strong correlation, although all display the characteristic segregation between quiescent and star-forming populations. Radial colour gradients within each galaxy are also explored, finding a wider scatter in the star-forming subsample, but no conclusive trend with respect to the population parameters.

  title       = {Spatially resolved cold molecular outflows in ULIRGs},
  abstract    = {We present new CO(2-1) observations of 3 low-z (~350 Mpc) ULIRG systems (6 nuclei) observed with ALMA at high-spatial resolution (~500 pc). We detect massive cold molecular gas outflows in 5 out of 6 nuclei (0.3-5)x10^8 Msun. These outflows are spatially resolved with deprojected radii of 0.25-1 kpc although high-velocity molecular gas is detected up to ~0.5-1.8 kpc (1-6 kpc deprojected). The mass outflow rates are 12-400 Msun/yr and the inclination corrected average velocity of the outflowing gas 350-550 km/s (v_max = 500-900 km/s). The origin of these outflows can be explained by the nuclear starbursts although the contribution of an obscured AGN can not be completely ruled out. The position angle (PA) of the outflowing gas along the kinematic minor axis of the nuclear molecular disk suggests that the outflow axis is perpendicular to the disk for three of these outflows. Only in one case, the outflow PA is clearly not along the kinematic minor axis. The outflow depletion times are 15-80 Myr which are slightly shorter than the star-formation (SF) depletion times (30-80 Myr). However, we estimate that only 15-30% of the outflowing gas will escape the gravitational potential of the nucleus. The majority of the outflowing gas will return to the disk after 5-10 Myr and become available to form new stars. Therefore, these outflows will not likely quench the nuclear starbursts. These outflows would be consistent with being driven by radiation pressure (momentum-driven) only if the coupling between radiation and dust increases with increasing SF rates. This can be achieved if the dust optical depth is higher in objects with higher SF. The relatively small sizes (<1 kpc) and dynamical times (<3 Myr) of the cold molecular outflows suggests that molecular gas cannot survive longer in the outflow environment or that it cannot form efficiently beyond these distances or times.

We measure redshifts using H$\alpha$ line emission, and find that these galaxies are at comoving distances of ${\approx}25$ and ${\approx}41$ Mpc, respectively, after correcting for the local velocity field. They have effective radii of $r\_\mathrm{eff}=1.2$ and 1.8 kpc and stellar masses of $M\_\star\approx2$-$3\times10^{7}~M\_\odot$. There are no massive galaxies ($M\_\star\gt10^{10} M\_\odot$) within a comoving separation of at least 1.5 Mpc from LSBG-285 and 2 Mpc from LSBG-750. These sources are similar in size and surface brightness to ultra-diffuse galaxies, except they are isolated, star-forming objects that were optically selected in an environmentally blind survey. Both galaxies likely have low stellar metallicities $[Z\_\star/Z\_\odot] \lt -1.0$ and are consistent with the stellar mass-metallicity relation for dwarf galaxies. We set an upper limit on LSBG-750's rotational velocity of ${\sim}50$ km s$^{-1}$, which is comparable to dwarf galaxies of similar stellar mass with estimated halo masses $\lt10^{11}~M\_\odot$. We find tentative evidence that the gas-phase metallicities in both of these diffuse systems are high for their stellar mass, though a statistically complete, optically-selected galaxy sample at very low surface brightness will be necessary to place these results into context with the higher-surface-brightness galaxy population.},

  abstract      = {M85 is a peculiar S0 galaxy in Virgo and is a well-known merger remnant. In this paper, we present the first spectroscopic study of globular clusters (GCs) in M85. We obtain spectra for 21 GC candidates and the nucleus of M85 using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph on the Gemini North 8.1 m telescope. From their radial velocities, 20 of the GCs are found to be members of M85. We find a strong rotation signal of the M85 GC system with a rotation amplitude of 235 km s$^{-1}$. The rotation axis of the GC system has a position angle of about 161$^{\circ}$, which is 51$\rlap{.}{^\circ}$5 larger than that of the stellar light. The rotation-corrected radial velocity dispersion of the GC system is estimated to be $\sigma\_{\rm r,cor} = $ 160 km s$^{-1}$. The rotation parameter $\Omega R\_{\rm icor}/\sigma\_{\rm r,cor}$ of the GC system is derived to be 1.47$^{+1.05}\_{-0.48}$, which is one of the largest among known early-type galaxies. The ages and metallicities of the GCs, which show the same trend as the results based on Lick indices, are derived from full spectrum fitting (ULySS). About a half of the GCs are an intermediate-age population of which the mean age is $\sim$ 3.7 $\pm$ 1.9 Gyr, having a mean [Fe/H] value of --0.26. The other half are old and metal-poor. These results suggest that M85 experienced a wet merging event about 4 Gyr ago, forming a significant population of star clusters. The strong rotational feature of the GC system can be explained by an off-center major merging.},

  abstract      = {Late bloomers are massive ($M\_* \gt 10^{10}\,M\_\odot$) galaxies that formed the majority of their stars within $\sim$2 Gyr of the epoch of observation. Our improved methodology for deriving star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies at redshifts $0.45 \lt z \lt 0.75$ from the Carnegie-Spitzer-IMACS Survey includes confidence intervals that robustly distinguish late bloomers from ``old'' galaxies. We use simulated SFHs to test for ``false positives'' and contamination from old galaxies to demonstrate that the late bloomer population is not an artifact of our template modeling technique. We show that late bloomers account for $\sim$20\% of $z\sim0.6$ galaxies with masses of the modern Milky Way, with a moderate dependence on mass. We take advantage of a 1\% overlap of our sample with HST (CANDELS) imaging to construct a ``gold standard'' catalog of 74 galaxies with high-confidence SFHs, SEDs, basic data, and HST images to facilitate comparison with future studies by others. This small subset suggests that galaxies with both old and young SFHs cover the full range of morphology and environment (excluding rich groups or clusters), albeit with a mild but suggestive correlation with local environment. We begin the investigation of whether late bloomers of sufficient mass and frequency are produced in current-generation $\Lambda$CDM-based semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. In terms of halo growth, we find a late-assembling halo fraction within a factor-of-two of our late bloomer fraction. However, sufficiently delaying star formation in such halos may be a challenge for the baryon component of such models.},

We present a detailed stellar population analysis in the central region of Abell 3827 at $z\sim0.1$, including five-nucleus galaxies involved in a BCG assembly. Based on deep spectroscopy from Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE), we fit the optical spectra of 13 early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the central 70 kpc of the cluster. The stellar populations in the central $R=1$ kpc of these ETGs are old (6-10 Gyr). Their [Fe/H] increases with $\sigma_{\star}$ and stellar mass. More importantly, [$\alpha$/Fe] of galaxies close to the cluster center do not seem to depend on $\sigma_{\star}$ or stellar mass, indicating that the cluster center shapes the [$\alpha$/Fe]-$\sigma_{\star}$ and [$\alpha$/Fe]-$M_{\star}$ relations differently than other environments where [$\alpha$/Fe] is observed to increase with increasing $\sigma_{\star}$ or $M_{\star}$. Our results reveal the coordinated assembly of BCGs: their building blocks are different from the general low mass populations by their high [$\alpha$/Fe]. Massive galaxies thus grow by accreting preferentially high [$\alpha$/Fe] systems. The radial profiles also bear the imprint of the coordinated assembly. Their declining [Fe/H] and flat [$\alpha$/Fe] radial profiles confirm that the accreted systems have low metallicity and high [$\alpha$/Fe] stellar contents.},

Our results confirm one galaxy, BoRG 0116+1425 747, as a highly probable z ~ 8 source, but reveal that BoRG 0116+1425 630 - previously the brightest known z > 8 candidate (mAB = 24.5) - is likely to be a z ~ 2 interloper. As this source was substantially brighter than any other z > 8 candidate, removing it from the sample has a significant impact on the derived UV luminosity function in this epoch. We show that while previous BoRG results favored a shallow power-law decline in the bright end of the luminosity function prior to reionization, there is now no evidence for departure from a Schechter function form and therefore no evidence for a difference in galaxy formation processes before and after reionization.},

  title       = {Suppression of Star Formation in Low-Mass Galaxies Caused by the Reionization of their Local Neighborhood},
  abstract    = {Photoheating associated with reionization suppressed star formation in low-mass galaxies. Reionization was inhomogeneous, however, affecting different regions at different times. To establish the causal connection between reionization and suppression, we must take this local variation into account. We analyze the results of CoDa (`Cosmic Dawn') I, the first fully-coupled radiation-hydrodynamical simulation of reionization and galaxy formation in the Local Universe, in a volume large enough to model reionization globally but with enough resolving power to follow all atomic-cooling galactic halos in that volume. For every halo identified at a given time, we find the redshift at which the surrounding IGM reionized, along with its instantaneous star formation rate (`SFR') and baryonic gas-to-dark matter ratio ($M_\text{gas}/M_\text{DM}$). The average SFR per halo with $M < 10^9 \text{ M}_\odot$ was steady in regions not yet reionized, but declined sharply following local reionization. For $M > 10^{10} \text{ M}_\odot$, this SFR continued through local reionization, increasing with time, instead. For $10^9 < M < 10^{10} \text{ M}_\odot$, the SFR generally increased modestly through reionization, followed by a modest decline. In general, halo SFRs were higher for regions that reionized earlier. A similar pattern was found for $M_\text{gas}/M_\text{DM}$, which declined sharply following local reionization for $M < 10^9 \text{ M}_\odot$. Local reionization time correlates with local matter overdensity, which determines the local rates of structure formation and ionizing photon consumption. The earliest patches to develop structure and reionize ultimately produced more stars than they needed to finish and maintain their own reionization, exporting their `surplus' starlight to help reionize regions that developed structure later.},

  title       = {Multiple populations within globular clusters in Early-type galaxies Exploring their effect on stellar initial mass function estimates},
  abstract    = {It is now well-established that most (if not all) ancient globular clusters host multiple popula- tions, that are characterised by distinct chemical features such as helium abundance variations along with N-C and Na-O anti-correlations, at fixed [Fe/H]. These very distinct chemical fea- tures are similar to what is found in the centres of the massive early-type galaxies and may influence measurements of the global properties of the galaxies. Additionally, recent results have suggested that M/L variations found in the centres of massive early-type galaxies might be due to a bottom-heavy stellar initial mass function. We present an analysis of the effects of globular cluster-like multiple populations on the integrated properties of early-type galaxies. In particular, we focus on spectral features in the integrated optical spectrum and the global mass-to-light ratio that have been used to infer variations in the stellar initial mass function. To achieve this we develop appropriate stellar population synthesis models and take into account, for the first time, an initial-final mass relation which takes into consideration a varying He abundance. We conclude that while the multiple populations may be present in massive early-type galaxies, they are likely not responsible for the observed variations in the mass- to-light ratio and IMF sensitive line strengths. Finally, we estimate the fraction of stars with multiple populations chemistry that come from disrupted globular clusters within massive ellipticals and find that they may explain some of the observed chemical patterns in the centres of these galaxies.},

We point out that, in the inner region of an early type galaxy, the average value of the equation of state $\omega$ determines the power-law index $\gamma$ of the total mass-density profile given by \cite{2006ApJ...649..599K}. We then use 119 galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lensing systems from SLACS, BELLS, BELLS GALLERY and SL2S, to constrain the equation of state $\omega$ for the inner regions of ETGs. We find that the average value of $\omega$ for totally 119 ETGs is $\omega=-0.315\pm0.073$ (68\% CL), which is very close to $-1/3$. If $\omega=-1/3$ is the best value to describe the equation of state of the inner regions of the dark matter in galaxies, the deviation from $-1/3$ could represent the mixture of baryonic matter and dark matter in galaxies.},

The lens redshifts of the sample have a mean value of $0.52$, but the source redshifts span a wide range from $0.8$ to $3.5$, which leads to a wide range of Einstein radii up to three effective radii. We find that: (1) the total mass distribution is very close to isothermal one with the average logarithmic density slope $\langle\gamma\rangle=2.000_{-0.032}^{+0.033}$ ($68\%$CL) and intrinsic scatter $\delta=0.180_{-0.028}^{+0.032}$, similar with previous work. (2) we normalize the Einstein radius by the effective radius to study whether the slope $\gamma$ evolutes along radius for a fixed galaxy. We find the density profile would be steeper with increasing radius. Therefore, We conclude that the total mass-density slope have a slight increasing trend along radius for a fixed galaxy, which is consistent with previous numerical simulation depending on galactic wind and AGN feedback},

  abstract    = {The shape alignment of satellite galaxies around isolated central galaxy has been confirmed by a lot of previous works, both in simulations and observations. While for the shape alignment in a more complex system, such as galaxy pair like our Local group, is poorly studied. In this study, we investigate the shape alignment of satellite galaxies in the system of galaxy pairs similar to Local Group in Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 13 (SDSS DR13). By stacking tens of thousands satellites around galaxy pairs, we found statistically strong signals of tangential alignment of the major axes of the satellites in the facing area (projected areas between two primaries in the sky plane) and radial alignment in the away area (areas in the opposite sides of facing area), at $\sim5\sigma$ levels. Furthermore, the major axes of late-type satellites in facing area show a stronger signal ($\sim27\%$ over the uniform distribution) of tangential alignment, while those of early-type satellites in away area show a stronger signal of radial alignment ($\sim29\%$). The alignment signal increases with the increasing of the brightness of primaries, the decreasing of pair separation or the distance between satellites and their primaries. The alignment signal for galaxy pairs and satellites is found stronger in the large scale filament environments than the alignment signal of those systems not in the filaments, which shows the alignment of the major axes of satellites can be enhanced in the filament environments. These findings will help to understand the mechanisms of how satellites are affected by the tidal force in galaxy pairs. Besides, this statistical alignment signal can be important for the analyses of weak gravitational lensing.},

All galaxies in the present sample have spectroscopic observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic campaigns, generating a sample of 21208 galaxies. Of these galaxies, we identify 214 shell systems and 987 stream systems. For 575 of these systems, we are additionally able to measure the $(g-i)$ colors of the tidal features. We find evidence for star formation in a subset of the streams, with the exception of streams around massive ellipticals, and find that stream host galaxies span the full range of stellar masses in our sample. Galaxies which host shells are predominantly red and massive: we find that observable shells form more frequently around ellipticals than around disc galaxies of the same stellar mass. Although the majority of the shells in our sample are consistent with being formed by minor mergers, $15\% \pm 4.4\%$ of shell host galaxies have $(g-i)$ colors as red as their host galaxy, consistent with being formed by major mergers. These "red shells" are additionally preferentially aligned with the major axis of the host galaxy, as previously predicted from simulations. We suggest that although the bulk of the observable shell population originates from fairly minor mergers, which preferentially form shells that are not aligned with the major axis of the galaxy, major mergers produce a significant number of observable shells.},

  abstract      = {In the cold dark matter cosmology, the baryonic components of galaxies{\mdash}stars and gas{\mdash}are thought to be mixed with and embedded in non-baryonic and non-relativistic dark matter, which dominates the total mass of the galaxy and its dark-matter halo. In the local (low-redshift) Universe, the mass of dark matter within a galactic disk increases with disk radius, becoming appreciable and then dominant in the outer, baryonic regions of the disks of star-forming galaxies. This results in rotation velocities of the visible matter within the disk that are constant or increasing with disk radius{\mdash}a hallmark of the dark-matter model. Comparisons between the dynamical mass, inferred from these velocities in rotational equilibrium, and the sum of the stellar and cold-gas mass at the peak epoch of galaxy formation ten billion years ago, inferred from ancillary data, suggest high baryon fractions in the inner, star-forming regions of the disks. Although this implied baryon fraction may be larger than in the local Universe, the systematic uncertainties (owing to the chosen stellar initial-mass function and the calibration of gas masses) render such comparisons inconclusive in terms of the mass of dark matter. Here we report rotation curves (showing rotation velocity as a function of disk radius) for the outer disks of six massive star-forming galaxies, and find that the rotation velocities are not constant, but decrease with radius. We propose that this trend arises because of a combination of two main factors: first, a large fraction of the massive high-redshift galaxy population was strongly baryon-dominated, with dark matter playing a smaller part than in the local Universe; and second, the large velocity dispersion in high-redshift disks introduces a substantial pressure term that leads to a decrease in rotation velocity with increasing radius. The effect of both factors appears to increase with redshift. Qualitatively, the observations suggest that baryons in the early (high-redshift) Universe efficiently condensed at the centres of dark-matter haloes when gas fractions were high and dark matter was less concentrated.},

  abstract      = {A massive galaxy cluster can serve as a magnifying glass for distant stellar populations, as strong gravitational lensing magnifies background galaxies and exposes details that are otherwise undetectable. In time-domain astronomy, imaging programmes with a short cadence are able to detect rapidly evolving transients, previously unseen by surveys designed for slowly evolving supernovae. Here, we describe two unusual transient events discovered in a Hubble Space Telescope programme that combined these techniques with high-cadence imaging on a field with a strong-lensing galaxy cluster. These transients were faster and fainter than any supernovae, but substantially more luminous than a classical nova. We find that they can be explained as separate eruptions of a luminous blue variable star or a recurrent nova, or as an unrelated pair of stellar microlensing events. To distinguish between these hypotheses will require clarification of the cluster lens models, along with more high-cadence imaging of the field that could detect related transient episodes. This discovery suggests that the intersection of strong lensing with high-cadence transient surveys may be a fruitful path for future astrophysical transient studies.},

  abstract    = {We propose that the Ultra-Diffuse Galaxy (UDG) population represents a set of satellite galaxies born in $\sim10^{10}-10^{11}~{\rm M_\odot}$ halos, similar to field dwarfs, which suffer a dramatic reduction in surface brightness due to tidal stripping and heating. This scenario is observationally motivated by the radial alignment of UDGs in Coma as well as the significant dependence of UDG abundance on cluster mass. As a test of this formation scenario, we apply a semi-analytic model describing the change in stellar mass and half-light radius of dwarf satellites, occupying either cored or cuspy halos, to cluster subhalos in the Bolshoi simulation. Key to this model are results from simulations which indicate that galaxies in cored dark-matter halos expand significantly in response to tidal stripping and heating, whereas galaxies in cuspy halos experience limited size evolution. Our analysis indicates that a population of tidally-stripped dwarf galaxies, residing in cored halos (like that of low-surface brightness field dwarfs), is able to reproduce the observed sizes, stellar masses, and abundance of UDGs in clusters remarkably well.},

  abstract      = {Information on the star-formation histories of cD galaxies and their extended stellar haloes lie in their spectra. Therefore, to determine whether these structures evolved together or through a two-phase formation, we need to spectroscopically separate the light from each component. We present a pilot study to use BUDDI to fit and extract the spectra of the cD galaxy NGC 3311 and its halo in an Integral Field Spectroscopy datacube, and carry out a simple stellar populations analysis to study their star-formation histories. Using MUSE data, we were able to isolate the light of the galaxy and its halo throughout the datacube, giving spectra representing purely the light from each of these structures. The stellar populations analysis of the two components indicates that, in this case, the bulk of the stars in both the halo and the central galaxy are very old, but the halo is more metal poor and less $\alpha$-enriched than the galaxy. This result is consistent with the halo forming through the accretion of much smaller satellite galaxies with more extended star formation. It is noteworthy that the apparent gradients in age and metallicity indicators across the galaxy are entirely consistent with the radially-varying contributions of galaxy and halo components, which individually display no gradients. The success of this study is promising for its application to a larger sample of cD galaxies that are currently being observed by IFU surveys.},

This was the first submillimeter-selected galaxy discovered and remains an archetype of the class, comprising a merger of several massive and active components, including a quasar-luminosity AGN and a highly obscured, gas-rich starburst spread over a \~{}25 kpc extent. The GBT CO(1-0) line profile is comprised of two distinct velocity components separated by about 600 km/s and suggests the presence of a new component of molecular gas that had not been previously identified. The CO(3-2) observations with ALMA show that this new component, designated W1, is associated with a large extended structure stretching 13 kpc westward from the AGN. W1 is not detected in the ALMA CO(7-6) data implying that this gas has much lower CO excitation than the central starburst regions which are bright in CO(7-6). The molecular gas mass of W1 is about 30\% of the total molecular gas mass in the system, depending on the CO--to--H\_2 conversion factor. W1 is arguably a merger remnant; alternatively, it could be a massive molecular outflow associated with the AGN, or perhaps inflowing metal-enriched molecular gas fueling the ongoing activity.},

The sample is composed by 72 objects, whose rotation curves are selected from literature. After a galaxies' division in five velocity bins according to their increasing optical velocity, we observe that in specifically normalized units the rotation curves are all alike in each selected velocity bin, i.e. it reflects the idea of the universal rotation curve (URC) found in Persic et al. From the mass modeling of our galaxies, we show that the dark matter component is dominant rather than the baryonic one, especially within the smallest and less luminous LSB galaxies. The Burkert profile results to be an optimal model fit for the dark matter halos and it is shown that the central surface density $\Sigma \_0 \sim 100 \, M\_{\odot} pc^{-2}$, similar to galaxies of different Hubble types and luminosities. Our analysis leads to a strong correlation between the structural properties of the dark and luminous matter. In particular, when we also evaluate the compactness for stars and dark matter, a strong correlation emerges between the stellar disc and dark matter halo. Finally, the introduction of the stellar compactness $C\_*$ as a new parameter in the ballpark of the luminous matter besides the optical radius and the optical velocity improves the URC.},

The interaction of the two bars, which rotate at distinct speeds, primarily affects the size, strength and pattern speed of the inner bar. When the two bars are perpendicular to each other, the size and the pattern speed of the inner bar decrease and its strength increases. The emergence of a strong Fourier $m=1$ mode increases the oscillation amplitude of the size, strength and pattern speed of the inner bar. On the other hand, the characteristics of the outer bar are substantially influenced by its adjacent spiral structure. When the spiral structure disappears, the size of the outer bar increases and its strength and pattern speed decrease. Consequently, the ratio of the pattern speed of the outer bar with respect to the inner bar is not constant and increases with time. Overall, the double bar and disk system displays substantial high frequency semi-chaotic fluctuations of the pattern strengths and speeds both in space and time, superposed on the slow secular evolution, which invalidates the assumption that the actions of individual stars should be well conserved in barred galaxies, such as the Milky Way.},

  abstract      = {Recent observations have revealed that starburst galaxies can drive molecular gas outflows through stellar radiation pressure. Molecular gas is the phase of the interstellar medium from which stars form, so these outflows curtail stellar mass growth in galaxies. Previously known outflows, however, involve small fractions of the total molecular gas content and are restricted to sub-kiloparsec scales. It is also apparent that input from active galactic nuclei is in at least some cases dynamically important, so pure stellar feedback has been considered incapable of aggressively terminating star formation on galactic scales. Extraplanar molecular gas has been detected in the archetype starburst galaxy M82, but so far there has been no evidence that starbursts can propel significant quantities of cold molecular gas to the same galactocentric radius (\~{}10 kpc) as the warmer gas traced by metal absorbers. Here we report observations of molecular gas in a compact (effective radius 100 pc) massive starburst galaxy at z=0.7, which is known to drive a fast outflow of ionized gas. We find that 35 per cent of the total molecular gas is spatially extended on a scale of approximately 10 kpc, and one third of this has a velocity of up to 1000 km/s. The kinetic energy associated with this high-velocity component is consistent with the momentum flux available from stellar radiation pressure. This result demonstrates that nuclear bursts of star formation are capable of ejecting large amounts of cold gas from the central regions of galaxies, thereby strongly affecting their evolution.},

We start with the standard UVJ-based method to estimate dust extinction and specific star formation rate (sSFR). By replacing J with I band, a new calibration method suitable for use with ACS+WFC3 data is created (I.e. UVI diagram). Using a multi-wavelength multi-aperture photometry catalogue based on CANDELS (Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey), UVI colour profiles of 1328 galaxies are stacked in stellar mass and redshift bins. The resulting colour gradients, covering a radial range of 0.2-2.0 effective radii, increase strongly with galaxy mass and with global A$_{V}$. Colour gradient directions are nearly parallel to the Calzetti extinction vector, indicating that dust plays a more important role than stellar population variations. With our calibration, the resulting A$_{V}$ profiles fall much more slowly than stellar mass profiles over the measured radial range. sSFR gradients are nearly flat without central quenching signatures, except for M$_{⋆}$ $\gt$ 10$^{10.5}$ M$_{⊙}$, where central declines of 20-25 per cent are observed. Both sets of profiles agree well with previous radial sSFR and (continuum) A$_{V}$ measurements. They are also consistent with the sSFR profiles and, if assuming a radially constant gas-to-dust ratio, gas profiles in recent hydrodynamic models. We finally discuss the striking findings that SFR scales with stellar mass density in the inner parts of galaxies, and that dust content is high in the outer parts despite low stellar mass surface densities there.},

We find that the H{$\alpha$} emission broadly follows the rest-frame R-band light but that it is typically somewhat more extended and clumpy. We quantify the spatial distribution with the half-light radius. The median H{$\alpha$} effective radius r$_{e}$ (H{$\alpha$}) is 4.2 {\plusmn} 0.1 kpc but the sizes span a large range, from compact objects with r$_{e}$ (H{$\alpha$}) \~{} 1.0 kpc to extended disks with r$_{e}$ (H{$\alpha$}) \~{} 15 kpc. Comparing H{$\alpha$} sizes to continuum sizes, we find $\lt$r$_{e}$ (H{$\alpha$})/r$_{e}$ (R) $\gt$ =1.3 {\plusmn} 0.1 for the full sample. That is, star formation, as traced by H{$\alpha$}, typically occurs out to larger radii than the rest-frame R-band stellar continuum; galaxies are growing their radii and building up from the inside out. This effect appears to be somewhat more pronounced for the largest galaxies. Using the measured H{$\alpha$} sizes, we derive star formation rate surface densities, {$\Sigma$}$_{SFR}$. We find that {$\Sigma$}$_{SFR}$ ranges from \~{}0.05 M $_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$ for the largest galaxies to \~{}5 M $_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$ for the smallest galaxies, implying a large range in physical conditions in rapidly star-forming z \~{} 1 galaxies. Finally, we infer that all galaxies in the sample have very high gas mass fractions and stellar mass doubling times $\lt$500 Myr. Although other explanations are also possible, a straightforward interpretation is that we are simultaneously witnessing the rapid formation of compact bulges and large disks at z \~{} 1.},

Our sample consists of 26 galaxies evolving in the redshift range z = 7 - 1, spanning the stellar mass range (0.2-6.4) {\times} 10$^{10}$ M$_{⊙}$ at z = 2. We recover the main trends by stacking the profiles in accordance to their evolution phases. Following a wet compaction event that typically occurs when the stellar mass is {\tilde}10$^{9.5}$ M$_{⊙}$ at z {\tilde} 2-4, the gas develops a cusp inside the effective radius, associated with a peak in star formation rate (SFR). The SFR peak and the associated feedback, in the absence of further gas inflow to the centre, marks the onset of gas depletion from the central 1 kpc, leading to quenching of the central SFR. An extended, star-forming ring that forms by fresh gas during the central quenching process shows as a rising specific SFR (sSFR) profile, which is interpreted as inside-out quenching. Before quenching, the stellar density profile grows self-similarly, maintaining its log-log shape because the sSFR is similar at all radii. During the quenching process, the stellar density saturates to a constant value, especially in the inner 1 kpc. The stellar mass and SFR profiles deduced from observations show very similar shapes, consistent with the scenario of wet compaction leading to inside-out quenching and the subsequent saturation of a dense stellar core. We predict a cuspy gas profile during the blue nugget phase, and a gas-depleted core, sometimes surrounded by a ring, in the post-blue nugget phase.},

  title       = {A dynamical mechanism for the origin of nuclear rings},
  abstract    = {We develop a dynamical theory for the origin of nuclear rings in barred galaxies. In analogy with the standard theory of accretion discs, our theory is based on shear viscous forces among nested annuli of gas. However, the fact that gas follows non circular orbits in an external barred potential has profound consequences: instead of driving all the gas to the centre, viscosity creates a trapping region where it is energetically favourable to form a stable ring which does not spread despite dissipation. Our theory allows us to approximately predict the size of the ring given the underlying gravitational potential. The size of the ring is loosely related to the location of the Inner Lindblad Resonance, but the predicted location is more accurate and is also valid for strongly barred potentials. By comparing analytical predictions with the results of hydrodynamical simulations, we find that our theory provides a viable mechanism for ring formation if the effective sound speed of the gas is low (cs<1km/s), but that nuclear spirals/shocks created by pressure destroy the ring when the sound speed is high (cs<10km/s). We conclude that whether this mechanism for ring formation is relevant for real galaxies ultimately depends on the effective equation of state of the ISM. Promising confirmation comes from simulations in which the ISM is modelled using state-of-the-art cooling functions coupled to live chemical networks, but more tests are needed regarding the role of turbulence driven by stellar feedback. If the mechanism is relevant in real galaxies, it could provide a powerful tool to constrain the gravitational potential, in particular the bar pattern speed.},

  abstract    = {Faint dwarf satellite galaxies are important as tracers of small-scale structure, but remain poorly characterized outside the Local Group, due to the difficulty of identifying them consistently at larger distances. We review a recently proposed method for estimating the average satellite population around a given sample of nearby bright galaxies, using a combination of size and magnitude cuts (to select low-redshift dwarf galaxies preferentially) and clustering measurements (to estimate the fraction of true satellites in the cut sample). We test this method using the high-precision photometric redshift catalog of the COSMOS survey, exploring the effect of specific cuts on the clustering signal. The most effective of the size-magnitude cuts considered recover the clustering signal around low-redshift primaries (z < 0.15) with about two-thirds of the signal and 80\%\ of the signal-to-noise ratio obtainable using the full COSMOS photometric redshifts. These cuts are also fairly efficient, with more than one third of the selected objects being clustered satellites. We conclude that structural selection represents a useful tool in characterizing dwarf populations to fainter magnitudes and/or over larger areas than are feasible with spectroscopic surveys. In reviewing the low-redshift content of the COSMOS field, we also note the existence of several dozen objects that appear resolved or partially resolved in the HST imaging, and are confirmed to be local (at distances of ∼250 Mpc or less) by their photometric or spectroscopic redshifts. This underlines the potential for future space-based surveys to reveal local populations of intrinsically faint galaxies through imaging alone. },

  title       = {Stellar Mass Profiles of Quiescent Galaxies in Different Environments at $z\sim0$},
  abstract    = {We present the stellar mass profiles of 147 isolated quiescent galaxies in very low-density environments (i.e., void regions) in the local Universe ($0.01<z<0.06$) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. These galaxies have stellar masses between $ 9.8\lesssim \log(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot})\lesssim11.2$ and they represent $\sim15\%$ of the whole galaxy population in the void regions down to $M_{r} = -19$. We do not find any isolated quiescent galaxies with $\log(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot})\gtrsim11.2$. We compare the stellar mass profiles of these isolated quiescent galaxies with the profiles of stellar mass-matched samples of the quiescent galaxies in group and cluster environments. We find that, at fixed mass, quiescent galaxies in voids have similar central ($1$ kpc) mass densities ($\Sigma_1$) and central velocity dispersions ($\sigma_1$) compared to their counterparts in groups and clusters. We show that quiescent galaxies in voids have at most $10-25\%$ smaller half-mass (and half-light) sizes compared to quiescent galaxies in groups and clusters. We conclude that for the intermediate stellar mass range of $10^{10}-10^{11}M_{\odot}$ in the local Universe, environmental mechanisms have no significant additional effect on the mass profiles of the quiescent galaxies.},

At redshift zero, this massive galaxy, having a maximum circular velocity $V_{\rm max}$ of 430 ${\rm km\ s^{-1}}$, contains a 100 kpc gas/stellar disk with morphology similar to Malin 1. The simulated galaxy reproduces well many observed features of Malin 1's vast disk, including its stellar ages, metallicities, and gas rotation curve. We trace the extended disk back in time and find that a large fraction of the cold gas at redshift zero originated from the cooling of hot halo gas, triggered by the merger of a pair of intruding galaxies. Our finding provides a novel way to form large galaxy disks as extreme as Malin 1 within the current galaxy formation framework.},

  abstract      = {HI self absorption (HISA) clouds are clumps of cold neutral hydrogen (HI) visible in front of warm background gas, which makes them ideal places to study the properties of the cold atomic component of the interstellar medium (ISM). The Riegel-Crutcher (R-C) cloud is the most striking HISA feature in the Galaxy. It is one of the closest HISA clouds to us and is located in the direction of the Galactic Centre, which provides a bright background. High-resolution interferometric measurements have revealed the filamentary structure of this cloud, however it is difficult to accurately determine the temperature and the density of the gas without optical depth measurements. In this paper we present new HI absorption observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) against 46 continuum sources behind the Riegel-Crutcher cloud to directly measure the optical depth of the cloud. We decompose the complex HI absorption spectra into Gaussian components using an automated machine learning algorithm. We find 300 Gaussian components, from which 67 are associated with the R-C cloud (0 $\lt$ v\_$\{$LSR$\}$ $\lt$ 10 kms, FWHM $\lt$ 10 kms). Combining the new HI absorption data with HI emission data from previous surveys we calculate the spin temperature and find it to be between 20 and 80 K. Our measurements uncover a temperature gradient across the cloud with spin temperatures decreasing towards positive Galactic latitudes. We also find three new OH absorption lines associated with the cloud, which support the presence of molecular gas.},

  title       = {The formation of extremely diffuse galaxy cores by merging supermassive black holes},
  abstract    = {Given its velocity dispersion, the early-type galaxy NGC 1600 has an unusually massive ($M_\bullet = 1.7 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$) central supermassive black hole (SMBH), surrounded by a large core ($r_\mathrm{b} = 0.7$ kpc) with a tangentially biased stellar distribution. We present high-resolution equal-mass merger simulations including SMBHs to study the formation of such systems. The structural parameters of the progenitor ellipticals were chosen to produce merger remnants resembling NGC 1600. We test initial stellar density slopes of $\rho \propto r^{-1}$ and $\rho \propto r^{-3/2}$ and vary the initial SMBH masses from $8.5 \times 10^8$ to $8.5 \times 10^9$ $M_\odot$. With increasing SMBH mass the merger remnants show a systematic decrease in central surface brightness, an increasing core size, and an increasingly tangentially biased central velocity anisotropy. Two-dimensional kinematic maps reveal decoupled, rotating core regions for the most massive SMBHs. The stellar cores form rapidly as the SMBHs become bound, while the velocity anisotropy develops more slowly after the SMBH binaries become hard. The simulated merger remnants follow distinct relations between the core radius and the sphere-of-influence, and the SMBH mass, similar to observed systems. We find a systematic change in the relations as a function of the progenitor density slope, and present a simple scouring model reproducing this behavior. Finally, we find the best agreement with NGC 1600 using SMBH masses totaling the observed value of $M_\bullet = 1.7 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$. In general, density slopes of $\rho \propto r^{-3/2}$ for the progenitor galaxies are strongly favored for the equal-mass merger scenario.},

The growth history has been traced by performing two-component bulge-disk decomposition and further classifying the bulges into pseudos and classicals using the Kormendy relation. We have about 27\% pseudo and 40\% classical bulges in our sample. Classical bulges are brighter than pseudo, in both rest-bands, at all redshifts probed here; in fact since z{\tilde} 0.77, classicals are about {\tilde}1 mag brighter than pseudo bulges. Both bulges have witnessed substantial growth, more than half of their present-day stellar mass has been gained since z{\tilde} 1. Their host disks have grown concurrently, becoming progressively brighter in rest-frame I-band. The high-redshift host disks of both pseudo and classical bulges are found to be equally clumpy in rest-frame B-band. In the same band, we found that the growth of classical bulges is accompanied by fading of their host disks{\mdash}which might be an indication of secular processes in action. However, both host disk as well as the bulge have grown substantially in terms of stellar mass. Our analysis suggests that clump migration and secular processes alone cannot account for the bulge growth, since z{\tilde} 1, accretion, and minor mergers would be required.},

For the first time, we find clear evidence of a molecular collision front whose velocity dispersion is 16.8$\pm$1.4 km s$^{-1}$ at the overlapping region owing to high spatial and velocity resolution. By integrating over the velocity width that corresponds to the molecular collision front, we find a long filamentary structure with a size of 1800 pc $\times$ 350 pc at the collision front. This filamentary molecular structure spatially coincides with a dark-lane seen in R-band image. We find four molecular clouds in the filament, each with a radius of 30 pc and mass of 10$^{6} M_{\odot}$; the radii matching a typical value for giant molecular clouds and the masses corresponding to those between giant molecular clouds and giant molecular associations. All four clouds are gravitationally bound. The molecular filamentary structure and its physical conditions are similar to the structure expected via numerical simulation. The filament could be a progenitor of super star clusters.},

The number density of local compact galaxies with luminosity weighted (LW) ages compatible with being already passive at high redshift is compared with the density of compact passive galaxies observed at high-z. Our results place an upper limit of a factor \~{}2 on the evolution of the number density and are inconsistent with a significant size evolution for most of the compact galaxies observed at high-z. Instead, the evolution may be significant (up to a factor five) for the most extreme, ultracompact galaxies. Considering all compact galaxies, regardless of LW age and star formation activity, a minority of local compact galaxies ($\lt$=1/3) might have formed at z $\lt$ 1. Finally, we show that the secular decrease of the galaxy stellar mass due to simple stellar evolution may in some cases be a non-negligible factor in the context of the evolution of the mass-size relation, and we caution that passive evolution in mass should be taken into account when comparing samples at different redshifts.},

We use a volume-limited sample drawn from the publicly available SDSS DR7, and base our analysis on aperture-matched sampling by selecting sets of galaxies where the SDSS fibre probes a fixed fraction of $\mathrm{R\_e}$. We find that between 0.5 and 1.5 $\mathrm{R\_e}$, the gas-phase metallicity correlates more tightly with $\Phi$ than with either $\mathrm{M}$ or $\Sigma$, in that for all aperture-matched samples, the potential-metallicity relation has (i) less scatter, (ii) higher Spearman rank correlation coefficient and (iii) less residual trend with $\mathrm{R\_e}$ than either the mass-metallicity relation and the average surface density-metallicity relation. Our result is broadly consistent with the current models of gas enrichment and metal loss.

We do not find evident correlations between the H$\alpha$+[NII] emission and global properties such as X-ray luminosity, mass of hot gas, and gas mass fraction. We find that the presence of H$\alpha$+[NII] emission is more likely in systems with higher densities, lower entropies, shallower entropy profiles, lower values of min($t\_{\rm cool}/t\_{\rm ff}$), and disturbed X-ray morphologies which are tightly linked with the level of turbulent motions. However, we see no clear separations in the observables obtained for galaxies with and without optical emission line nebulae. We detected X-ray emitting central AGNs in 11 of the 25 H$\alpha$+[NII] emitting galaxies (\~{}44\%), and in only three of the 20 galaxies without any optical emission line nebulae. The AGN jet powers of the galaxies with X-ray cavities show hint of a possible weak positive correlation withtheir H$\alpha$+[NII] luminosities. This correlation and the observed trends in the thermodynamic properties may result from chaotic cold accretion (CCA) powering AGN jets, as seen in some high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations.},

On average, in each halo this model predicts about $20$ inner satellite galaxies , among them $5$ are comparable to the classic satellites in the luminosity, these are in stark contrast to the corresponding numbers in observations. We further investigate the survivability of these model inner satellites in the presence of a central stellar disk with a set of ideal simulations. These are done by re-evolving a quarter (30) of the whole $Aquarius$ inner satellite galaxies (121) by including a static disk potential in addition to the MW halo. Our finding is that, while the additional disk can completely disrupt some satellites with very close percentres, 60 percent of them could still survive to the present day. This results in $14$ satellite galaxies within the $40$ kpc of each $Aquarius$ when taking into account of the MW disk, still a factor of 2 more abundant than the observed number. Therefore, unless half a dozen satellite galaxies could be discovered within $40$ kpc of the MW by future surveys, the deficiency in the inner satellite galaxy population may post a serious challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM theory.},

  abstract      = {We report the discovery of the most distant radio galaxy to date, TGSS1530 at a redshift of $z=5.72$ close to the presumed end of the Epoch of Reionisation. The radio galaxy was selected from the TGSS ADR1 survey at 150 MHz for having to an ultra-steep spectral index, $\alpha^{\textrm{150 MHz}}\_{\textrm{1.4 GHz}} = -1.4$ and a compact morphology obtained using VLA imaging at 1.4 GHz. No optical or infrared counterparts for it were found in publicly available sky surveys. Follow-up optical spectroscopy at the radio position using GMOS on Gemini North revealed the presence of a single emission line. We identify this line as Lyman alpha at $z=5.72$, because of its asymmetric line profile, the absence of other optical/UV lines in the spectrum and a high equivalent width. With a Ly$\alpha$ luminosity of $5.7 \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and a FWHM of $370$ km s$^{-1}$, TGSS1530 is comparable to `non-radio' Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) at a similar redshift. However, with a radio luminosity of $\log L\_{\textrm{150 MHz}} = 29.1$ W Hz$^{-1}$ and a deconvolved physical size $3.5$ kpc, its radio properties are similar to other known radio galaxies at $z\gt4$. Subsequent $J$ and $K$ band imaging using LUCI on the Large Binocular Telescope resulted in non-detection of the host galaxy down to $3\sigma$ limits of $J\gt24.4$ and $K\gt22.4$ (Vega). The $K$ band limit is consistent with $z\gt5$ from the $K-z$ relation for radio galaxies, suggesting stellar mass limits using simple stellar population models of $M\_{\textrm{stars}}\lt 10^{10.5}$ $M\_\odot$. Its high redshift coupled with relatively small radio and Ly$\alpha$ sizes suggest that TGSS1530 may be a radio galaxy in an early phase of its evolution.},

  abstract      = {Recent observations have discovered an escape of ionizing Lyman-continuum radiation from a population of compact, actively star-forming galaxies at redshift z\~{}0.3, also known as ``green peas''. We here study the peculiar green pea Lyman-alpha (Lya) spectra, which are mostly double-peaked, unlike in any other galaxy sample. We select a sample of twelve archival green peas and we apply numerical radiative transfer models to reproduce the observed Lya spectral profiles, using the geometry of expanding, homogeneous spherical shells. We use ancillary optical and ultraviolet data to constrain the model parameters, and we evaluate the match between the models and the observed Lya spectra. As a second step, we allow all the fitting parameters to be free, and examine the agreement between the interstellar medium parameters derived from the models and those from ancillary data. The green pea double-peaked Lya line profiles are not correctly reproduced by the constrained shell models. Conversely, unconstrained models fit the spectra, but parameters derived from the best-fitting models are not in agreement with the ancillary data. In particular: 1) the best-fit systemic redshifts are larger by 10 - 250 km/s than those derived from optical emission lines, 2) the double-peaked Lya profiles are best reproduced with low-velocity ($\lt$150 km/s) outflows that contradict the observed ultraviolet absorption lines of low-ionization-state elements with characteristic velocities as large as 300 km/s, and 3) the models need to consider intrinsic Lya profiles that are on average three times broader than the observed Balmer lines. Differences between the modelled and observed velocities are larger for targets with prominent Lya blue peaks. The blue peak position and flux appear to be connected to low column densities of neutral hydrogen, leading to Lya and Lyman-continuum escape.},

The wide-area, high spatial resolution survey data from WFIRST will be unsurpassed for many decades into the future. With the current baseline design, the WFIRST filter complement will extend from the bluest wavelength allowed by the optical design to a reddest filter (F184W) that has a red cutoff at 2.0 microns. In this white paper, we outline some of the science advantages for adding a Ks filter with a 2.15 micron central wavelength in order to extend the wavelength coverage for WFIRST as far to the red as the possible given the thermal performance of the observatory and the sensitivity of the detectors.},

  abstract      = {We present new ALMA observations and physical properties of a Lyman Break Galaxy at $z=7.15$. Our target, B14-65666, has a bright ultra-violet (UV) absolute magnitude, Muv \~{} -22.3, and has been spectroscopically identified in Ly$\alpha$ with a small rest-frame equivalent width of \~{} 4 $\backslash$AA. With ALMA, we have detected spatially resolved [OIII] 88 $\mu$m, [CII] 158 $\mu$m, and dust continuum emission at 5.8$\sigma$, 10.6$\sigma$, and 5.3$\sigma$ respectively. The [OIII] and [CII] lines have consistent redshifts of $7.1520\pm0.0003$, and the [OIII] luminosity, $(28.6\pm4.8) \times 10^{8}$ $L\_{\rm \odot}$, is twice higher than the [CII] luminosity, $(13.3\pm1.4) \times 10^{8}$ $L\_{\rm \odot}$. Owing to our high spatial resolution data with beam sizes of $\approx 0''.3 \times 0''.2$ ($0''.3\times0''.3$) in Band 6 (Band 8), [CII] and [OIII] reveal velocity gradients of $\approx200$ km/s. Based on morphologies of [CII] and rest-frame UV emission, we argue that the velocity gradient would be due to a merger event. The merger scenario is also supported from a significant dust mass, $(1-6)\times10^{7}$ $M\_{\rm \odot}$, which cannot be easily reproduced without considering past star-formation activity. These results imply that B14-65666 is a merger induced starburst galaxy. We also measure the Ly$\alpha$ velocity offset with respect to the ALMA lines. The value $\Delta v\_{\rm Ly\alpha} =772\pm45$ km/s is the largest so far detected among the z $\gt$ 6 galaxy population. Based on a sample of 17 galaxies with $\Delta v\_{\rm Ly\alpha}$ measurements from this study and the literature at z \~{} 6-8, we find that $\Delta v\_{\rm Ly\alpha}$ values become larger for galaxies with brighter UV magnitudes or higher [CII] luminosities. These trends are consistent with the idea that the visibility of Ly$\alpha$ during the reionizatin epoch is dependent of the objects' luminosities.},

Our fiducial stellar feedback model, implementing strong stellar driven outflows, reproduces relatively well the variations of passive fractions as a function of galaxy stellar mass and halo mass measured in the local Universe, as well as the `quenching' time-scales inferred from the data. We show that the same level of agreement can be obtained by using an alternative stellar feedback scheme featuring lower ejection rates at high redshift, and modifying the treatment for hot gas stripping. We find that, in this case, a good agreement with data can be obtained only by making the unrealistic assumption that cooling can continue on satellites even after their parent dark matter substructure is stripped below the resolution of the simulation. We explain that the better agreement of our fiducial model is due to (i) a larger cold gas fraction of satellites at the time of accretion and (ii) a lower rate of gas reheating by supernovae explosions and stellar winds with respect to previous versions of our model. Our results suggest that the abundance of passive galaxies with stellar mass larger than \~{}10\^{}10 Msun is primarily determined by the self-regulation between star formation and stellar feedback, with environmental processes playing a more marginal role.},

Using the EM2D method, we have assembled a catalog of emission line galaxies (ELGs) with resolved star formation from each of the four FIGS fields. Not only can one better assess the global properties of ELGs, but the EM2D method allows for the analysis and an improved study of the individual emission-line region $\{$$\backslash$it within$\}$ each galaxy. This paper includes a description of the methodology, advantages, and the first results of the EM2D method applied to ELGs in FIGS. The advantage of 2D emission line measurements includes significant improvement of galaxy redshift measurements, approaching the level of accuracy seen in high spectral resolution data, but with greater efficiency; and the ability to identify and measure the properties of multiple sites of star-formation and over scales of $\sim$ 1 kpc within individual galaxies out to z $\sim$ 4. The EM2D method also significantly improves the reliability of high-redshift (z $\sim$ 7) Lyman-$\alpha$ detections. Coupled with the wide field-of-view and high efficiency of space-based grism observations, EM2D provides a noteworthy improvement on the physical parameters that can be extracted from grism observations.},

  abstract      = {We present results from the LymAn Continuum Escape Survey (LACES), a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) program designed to characterize the ionizing radiation emerging from a sample of Lyman alpha emitting galaxies at redshift $z\simeq 3.1$. As many show intense [O III] emission characteristic of $z\gt6.5$ star-forming galaxies, they may represent valuable low redshift analogs of galaxies in the reionization era. Using HST Wide Field Camera 3 / UVIS $F336W$ to image Lyman continuum emission, we investigate the escape fraction of ionizing photons in this sample. For 61 sources, of which 77\% are spectroscopically confirmed and 53 have measures of [O III] emission, we detect Lyman continuum leakage in 30\%, a rate significantly higher than in continuum-selected Lyman break galaxies. We estimate there is a 97\% probability that $\leq 3$ of our detections could be affected by foreground contamination. Fitting multi-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to take account of the varying stellar populations, dust extinctions and metallicities, we derive individual Lyman continuum escape fractions corrected for foreground intergalactic absorption. We find escape fractions of 2 to 82\% for individual objects, and infer an average 20\% escape fraction by fitting composite SEDs for our detected samples. Surprisingly however, even a deep stack of those sources with no individual $F336W$ detections provides a stringent upper limit on the average escape fraction of less than 0.3\%. We examine various correlations with source properties and discuss the implications in the context of the popular picture that cosmic reionization is driven by such compact, low metallicity star-forming galaxies.},

However, it remains an open question as to what extent both merging and non-merging interactions have in triggering starbursts? In this study, we make use of the Illustris simulation to test how different triggering mechanisms can effect starburst events. We examine star formation rate, colour and environment of starburst galaxies to determine if this could be why we witness a bimodality in post-starburst populations within observational studies. Further, we briefly test the extent of quenching due to AGN feedback. From Illustris, we select 196 starburst galaxies at z = 0.15 and split them into post-merger and pre-merger/harassment driven starburst samples. We find that 55\% of this sample not undergone a merger in the past 2 Gyr. Both of our samples are located in low-density environments within the filament regions of the cosmic web, however we find that pre-merger/harassment driven starburst are in higher density environments than post-merger driven starbursts. We also find that pre-merger/harassment starbursts are redder than post-merger starbursts, this could be driven by environmental effects. Both however, produce nuclear starbursts of comparable strengths.},

  abstract      = {We study the growth pathways of Brightest Central Galaxies (BCGs) and Intra-Cluster Light (ICL) by means of a semi-analytic model. We assume that the ICL forms by stellar stripping of satellite galaxies and violent processes during mergers, and implement two independent models: (1) one considers both mergers and stellar stripping (named $\{$$\backslash$small STANDARD$\}$ model), and one considers only mergers (named $\{$$\backslash$small MERGERS$\}$ model). We find that BCGs and ICL form, grow and overall evolve at different times and with different timescales, but they show a clear co-evolution after redshift $z \sim 0.7-0.8$. Around 90$\backslash$\% of the ICL from stellar stripping is built-up in the innermost 150 Kpc from the halo centre and the dominant contribution comes from disk-like galaxies (B/T$\lt$0.4) through a large number of small/intermediate stripping events ($M\_{strip}/M\_{sat}\lt0.3$). The fractions of stellar mass in BCGs and in ICL over the total stellar mass within the virial radius of the halo evolve differently with time. At high redshift, the BCG accounts for the bulk of the mass, but its contribution gradually decreases with time and stays constant after $z\sim 0.4-0.5$. The ICL, instead, grows very fast and its contribution keeps increasing down to the present time. The $\{$$\backslash$small STANDARD$\}$ and the $\{$$\backslash$small MERGERS$\}$ models make very similar predictions in most of the cases, but predict different amounts of ICL associated to other galaxies within the virial radius of the group/cluster other than the BCG, at $z=0$. We then suggest that this quantity is a valid observable that can shed light on the relative importance of mergers and stellar stripping for the formation of the ICL.},

The former corresponds to emission from AGN-heated dust only, whereas the latter includes emission from dust heated by stars and AGN. Our results show that the two luminosity functions are substantially different below 10\^{}13 Lsun but converge in the HyLIRG regime. We find that the fraction of AGN dominated sources increases with total infrared luminosity and at LIR $\gt$10\^{}13.5 Lsun AGN can account for the entire infrared emission.

Old UCMGs, which are expected to have undergone very few merger events, provide a unique view on the accretion history of the most massive galaxies in the Universe, allowing to constrain the rate of merging predicted by numerical simulations. Over an effective sky area of nearly 330 square degrees, we select UCMG candidates from the KiDS multi-colour images, which provide high quality structural parameters and stellar masses, as well as precise photometric redshifts from machine learning techniques. Spectroscopic redshifts are then required to validate UCMG candidates. Here we describe a programme designed to obtain these redshifts using different facilities, starting with first results for 28 galaxies with redshifts $z \lt 0.5$, obtained at NTT and TNG telescopes. We confirmed, as bona fide UCMGs, 19 out of the 28 candidates with new redshifts, whereas a further 46 UCMG candidates are confirmed with literature redshifts (35 at $z\lt0.5$). The sample of 63 lower-z galaxies is the largest at redshifts below 0.5, and it includes the first UCMGs discovered in the Southern Hemisphere, outside the area covered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We also use the spectroscopic redshifts to quantify systematic errors in the candidate selection based on the KiDS photometric redshifts, and use these to correct our UCMG number counts. We finally compare the results to independent datasets and simulations. Our sample of 1000 photometrically selected UCMGs at $z \lt 0.5$ represents the largest sample of UCMG candidates assembled to date over the largest sky area.},

  abstract      = {All measurements of cosmic star formation must assume an initial distribution of stellar masses -- the stellar initial mass function -- in order to extrapolate from the star-formation rate measured for typically rare, massive stars ($\gt$ 8 Msun) to the total star-formation rate across the full stellar mass spectrum. The shape of the stellar initial mass function in various galaxy populations underpins our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. Classical determinations of the stellar initial mass function in local galaxies are traditionally made at ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared wavelengths, which cannot be probed in dust-obscured galaxies, especially in distant starbursts, whose apparent star-formation rates are hundreds to thousands of times higher than in our Milky Way, selected at submillimetre (rest-frame far-infrared) wavelengths. The 13C/18O abundance ratio in the cold molecular gas -- which can be probed via the rotational transitions of the 13CO and C18O isotopologues -- is a very sensitive index of the stellar initial mass function, with its determination immune to the pernicious effects of dust. Here we report observations of 13CO and C18O emission for a sample of four dust-enshrouded starbursts at redshifts of approximately two to three, and find unambiguous evidence for a top-heavy stellar initial mass function in all of them. A low 13CO/C18O ratio for all our targets -- alongside a well-tested, detailed chemical evolution model benchmarked on the Milky Way -- implies that there are considerably more massive stars in starburst events than in ordinary star-forming spiral galaxies. This can bring these extraordinary starbursts closer to the `main sequence' of star-forming galaxies, though such main-sequence galaxies may not be immune to changes in initial stellar mass function, depending upon their star-formation densities.},

  abstract      = {We present a detailed spatial analysis of stellar populations based on long-slit optical spectra in a sample of eight luminous early-type galaxies selected from nearby sparse groups and pairs, three of them may be interacting with a galaxy of similar mass. We have measured luminosity-weighted averages of age, [M/H], [Fe/H], and [$\alpha$/Fe] to add empirical data relative to the influence of galaxy mass, environment, interaction, and AGN feedback in their formation and evolution. The stellar population of the individual galaxies were determined through the stellar population synthesis code STARLIGHT using semi-empirical simple stellar population models. Radial variations of luminosity-weighted means of age, [M/H], [Fe/H], and [$\alpha$/Fe] were measured up to half of the effective radius of each galaxy. We found trends between these values and the nuclear stellar velocity dispersion. There are also relations between the metallicity/age gradients and the velocity dispersion. Contributions of 1-4 Gyr old stellar populations were found in IC5328 and NGC6758 as well as 4-8 Gyr old ones in NGC5812. Extended gas is present in IC5328, NGC1052, NGC1209, and NGC6758, and the presence of a LINER is identified in all these galaxies. The regions up to one effective radius of all galaxies are dominated by $\alpha$-enhanced metal-rich old stellar populations likely due to rapid star formation episodes that induced efficient chemical enrichment. On average, the age and [$\alpha$/Fe] gradients are null and the [M/H] gradients are negative, although discordant cases were found. We found no correlation between the stellar population properties and the LINER presence as well as between the stellar properties and environment or gravitational interaction, suggesting that the influence of progenitor mass can-not be discarded in the formation and evolution of early-type galaxies.},

  abstract      = {The physical origin of the near-ultraviolet MgII emission remains an under-explored domain, contrary to more typical emission lines detected in the spectra of star-forming galaxies. We explore the nebular and physical properties for a sample of 381 galaxies between 0.70 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2.34 drawn from the MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Survey. The spectra of these galaxies show a wide variety of profiles of the MgII 2796,2803 resonant doublet, from absorption to emission. We present a study on the main drivers for the detection of MgII emission in galaxy spectra. By exploiting photoionization models we verified that the emission-line ratios observed in galaxies with MgII in emission are consistent with nebular emission from HII regions. From a simultaneous analysis of MUSE spectra and ancillary HST information via spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, we find that galaxies with MgII in emission have lower stellar masses, smaller sizes, bluer spectral slopes and lower optical depth than those with absorption. This leads us to suggest that MgII emission is a potential tracer of physical conditions not merely related to those of the ionized gas. We show that these differences in MgII emission/absorption can be explained in terms of a higher dust and neutral gas content in the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies showing MgII in absorption, confirming the extreme sensitivity of MgII to the presence of the neutral ISM. We conclude with an analogy between the MgII doublet and the Ly-alpha line, due to their resonant nature. Further investigations with current and future facilities, including JWST, are promising as the detection of MgII emission and its potential connection with Ly-alpha could provide new insights on the ISM content in the early Universe.},

  abstract      = {Searching for extreme emission line galaxies allows us to find low-mass metal-poor galaxies that are good analogs of high redshift Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies. These low-mass extreme emission line galaxies are also potential Lyman-continuum leakers. Finding them at very low redshifts ($z\lesssim0.05$) allows us to be sensitive to even lower stellar masses and metallicities. We report on a sample of extreme emission line galaxies at $z\lesssim0.05$ (blueberry galaxies). We selected them from SDSS broadband images on the basis of their broad band colors, and studied their properties with MMT spectroscopy. From the whole SDSS DR12 photometric catalog, we found 51 photometric candidates. We spectroscopically confirm 40 as blueberry galaxies. (An additional 7 candidates are contaminants, and 4 remain without spectra.) These blueberries are dwarf starburst galaxies with very small sizes ($\lt 1\hbox{kpc}$), and very high ionization ([OIII]/[OII]$\sim10-60$). They also have some of the lowest stellar masses ($\log(\hbox{M}/\hbox{M}\_{\odot})\sim6.5-7.5$) and lowest metallicities ($7.1\lt12+\log(\hbox{O/H})\lt7.8$) starburst galaxies. Thus they are small counterparts to green peas and high redshift Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies.},

LAEs were selected to have observed frame equivalent widths $\gt$80 {\AA} and emission line fluxes $\gt$1.5{\times}10$^{-17}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Only 1\% of our LAE sample appears to host AGNs. The LAEs exhibit a moderate spatial correlation length of r$_{0}$=3.6$^{+0.8}$$_{-1.0}$ Mpc, corresponding to a bias factor b=1.7$^{+0.3}$$_{-0.4}$, which implies median dark matter halo masses of log10M$_{med}$=10.9$^{+0.5}$$_{-0.9}$ M$_{solar}$. Comparing the number density of LAEs, 1.5+/-0.3{\times}10$^{-3}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, with the number density of these halos finds a mean halo occupation \~{}1\%-10\%. The evolution of galaxy bias with redshift implies that most z=3.1 LAEs evolve into present-day galaxies with L$\lt$2.5L$^{*}$, whereas other z$\gt$3 galaxy populations typically evolve into more massive galaxies. Halo merger trees show that z=0 descendants occupy halos with a wide range of masses, with a median descendant mass close to that of L$^{*}$. Only 30\% of LAEs have sufficient stellar mass ($\gt$\~{}3{\times}10$^{9}$ M$_{solar}$) to yield detections in deep Spitzer IRAC imaging. A two-population SED fit to the stacked UBVRIzJK+[3.6, 4.5, 5.6, 8.0] {$\mu$}m fluxes of the IRAC-undetected objects finds that the typical LAE has low stellar mass (1.0$^{+0.6}$$_{-0.4}${\times}10$^{9}$ M$_{solar}$), moderate star formation rate (2+/-1 M$_{solar}$ yr$^{-1}$), a young component age of 20$^{+30}$$_{-10}$ Myr, and little dust (A$_{V}$$\lt$0.2). The best-fit model has 20\% of the mass in the young stellar component, but models without evolved stars are also allowed.  This work is based on archival data obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with NASA, and observations made with the 6.5 m Magellan-Baade telescope, a collaboration between the Observatories of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, University of Arizona, Harvard University, University of Michigan, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, a division of the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.},

  abstract      = {As Ly{$\alpha$} photons are scattered by neutral hydrogen, a change with redshift in the Ly{$\alpha$} equivalent width (EW) distribution of distant galaxies offers a promising probe of the degree of ionization in the intergalactic medium and hence when cosmic reionization ended. This simple test is complicated by the fact that Ly{$\alpha$} emission can also be affected by variations in the kinematics and dust content of the host galaxies. In the first paper in this series, we demonstrated both a luminosity- and redshift-dependent trend in the fraction of Ly{$\alpha$} emitters seen within color-selected ``Lyman break'' galaxies (LBGs) over the range 3 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 6; lower luminosity galaxies and those at higher redshift show an increased likelihood of strong emission. Here, we present the results from 12.5 hr exposures with the Keck DEIMOS spectrograph focused primarily on LBGs at z \~{}= 6 which enable us to confirm the redshift dependence of line emission more robustly and to higher redshift than was hitherto possible. We find that 54\% {\plusmn} 11\% of faint z \~{}= 6 LBGs show strong (W $_{Lyα,0}$$\gt$25 {\AA}) emission, an increase of 55\% from a sample of similarly luminous z \~{}= 4 galaxies. With a total sample of 74 z \~{}= 6 LBGs, we determine the luminosity-dependent Ly{$\alpha$} EW distribution. Assuming continuity in these trends to the new population of z \~{}= 7 sources located with the Hubble WFC3/IR camera, we predict that unless the neutral fraction rises in the intervening 200 Myr, the success rate for spectroscopic confirmation using Ly{$\alpha$} emission should be high.},

The galaxies are located at relatively low redshifts, $z\sim$0.3, with morphologies ranging from extended and disturbed to compact and smooth. To complement the HST observations we also analyze observations taken with the VIMOS spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). In our galaxy sample we identify three objects with double peak Lyman-$\alpha$ profiles similar to those seen in Green Pea compact galaxies and measure peak separations of 655, 374, and 275 km s$^{-1}$. We measure Lyman-$\alpha$ escape fractions with values ranging between 5-13$\backslash$\%. Given the low flux levels in the individual COS exposures we apply a weighted stacking approach to obtain a single spectrum. From this COS combined spectrum we infer upper limits for the absolute and relative Lyman continuum escape fractions of $f\_{\rm abs}(\rm LyC)$ = 0.4$^{+10.1}\_{-0.4}$$\backslash$\% and $f\_{\rm res}(\rm LyC)$ = 1.7$^{+15.2}\_{-1.7}$$\backslash$\%, respectively.

  abstract      = {The Mg II 2796,2803 doublet is often used to measure interstellar medium absorption in galaxies, thereby serving as a diagnostic for feedback and outflows. However, the interpretation of Mg II remains confusing, due to resonant trapping and re-emission of the photons, analogous to Lyman Alpha. Therefore, in this paper, we present new MMT Blue Channel Spectrograph observations of Mg II for a sample of 10 Green Pea galaxies at z\~{}0.2-0.3, where Lyman Alpha was previously observed with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on Hubble Space Telescope. With strong, (mostly) double-peaked Lyman Alpha profiles, these galaxies allow us to observe Mg II in the limit of low H I column density. We find strong Mg II emission and little-to-no absorption. We use photoionization models to show that nebular Mg II from H II regions is non-negligible, and the ratios of Mg II/[OIII] 5007 vs. [OIII] 5007/[OII] 3727 form a tight sequence. Using this relation, we predict intrinsic Mg II flux, and show that Mg II escape fractions range from 0 to 0.9. We find that the Mg II escape fraction correlates tightly with the Lyman Alpha escape fraction, and the Mg II line profiles show evidence for broader and more redshifted emission when the escape fractions are low. These trends are expected if the escape fractions and velocity profiles of Lyman Alpha and Mg II are shaped by resonant scattering in the same low column density gas. As a consequence of a close relation with Lyman Alpha, Mg II may serve as a useful diagnostic in the epoch of reionization, where Lyman Alpha and Lyman continuum photons are not easily observed.},

Green Pea galaxies are relatively small, compact (a few kpc across) galaxies that get their green color from strong [OIII]$\lambda$5007$\backslash$AA$\backslash$ emission, an indicator of intense, recent star formation. These two galaxies were predicted to have the highest observed count rates, using the X-ray luminosity -- star formation rate ($L\_X$--SFR) relation for X-ray binaries, from a statistically complete sample drawn from optical criteria. We determine the X-ray luminosity relative to star-formation rate and metallicity for these two galaxies. Neither exhibit any evidence of active galactic nuclei and we suspect the X-ray emission originates from unresolved populations of high mass X-ray binaries. We discuss the $L\_X$--SFR--metallicity plane for star-forming galaxies and show that the two LCGs are consistent with the prediction of this relation.

  abstract      = {Green Peas are nearby analogs of high-redshift Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies. To probe their Ly$\alpha$ escape, we study the spatial profiles of Ly$\alpha$ and UV continuum emission of 24 Green Pea galaxies using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We extract the spatial profiles of Ly$\alpha$ emission from their 2D COS spectra, and of UV continuum from both the 2D spectra and NUV images. The Ly$\alpha$ emission shows more extended spatial profiles than the UV continuum in most Green Peas. The deconvolved Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) of the Ly$\alpha$ spatial profile is about 2 to 4 times that of the UV continuum in most cases. Since Green Peas are analogs of high-z LAEs, it suggests that most high-z LAEs likely have larger Ly$\alpha$ sizes than UV sizes. We also compare the spatial profiles of Ly$\alpha$ photons at blueshifted and redshifted velocities in eight Green Peas with sufficient data quality, and find the blue wing of the Ly$\alpha$ line has a larger spatial extent than the red wing in four Green Peas with comparatively weak blue Ly$\alpha$ line wings. We show that Green Peas and MUSE $z=3-6$ LAEs have similar Ly$\alpha$ and UV continuum sizes, which probably suggests starbursts in both low-z and high-z LAEs drive similar gas outflows illuminated by Ly$\alpha$ light. Five Lyman continuum (LyC) leakers in this sample have similar Ly$\alpha$ to UV continuum size ratios (\~{}1.4-4.3) to the other Green Peas, indicating their LyC emission escape through ionized holes in the interstellar medium.},

In this work, we present a study into how two well-used selection techniques have consequences on observable post-starburst galaxy parameters, such as colour, morphology and environment, and how this affects interpretations of their role in the galaxy duty cycle. We identify a master sample of H {$\delta$} strong (EW$_{H δ}$ $\gt$ 3{\AA}) post-starburst galaxies from the value-added catalogue in the seventh data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR7) over a redshift range 0.01 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 0.1. From this sample we select two E+A subsets, both having a very little [O II] emission (EW\_[O II] $\gt$ -2.5 {\AA}) but one having an additional cut on EW$_{Hα}$ ($\gt$-3 {\AA}). We examine the differences in observables and AGN fractions to see what effect the H {$\alpha$} cut has on the properties of post-starburst galaxies and what these differing samples can tell us about the duty cycle of post-starburst galaxies. We find that H {$\delta$} strong galaxies peak in the 'blue cloud', E+As in the 'green valley' and pure E+As in the 'red sequence'. We also find that pure E+As have a more early-type morphology and a higher fraction in denser environments compared with the H {$\delta$} strong and E+A galaxies. These results suggest that there is an evolutionary sequence in the post-starburst phase from blue discy galaxies with residual star formation to passive red early-types.},

We derive hydrogen column densities or their upper limits toward the nine sources from our observations and compare them to those expected from CO line emission and far-infrared dust continuum emission. Toward the seven sources with no HCO$^+$ detection, CO emission has not been detected, either. Thus the sight lines are likely to be filled with almost pure atomic gas. Toward the two sources with HCO$^+$ detection, CO emission has been also detected. Comparison of the H$\_2$ column densities from HCO$^+$ absorption and CO emission suggests a non-negligible amount of DMG toward B0838+133.},

Some UDGs have large populations of globular clusters (GCs), something unexpected in galaxies with such low stellar density and mass. We have carried out a comprehensive study of GCs in both UDGs and classical dwarf galaxies at comparable stellar masses using HST observations of the Coma cluster. We present new imaging for 33 Dragonfly UDGs with the largest effective radii ($\gt2$ kpc), and additionally include 15 UDGs and 54 classical dwarf galaxies from the HST/ACS Coma Treasury Survey and the literature. Out of a total of 48 UDGs, 27 have statistically significant GC systems, and 11 have candidate nuclear star clusters. The GC specific frequency ($S\_N$) varies dramatically, with the mean $S\_N$ being higher for UDGs than for classical dwarfs. At constant stellar mass, galaxies with larger sizes (or lower surface brightnesses) have higher $S\_N$, with the trend being stronger at higher stellar mass. At lower stellar masses, UDGs tend to have higher $S\_N$ when closer to the center of the cluster, i.e., in denser environments. The fraction of UDGs with a nuclear star cluster also depends on environment, varying from $\sim\!40$$\backslash$\% in the cluster core, where it is slightly lower than the nucleation fraction of classical dwarfs, to $\lesssim20\\%$ in the outskirts. Collectively, we observe an unmistakable diversity in the abundance of GCs, and this may point to multiple formation routes.},

  abstract      = {We present AKARI 2.5-5um spectra of 145 local luminous infrared galaxies in the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey. In all of the spectra, we measure the line fluxes and EQWs of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) at 3.3um and the hydrogen recombination line Br-alpha, with apertures matched to the slit sizes of the Spitzer spectrograph and with an aperture covering \~{}95\% of the total flux in the AKARI 2D spectra. The star formation rates (SFRs) derived from Br-alpha measured in the latter aperture agree well with SFRs(LIR), when the dust extinction correction is adopted based on the 9.7um absorption feature. Together with the Spitzer spectra, we are able to compare the 3.3 and 6.2um PAH features, the two most commonly used near/mid-IR indicators of starburst (SB) or active galactic nucleus (AGN) dominated galaxies. We find that the 3.3 and 6.2um PAH EQWs do not follow a linear correlation and at least 1/3 of galaxies classified as AGN-dominated using 3.3um PAH are classified as starbursts based on 6.2um PAH. These galaxies have a bluer continuum slope than galaxies that are indicated to be SB-dominated by both PAH features. The bluer continuum emission suggests that their continuum is dominated by stellar emission rather than hot dust. We also find that the median Spitzer spectra of these sources are remarkably similar to the pure SB-dominated sources indicated by high PAH EQWs in both 3.3 and 6.2um. We propose a revised SB/AGN diagnostic diagram using 2-5um data. We also use the AKARI and Spitzer spectra to examine the performance of our new diagnostics and to estimate 3.3um PAH fluxes using the JWST photometric bands in 0$\lt$z$\lt$5. Of the known PAH features and mid-IR high ionization emission lines used as SB/AGN indicators, only the 3.3um PAH feature is observable with JWST at z$\gt$3.5, because the rest of the features at longer wavelengths fall outside the JWST wavelength coverage.},

  abstract      = {We present ALMA observations of the mid-J 12CO emission from six single-dish selected 870-micron sources in the Extended Chandra Deep Field-South (ECDFS) and UKIDSS Ultra-Deep Survey (UDS) fields. These six single-dish submillimetre sources were selected based on previous ALMA continuum observations, which showed that each comprised a blend of emission from two or more individual submillimetre galaxies (SMGs), separated on 5--10 arcsec scales. The six single-dish submillimetre sources targeted correspond to a total of 14 individual SMGs, of which seven have previously-measured robust optical/near-infrared spectroscopic redshifts, which were used to tune our ALMA observations. We detect CO(3-2) or CO(4-3) at z=2.3--3.7 in seven of the 14 SMGs, and in addition serendipitously detect line emission from three gas-rich companion galaxies, as well as identify four new 3.3-mm selected continuum sources in the six fields. Joint analysis of our CO spectroscopy and existing data suggests that 64 $\backslash$pm 18\% of the SMGs in blended submillimetre sources are unlikely to be physically associated. However, three of the SMG fields (50\%) contain new, serendipitously-detected CO-emitting (but submillimetre-faint) sources at similar redshifts to the 870-micron selected SMGs we targeted. These data suggest that the SMGs inhabit overdense regions, but that these are not sufficiently overdense on \~{}100 kpc scales to influence the source blending given the short lifetimes of SMGs. We find that 21 $\backslash$pm 12\% of SMGs have spatially-distinct and kinematically-close companion galaxies (\~{}8--150 kpc and $\lt$\~{}300 km/s), which may have enhanced their star-formation via gravitational interactions.},

These 3,740 $z \sim$ 4 galaxies are selected from broad-band imaging in nine photometric bands over 18 deg$^2$ in the $\backslash$textit$\{$Spitzer$\}$/HETDEX Exploratory Large Area Survey (SHELA) field. The large area and moderate depth of our survey provide a unique view of the intersection between the bright end of the galaxy UV luminosity function (M$\_{AB}\lt-$22) and the faint end of the AGN UV luminosity function. We do not separate AGN-dominated galaxies from star-formation-dominated galaxies, but rather fit both luminosity functions simultaneously. These functions are best fit with a double power-law (DPL) for both the galaxy and AGN components, where the galaxy bright-end slope has a power-law index of $-3.80\pm0.10$, and the corresponding AGN faint-end slope is $\alpha\_{AGN} = -1.49^{+0.30}\_{-0.21}$. We cannot rule out a Schechter-like exponential decline for the galaxy UV luminosity function, and in this scenario the AGN luminosity function has a steeper faint-end slope of $-2.08^{+0.18}\_{-0.11}$. Comparison of our galaxy luminosity function results with a representative cosmological model of galaxy formation suggests that the molecular gas depletion time must be shorter, implying that star formation is more efficient in bright galaxies at $z=4$ than at the present day. If the galaxy luminosity function does indeed have a power-law shape at the bright end, the implied ionizing emissivity from AGNs is not inconsistent with previous observations. However, if the underlying galaxy distribution is Schechter, it implies a significantly higher ionizing emissivity from AGNs at this epoch.},

  abstract      = {We fit theoretical models to the emission-line spectra of 2766 Seyfert galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The model line fluxes are derived by `mixing' photoionization model predictions of active galactic nucleus (AGN) narrow line region (NLR) emission and HII region emission. The observed line fluxes in each spectrum were directly compared to the grid of mixed models using the Bayesian parameter estimation code NebulaBayes, thereby measuring the degree of mixing in each spectrum for the first time. We find that the majority of the Balmer line emission in the majority of Seyfert-classified SDSS spectra arises from contaminating HII regions within the fixed-size aperture. Even for spectra with log [OIII]/Hb $\gtrsim 0.9$, a median of \~{}30\% of the Balmer flux arises in HII regions. We show that the results are qualitatively insensitive to the assumed Seyfert ionizing continuum, and that ionizing spectra with a peak energy of E\_peak \~{} 40-50 eV produce the most plausible distributions of mixing fractions. The analysis cleanly quantifies how the starburst - AGN `mixing fraction' increases on the BPT diagram for SDSS galaxies. Apart from the mixing fraction, the models also vary with the ionization parameter in the NLR, the gas pressure, and the metallicity. Measurements for the metallicity in particular will be presented in a companion paper.},

  abstract      = {Although giant clumps of stars are crucial to galaxy formation and evolution, the most basic demographics of clumps are still uncertain, mainly because the definition of clumps has not been thoroughly discussed. In this paper, we study the basic demographics of clumps in star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at 0.5$\lt$z$\lt$3, using our proposed physical definition that UV-bright clumps are discrete star-forming regions that individually contribute more than 8\% of the rest-frame UV light of their galaxies. Clumps defined this way are significantly brighter than the HII regions of nearby large spiral galaxies, either individually or blended, when physical spatial resolution and cosmological dimming are considered. Under this definition, we measure the fraction of SFGs that contain at least one off-center clump (Fclumpy) and the contributions of clumps to the rest-frame UV light and star formation rate of SFGs in the CANDELS/GOODS-S and UDS fields, where our mass-complete sample consists of 3239 galaxies with axial ratio q$\gt$0.5. The redshift evolution of Fclumpy changes with the stellar mass (M*) of the galaxies. Low-mass (log(M*/Msun)$\lt$9.8) galaxies keep an almost constant Fclumpy of about 60\% from z\~{}3.0 to z\~{}0.5. Intermediate-mass and massive galaxies drop their Fclumpy from 55\% at z\~{}3.0 to 40\% and 15\%, respectively, at z\~{}0.5. We find that (1) the trend of disk stabilization predicted by violent disk instability matches the Fclumpy trend of massive galaxies; (2) minor mergers are a viable explanation of the Fclumpy trend of intermediate-mass galaxies at z$\lt$1.5, given a realistic observability timescale; and (3) major mergers are unlikely responsible for the Fclumpy trend in all masses at z$\lt$1.5. The clump contribution to the rest-frame UV light of SFGs shows a broad peak around galaxies with log(M*/Msun)\~{}10.5 at all redshifts, possibly linked to the molecular gas fraction of the galaxies.

  abstract      = {UV observations in the local universe have uncovered a population of early-type galaxies with UV flux consistent with low-level recent or ongoing star formation. We present resolved UV-optical photometry of a sample of 19 SDSS early-type galaxies at z\~{}0.1 drawn from the sample originally selected by Salim {\amp} Rich (2010) to lie in the bluer part of the green valley in the UV-optical color-magnitude diagram as measured by GALEX. Utilizing high-resolution HST far-UV imaging provides unique insight into the distribution of UV light in these galaxies, which we call ``extended star-forming early-type galaxies'' (ESF-ETGs) because of extended UV emission that is indicative of recent star formation. The UV-optical color profiles of all ESF-ETGs show red centers and blue outer parts. Their outer colors require the existence of a significant underlying population of older stars in the UV-bright regions. Analysis of stacked SDSS spectra reveals weak LINER-like emission in their centers. Using a cross-matched SDSS DR7/GALEX GR6 catalog, we search for other green valley galaxies with similar properties to these ESF-ETGs and estimate that \~{}13\% of dust-corrected green valley galaxies of similar stellar mass and UV-optical color are likely ESF-candidates, i.e., ESF-ETGs are not rare. Our results are consistent with star formation that is gradually declining in existing disks, i.e., the ESF-ETGs are evolving onto the red sequence for the first time, or with rejuvenated star formation due to accreted gas in older disks provided that the gas does not disrupt the structure of the galaxy and the resulting star formation is not too recent and bursty. ESF-ETGs may typify an important subpopulation of galaxies that can linger in the green valley for up to several Gyrs, based on their resemblance to nearby gas-rich green valley galaxies with low-level ongoing star formation.

  abstract      = {We present a study of the young population in the starburst galaxy NGC 253. In particular, we focused our attention on searching young star groups, obtaining their main properties and studying their hierarchical organization. For this task, we used multiband images and their corresponding photometric data obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys of the Hubble Space Telescope (ACS/HST). We have first derived the absorption affecting the different regions of the galaxy. Then, we applied an automatic and objective searching method over the corrected data in order to detect young star groups. We complemented this result with the construction of the stellar density map for the blue young population. A statistical procedure to decontaminate the photometric diagrams from field stars was applied over the detected groups and we estimated their fundamental parameters. As a result, we built a catalog of 875 new identified young groups with their main characteristics, including coordinates, sizes, estimated number of members, stellar densities, luminosity function (LF) slopes and galactocentric distances. We observed these groups delineate different structures of the galaxy, and they are the last step in the hierarchical way in which the young population is organized. From their size distribution, we found they have typical radius of $\sim 40 - 50$ pc. These values are consistent with those ones found in others nearby galaxies. We estimated a mean value of the LF slope of 0.21 and an average density of 0.0006 stars/pc$^3$ for the identified young groups taking into account stars earlier than B6.},

All 12 systems lie in the predicted redshift range for finding fossils in mid brightest group galaxy (BGG) assembly, and all show complex merging environments at their centers. None of these progenitors had archival X-ray data, and many were lacking high resolution optical data making precision photometry extremely difficult. Here, we present Chandra and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) snapshots of eight of these strong lensing fossil progenitors at varying stages of evolution. We find that our lensing progenitors exhibit higher than expected X-ray luminosities and temperatures consistent with previously observed non-lensing fossil systems. More precise galaxy luminosity functions are generated which strengthen past claims that progenitors are the transition phase between non-fossils and fossils. We also find evidence suggesting that the majority of differences between fossils and non-fossils lie in their BGGs and that fossil systems may themselves be a phase of galaxy system evolution and not a separate class of object.},

  abstract      = {Stellar kinematics provide insights into the masses and formation histories of galaxies. At high redshifts, spatially resolving the stellar kinematics of quiescent galaxies is challenging due to their compact sizes. Using deep near-infrared spectroscopy, we have measured the resolved stellar kinematics of four quiescent galaxies at z=1.95-2.64, introduced in Paper I, that are gravitationally lensed by galaxy clusters. Analyses of two of these have previously been reported individually by Newman et al. and Toft et al., and for the latter we present new observations. All four galaxies show significant rotation and can be classified as ``fast rotators.'' In the three systems for which the lensing constraints permit a reconstruction of the source, we find that all are likely to be highly flattened (intrinsic ellipticities of $\approx0.75-0.85$) disk-dominated galaxies with rapid rotation speeds of $V\_{\rm max}=290-352$ km/s and predominantly rotational support, as indicated by the ratio $(V/\sigma)\_{R\_e}=1.7-2.3$. Compared to coeval star-forming galaxies of similar mass, the quiescent galaxies have smaller $V/\sigma$. Given their high masses $M\_{\rm dyn} \gtrsim 2\times10^{11} M\_{\odot}$, we argue that these galaxies are likely to evolve into ``slow rotator'' elliptical galaxies whose specific angular momentum is reduced by a factor of 5-10. This provides strong evidence for merger-driven evolution of massive galaxies after quenching. Consistent with indirect evidence from earlier morphological studies, our small but unique sample suggests that the kinematic transformations that produced round, dispersion-supported elliptical galaxies were not generally coincident with quenching. Such galaxies probably emerged later via mergers that increased their masses and sizes while also eroding their rotational support.},

  abstract      = {Quiescent galaxies at $z \gtrsim 2$ are compact and have weak or absent emission lines, making it difficult to spatially resolve their kinematics and stellar populations using ground-based spectroscopy. Gravitationally lensed examples provide a promising route forward, but such objects are very rare. We describe a search in the fields of 232 galaxy clusters that has uncovered five bright ($H\_{\rm AB} \lt 20$) lensed galaxies with red near-infrared colors. These include MRG-M0138, the brightest lensed galaxy known in the near-infrared. Analysis of near-infrared spectra and multiband photometry confirms that all are quiescent galaxies at z=1.95-2.64 with stellar ages of 0.5-1.4 Gyr (corresponding to formation epochs $z\_{\rm form} \simeq 3-4$) and stellar masses of $10^{11.6-12.8} \mu^{-1} M\_{\odot}$, where $\mu$ is the magnification. In three cases we derive lens models and reconstruct the source structure; these galaxies are massive ($M\_* \gtrsim 10^{11.0} M\_{\odot}$) and follow the mass--size relation defined by unlensed samples. In two of these three galaxies, the main structural component is an inclined disk. Weak emission lines are detected in four of five galaxies with high ratios [NII]/H$\alpha$\~{}2-6 that are inconsistent with a star formation origin. Based on the line ratios, the H$\alpha$ equivalent widths, and the distribution and kinematics of the gas, we infer that shocks are likely present in at least two galaxies and could be present in all of the line emitters. We speculate that these could be analogs of local galaxies in which AGN jet-driven outflows are thought to heat the interstellar medium and suppress star formation. In further papers we will present spatially resolved measurements of the stellar populations and kinematics of this unique sample.},

We measure very high column densities of atomic and molecular hydrogen, with log N(HI,H$\_2$)$\simeq$21.8,21.3. This is the highest H$\_2$ column density ever measured in an intervening damped Lyman-alpha system but we do not detect CO, implying log N(CO)/N(H$\_2$) $\lt$ -7.8, which could be due to a low metallicity of the cloud. From the metal absorption lines, we derive the metallicity to be Z $\simeq$ 0.15 Z$\_{\odot}$ and determine the amount of dust by measuring the induced extinction of the background quasar light, A$\_V$ $\simeq$ 0.4. We also detect Ly-$\alpha$ emission at the same redshift, with a centroid located at a most probable impact parameter of only $\rho\,\simeq$ 1.4 kpc. We argue that the line of sight is therefore likely passing through the ISM of a galaxy as opposed to the CGM. The relation between the surface density of gas and that of star formation seems to follow the global empirical relation derived in the nearby Universe although our constraints on the star formation rate and on the galaxy extent remain too loose to be conclusive. We study the transition from atomic to molecular hydrogen using a theoretical description based on the microphysics of molecular hydrogen. We use the derived chemical properties of the cloud and physical conditions (T$\_k\,\simeq$90 K and n$\simeq$250 cm$^{-3}$ derived through the excitation of H$\_2$ rotational levels and neutral carbon fine structure transitions to constrain the fundamental parameters that govern this transition. By comparing the theoretical and observed HI column densities, we are able to bring an independent constraint on the incident UV flux, which we find to be in agreement with that estimated from the observed star formation rate.},

The photoionization models were built assuming a Power Law (associated with the presence of an AGN), a Direct Collapse Black Hole (DCBH), and Population II stars for the ionizing source. The resulting models were then compared with observational emission-line ratios in six diagnostic diagrams to produce a spectral classification of the sample. We found that CR7 (clump C), HSCJ233408+004403 and COSY probably have a non thermal ionizing source (AGN or DCBH) while the RXC J2248.7-4431-ID3 and A1703-zd6 seem to host a stellar cluster. Detailed photoionization models were constructed to reproduce observational emission line ratios of the sample of LAEs, and to derive chemical abundances and number of ionizing photons $Q(\rm H)$ of these objects. From these models, we found metallicities in the range $(Z/Z\_{\odot})=0.1-0.5$ and $\log Q(\rm H) \: \gt \: 53$. Values for C/O abundance ratio derived for the LAEs seem to be consistent with those derived for local star forming objects with similar metallicities, while an overabundance of N/O was found for most of the LAEs.},

In fact, the presence of a weak AGN configures as a natural scenario in order to explain the observed spectral properties of such high-$z$ objects in terms of a continuum slope distribution rather than altered infrared excesses, due to the different shape of the AGN continuum emission with respect to quiescent galaxies. To this aim, we directly compare the infrared-to-ultraviolet properties of high-redshift galaxies to those of known categories of AGN (quasars and Seyferts). We also infer the characteristics of their possible X-ray emission. We find a strong similarity between the spectral shapes and luminosity ratios of AGN with the corresponding properties of such galaxies. In addition, we derive expected X-ray fluxes that are compatible with energetics from AGN activity. We conclude that a moderate AGN contribution to the UV emission of such high-$z$ objects is a valid alternative to explain their spectral properties. Even the presence of an active nucleus in each source would not violate the expected quasar statistics. Furthermore, we suggest that the observed similarities between anomalous star-forming galaxies and quasars may provide a benchmark for future theoretical and observational studies on the galaxy population in the early Universe.},

  abstract      = {With a total integration time of 168 hours and a narrowband (NB) filter tuned to Lyman alpha at z = 8.8, the UltraVISTA survey has set out to find some of the most distant galaxies, on the verge of the Epoch of Reionization. Previous calculations of the expected number of detected Lya-emitting galaxies (LAEs) at this redshift did not explicitly take into account the radiative transfer (RT) of Lya. In this work we combine a theoretical model for the halo mass function with numerical results from high-res cosmological hydrosimulations with LyC+Lya RT, assessing the visibility of LAEs residing in these halos. Uncertainties such as cosmic variance and the anisotropic escape of Lya are taken into account, and it is predicted that once the survey has finished, the probabilities of detecting none, one, or more than one are \~{}90\%, \~{}10\%, and \~{}1\%; a significantly smaller success rate compared to earlier predictions, due to the combined effect of a highly neutral IGM scattering Lya to such large distances from the galaxy that they fall outside the observational aperture, and to the actual depth of the survey being less than predicted. Because the IGM affects NB and broadband (BB) magnitudes differently, we argue for a relaxed color selection criterion of NB - BB \~{} +0.85. But since the flux is continuum-dominated, even if a galaxy is detectable in the NB its probability of being selected as a NB excess object is $\lt$\~{}35\%. Various properties of galaxies at this redshift are predicted, e.g. UV and Lya LFs, M*-Mh relation, spectral shape, optimal aperture, and the anisotropic escape of Lya through both a dusty ISM and a partly neutral IGM. Finally, we describe and publish a fast numerical code for adding numbers with asymmetric uncertainties (``x\_$\{$-sigma\_1$\}$\^{}$\{$+sigma\_2$\}$'') proving to be significantly better than the standard, but wrong, way of adding upper and lower uncertainties in quadrature separately.},

  abstract      = {Detections of the cross correlation signal between the 21cm signal during reionization and high-redshift Lyman Alpha emitters (LAEs) are subject to observational uncertainties which mainly include systematics associated with radio interferometers and LAE selection. These uncertainties can be reduced by increasing the survey volume and/or the survey luminosity limit, i.e. the faintest detectable Lyman Alpha (Ly$\alpha$) luminosity. We use our model of high-redshift LAEs and the underlying reionization state to compute the uncertainties of the 21cm-LAE cross correlation function at $z\simeq6.6$ for observations with SKA1-Low and LAE surveys with $\Delta z=0.1$ for three different values of the average IGM ionization state ($\langle\chi\_\mathrm{HI}\rangle$=0.1, 0.25, 0.5). At $z\simeq6.6$, we find SILVERRUSH type surveys, with a field of view of 21 deg$^2$ and survey luminosity limits of $L\_\alpha\geq7.9\times10^{42}$erg\~{}s$^{-1}$, to be optimal to distinguish between an inter-galactic medium (IGM) that is 50\%, 25\% and 10\% neutral, while surveys with smaller fields of view and lower survey luminosity limits, such as the 5 and 10 deg$^2$ surveys with WFIRST, can only discriminate between a 50\% and 10\% neutral IGM.},

The model is used to explore the processes that drive star formation in different types of galaxies as a function of stellar mass and redshift. We find that most z = 2-4 star-forming galaxies with M$_{*}$ $\gt$ 10$^{10}$ M$_{⊙}$ evolve into red-sequence galaxies. Also, most of the massive galaxies on the red sequence today have passed through a phase of intense star formation at z $\gt$ 2. Specifically, {\tilde}90 per cent of today's red galaxies with M$_{*}$ $\gt$ 10$^{11}$ M$_{⊙}$ were fed during this phase by cold streams including minor mergers. Gas-rich major mergers are rare and the effects of merger-driven starbursts are ephemeral. On the other hand, major mergers are important in powering the most extreme starbursts. Gas-rich mergers also explain the tail of intermediate-mass red galaxies that form relatively late, after the epoch of peak star formation. In two-thirds of the currently red galaxies that had an intense star formation event at z $\lt$ 1, this event was triggered by a merger.},

  abstract      = {Massive Ultracompact Galaxies (MUGs) are common at z=2-3, but very rare in the nearby Universe. Simulations predict that the few surviving MUGs should reside in galaxy clusters, whose large relative velocities prevent them from merging, thus maintaining their original properties (namely stellar populations, masses, sizes and dynamical state). We take advantage of the high-completeness, large-area spectroscopic GAMA survey, complementing it with deeper imaging from the KiDS and VIKING surveys. We find a set of 22 bona-fide MUGs, defined as having high stellar mass ($\gt$8x10\^{}10 M\_Sun) and compact size (R\_e$\lt$2 Kpc) at 0.02 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 0.3. An additional set of 7 lower-mass objects (6x10\^{}10 $\lt$ M\_star/M\_Sun $\lt$ 8x10\^{}10) are also potential candidates according to typical mass uncertainties. The comoving number density of MUGs at low redshift (z $\lt$ 0.3) is constrained at $(1.2\pm 0.4)x 10^-6 Mpc^-3, consistent with galaxy evolution models. However, we find a mixed distribution of old and young galaxies, with a quarter of the sample representing (old) relics. MUGs have a predominantly early/swollen disk morphology (Sersic index 1\ltn\lt2.5) with high stellar surface densities (\ltSigma\_e\gt ~ 10^10 M\_Sun Kpc^-2). Interestingly, a large fraction feature close companions -- at least in projection -- suggesting that many (but not all) live in the central regions of groups. Halo masses show these galaxies inhabit average-mass groups. As MUGs are found to be almost equally distributed among environments of different masses, their relative fraction is higher in more massive overdensities, matching the expectations that some of these galaxies fell in these regions at early times. However, there must be another channel leading some of these galaxies to an abnormally low merger history because our sample shows a number of objects that do not inhabit particularly dense environments.

Our model includes a detailed treatment for the chemical enrichment from dying stars, core-collapse supernovae (both Type II and hypernovae) and Type Ia supernovae. At redshift $z=0$, we create a catalogue of $526$ galaxies, among which we determine $80$ early-type galaxies. From the analysis of our simulations, we find [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] relations similar to the Galactic bulge. We also find that, in the oldest galaxies, Type Ia supernovae start to contribute at higher [Fe/H] than in the youngest ones. On the average, early-type galaxies with larger stellar masses (and, equivalently, higher stellar velocity dispersions) have higher [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios, at fixed [Fe/H]. This is qualitatively consistent with the recent observations of Sybilska et al., but quantitatively there are mismatches, which might require stronger feedback, sub-classes of Type Ia Supernovae, or a variable initial mass function to address.},

We use these data to estimate galaxy sizes, obtaining results similar to those from studies with the Hubble Space Telescope, though we find a higher fraction of compact star forming galaxies at $z\gt2$. To disentangle the star-forming galaxies from active galactic nuclei (AGN), we use multiwavelength data from surveys in the optical and infrared, including far-infrared data from Herschel, as well as new radio continuum data from the Australia Telescope Compact Array and Very Large Array. We identify ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at $z \sim 1-3$, which consist of a combination of pure starburst galaxies and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)/starburst composites. The ULIRGs show signs of recent merger activity, such as highly disturbed morphologies and include a rare candidate triple AGN. We find that AGN tend to reside in hosts with smaller scale sizes than purely star-forming galaxies of similar infrared luminosity.

  abstract      = {We investigate the properties of galaxies as they shut off star formation over the 4 billion years surrounding peak cosmic star formation. To do this we categorize $\sim7000$ galaxies from $1\ltz\lt4$ into $90$ groups based on the shape of their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and build composite SEDs with $R\sim 50$ resolution. These composite SEDs show a variety of spectral shapes and also show trends in parameters such as color, mass, star formation rate, and emission line equivalent width. Using emission line equivalent widths and strength of the 4000$\backslash$AA$\backslash$ break, $D(4000)$, we categorize the composite SEDs into five classes: extreme emission line, star-forming, transitioning, post-starburst, and quiescent galaxies. The transitioning population of galaxies show modest H$\alpha$ emission ($EW\_{\rm REST}\sim40$$\backslash$AA) compared to more typical star-forming composite SEDs at $\log\_{10}(M/M\_\odot)\sim10.5$ ($EW\_{\rm REST}\sim80$$\backslash$AA). Together with their smaller sizes (3 kpc vs. 4 kpc) and higher S$\backslash$'ersic indices (2.7 vs. 1.5), this indicates that morphological changes initiate before the cessation of star formation. The transitional group shows a strong increase of over one dex in number density from $z\sim3$ to $z\sim1$, similar to the growth in the quiescent population, while post-starburst galaxies become rarer at $z\lesssim1.5$. We calculate average quenching timescales of 1.6 Gyr at $z\sim1.5$ and 0.9 Gyr at $z\sim2.5$ and conclude that a fast quenching mechanism producing post-starbursts dominated the quenching of galaxies at early times, while a slower process has become more common since $z\sim2$.},

The central galaxy contains $1.9\times 10^{10}~M\_{\odot}$ of molecular gas. The molecular gas morphology is complex and disturbed, showing no evidence for a rotationally-supported structure in equilibrium. $80\\%$ of the gas is situated within the central 5 kpc of the galactic center, while the remaining gas is located in a 20 kpc long filament. The cold gas has likely condensed out of the hot atmosphere. The filament is oriented along the edge of a putative X-ray cavity, suggesting that AGN activity has stimulated condensation. This is enegetically feasible, although the morphology is not as conclusive as systems whose molecular filaments trail directly behind buoyant radio bubbles. The velocity gradient along the filament is smooth and shallow. It is only consistent with free-fall if it lies within $20^{\circ}$ of the plane of the sky. The abundance of clusters with comparably low velocities suggests that the filament is not free-falling. Both the central and filamentary gas are coincident with bright UV emission from ongoing star formation. Star formation near the cluster core is consistent with the Kennicutt-Schmidt law. The filament exhibits increased star formation surface densities, possibly resulting from either the consumption of a finite molecular gas supply or spatial variations in the CO-to-H$\_2$ conversion factor.},

We find that Paschen-to-Balmer line ratios saturate around a constant value corresponding to $A\_{\rm V}\sim$2-3 mag, while line to IR luminosity ratios suggest a large range of more extreme obscurations and appear to be uncorrelated to the former. This behavior is not consistent with standard attenuation laws derived for local and distant galaxies, while being remarkably consistent with observations of starburst cores in which young stars and dust are homogeneously mixed. This model implies $A\_{\rm V}=$2-30 mag attenuation to the center of starburst cores, with a median of \~{}9 mag (a factor of 4000). X-ray hardness ratios for 6 AGNs in our sample and column densities derived from observed dust masses and radio sizes independently confirm this level of attenuation. In these conditions observed optical/near-IR emission comes from surface regions, while inner starburst cores are invisible. We thus attribute the high [NII]/H$\alpha$ ratios to widespread shocks from accretion, turbulence and dynamic disturbances rather than to AGNs. The large range of optical depths demonstrates that substantial diversity is present within the starburst population, possibly connected to different merger phases or progenitor properties. The majority of our targets are, in fact, morphologically classified as mergers. We argue that the extreme obscuration provides in itself smoking gun evidence of their merger origin, and a powerful tool for identifying mergers at even higher redshifts.},

  abstract      = {We present a two-step method to simulate and study non-circular motions in strongly barred galaxies. The first step is to constrain the initial parameters using a Bayesian analysis of each galaxy's azimuthally averaged rotation curve, the 3.6 $\rm \mu m$ surface brightness, and the gas surface density. The second step is to generate equilibrium models using the GalactICS code and evolve them via GADGET-2. The bar strengths and mock velocity maps of the resulting snapshots are compared to observations in order to determine the best representation of the galaxy. We test our method on the unbarred galaxy NGC 3621 and the barred galaxies NGC 1300 and NGC 1530. NGC 3621 provides a validation of our method of generating initial conditions. NGC 1530 has an intermediate bar orientation that allows for a comparison to DiskFit. Finally NGC 1300 has a bar oriented parallel to the galaxy's major axis, where other algorithms tend to fail. Our models for NGC 3621 and NGC 1530 are comparable to those obtained using commonly available algorithms. Moreover, we have produced one of the first mass distribution models for NGC 1300.},

These objects were selected from deep optical imaging obtained with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array. Seven are new discoveries, while most of the others had been identified previously in visual surveys of deep photographic plates and more recent surveys. Few have previously been studied in detail. From the ACS images, we measure distances to the galaxies using both the tip of the red giant branch method and the surface brightness fluctuations method. We demonstrate that the two methods are consistent with each other in the regime where both can be applied. The distances to 15 out of 20 galaxies with stable measurements are consistent with that of the targeted group within errors. This suggests that assuming group membership based solely on projected proximity is \~{}75\% successful in this regime. The galaxies are nearly round, with a median axis ratio of 0.85, and visually resemble dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The objects have a range of sizes, from $R\_e$=0.4 kpc to $R\_e$=1.8 kpc, with a median of 1.0 kpc. They range in luminosity from $M\_V$=-11.4 to $M\_V$=-15.6, with a median of -12.4. Galaxies with $R\_e$\~{}1 kpc and $M\_V$\~{}-12 are fairly rare in the Local Group but we find many of them in this relatively small sample. Four of the objects fall in the class of ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs), with $R\_e$$\gt$1.5 kpc and $\mu\_{0,V}$$\gt$24 mag/arcsec\^{}2, including the recently identified dark matter deficient galaxy NGC1052-DF2.},

The spectacular lensing system consists of an edge-on foreground disk galaxy at $z$ = 0.22 and a nearly complete Einstein ring of an intrinsic ultra-luminous infrared galaxy at $z$ = 1.03. Is this high IR luminosity powered by pure star formation (SF) or also an active galactic nucleus (AGN)? Previous nebular line diagnostics indicate that it is star-formation dominated. We perform a 27-band multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution modeling (SED) including the new SOFIA/HAWC+ data to constrain the fractional AGN contribution to the total IR luminosity. The AGN fraction in the IR turns out to be negligible. In addition, J1429-0028 serves as a testbed for comparing SED results from different models/templates and SED codes (MAGPHYS, SED3FIT, and CIGALE). We stress that star formation history is the dominant source of uncertainty in the derived stellar mass (as high as a factor of $\sim$ 10) even in the case of extensive photometric coverage. Furthermore, the detection of a source at $z$ $\sim$ 1 with SOFIA/HAWC+ demonstrates the potential of utilizing this facility for distant galaxy studies including the decomposition of SF/AGN components, which cannot be accomplished with other current facilities.},

Dwarf multiples are defined as 2 or more dwarfs that have angular separations $\gt$ 55'', projected separations r$\_p \lt 150$ kpc and relative line-of-sight velocities $\Delta V\_{\rm LOS} \lt 150$ km/s. While the mock catalogs predict a factor of 2 more isolated dwarfs than observed in SDSS, the mean number of observed companions per dwarf is $N\_c \sim 0.04$, in good agreement with Illustris when accounting for SDSS sensitivity limits. Removing these limits in the mock catalogs predicts $N\_c\sim 0.06$ for future surveys (LSST, DESI), which will be complete to M$\_* = 2\times 10^8$ M$\_\odot$. The 3D separations of mock dwarf multiples reveal a contamination fraction of $\sim$40\% in observations from projection effects. Most isolated multiples are pairs; triples are rare and it is cosmologically improbable that bound groups of dwarfs with more than 3 members exist within the parameter range probed in this study. We find that $\lt$1\% of LMC-analogs in the field have an SMC-analog companion. The fraction of dwarf ``Major Pairs'' (stellar mass ratio $\gt$1:4) steadily increases with decreasing Primary stellar mass, whereas the cosmological ''Major Merger rate'' (per Gyr) has the opposite behaviour. We conclude that cosmological simulations can be reliably used to constrain the fraction of dwarf mergers across cosmic time.},

With the goal to investigate the role of cluster mergers and accretion on the radio galaxy population, we performed a multi-wavelength study of the BCGs and of the galaxies showing extended radio emission in the cluster complexes of Abell 3528 and Abell 3558. Our study is based on a sample of 12 galaxies. We observed the clusters with the GMRT at 235, 325 and 610 MHz, and with the VLA at 8.46 GHz. We complemented our study with the TGSS at 150 MHz, the SUMSS at 843 MHz and ATCA at 1380, 1400, 2380, and 4790 MHz data. Optical imaging with ESO-VST and mid-IR coverage with WISE are also available for the host galaxies. We found deep differences in the properties of the radio emission of the BCGs in the two cluster complexes. The BCGs in the A3528 complex and in A3556, which are relaxed cool-core objects, are powerful active radio galaxies. They also present hints of restarted activity. On the contrary, the BCGs in A3558 and A3562, which are well known merging systems, are very faint, or quiet, in the radio band. The optical and IR properties of the galaxies are fairly similar in the two complexes, showing all passive red galaxies. Our study shows remarkable differences in the radio properties of the BGCs, which we relate to the different dynamical state of the host cluster. On the contrary, the lack of changes between such different environments in the optical band suggests that the dynamical state of galaxy clusters does not affect the optical counterparts of the radio galaxies, at least over the life-time of the radio emission.},

We present a programme of ${\it Herschel}$ FIR spectroscopic observations with the SPIRE FTS and photometric observations with PACS, both on board ${\it Herschel}$, towards a sample of 45 gravitationally lensed, dusty starbursts across $z\sim 1-3.6$. In total, we detected 27 individual lines down to 3-$\sigma$, including nine $[\rm C{\small II}]$ 158-$\mu$m lines with confirmed spectroscopic redshifts, five possible $[\rm C{\small II}]$ lines consistent with their far-infrared photometric redshifts, and in some individual sources a few $[\rm O{\small III}]$ 88-$\mu$m, $[\rm O{\small III}]$ 52-$\mu$m, $[\rm O{\small I}]$ 145-$\mu$m, $[\rm O{\small I}]$ 63-$\mu$m, $[\rm N{\small II}]$ 122-$\mu$m, and OH 119-$\mu$m (in absorption) lines. To derive the typical physical properties of the gas in the sample, we stack all spectra weighted by their intrinsic luminosity and by their 500-$\mu$m flux densities, with the spectra scaled to a common redshift. In the stacked spectra, we detect emission lines of $[\rm C{\small II}]$ 158-$\mu$m, $[\rm N{\small II}]$ 122-$\mu$m, $[\rm O{\small III}]$ 88-$\mu$m, $[\rm O{\small III}]$ 52-$\mu$m, $[\rm O{\small I}]$ 63-$\mu$m, and the absorption doublet of OH at 119-$\mu$m, at high fidelity. We find that the average electron densities traced by the $[\rm N{\small II}]$ and $[\rm O{\small III}]$ lines are higher than the average values in local star-forming galaxies and ULIRGs, using the same tracers. From the $[\rm N{\small II}]/[\rm C{\small II}]$ and $[\rm O{\small I}]/[\rm C{\small II}]$ ratios, we find that the $[\rm C{\small II}]$ emission is likely dominated by the photo-dominated regions (PDR), instead of by ionised gas or large-scale shocks.},

It includes 177 nearby merging dwarf galaxies of stellar mass M$\_{*}$ $\lt$ 10$^{10}$M$\_{\sun}$ and redshifts z $\lt$ 0.02. These galaxies are selected by visual inspection of publicly available archival imaging from two wide-field optical surveys (SDSS III and the Legacy Survey), and they possess low surface brightness features that are likely the result of an interaction between dwarf galaxies. We list UV and optical photometric data which we use to estimate stellar masses and star formation rates. So far, the study of interacting dwarf galaxies has largely been done on an individual basis, and lacks a sufficiently large catalog to give statistics on the properties of interacting dwarf galaxies, and their role in the evolution of low mass galaxies. We expect that this public catalog can be used as a reference sample to investigate the effects of the tidal interaction on the evolution of star-formation, morphology/structure of dwarf galaxies. Our sample is overwhelmingly dominated by star-forming galaxies, and they are generally found significantly below the red-sequence in the color-magnitude relation. The number of early-type galaxies is only 3 out of 177. We classify them, according to observed low surface brightness features, into various categories including shells, stellar streams, loops, antennae or simply interacting. We find that dwarf-dwarf interactions tend to prefer the low density environment. Only 41 out of the 177 candidate dwarf-dwarf interaction systems have giant neighbors within a sky projected distance of 700 kpc and a line of sight radial velocity range $\pm$700 km/s and, compared to the LMC-SMC, they are generally located at much larger sky-projected distances from their nearest giant neighbor.},

We create UV color maps ((F148W$-$N245M) and (F148W$-$N263M)) to study the temperature morphology of young stellar complexes with the help of theoretical models. We identify several complexes with temperature T $\gt$ 17500 K which are likely to be the OB associations present in the galaxy. These complexes show good spatial correlation with the H$\alpha$ emitting regions, H$~$I distribution and HST detected hot stars. The hot star forming regions are found to be clumpy in nature and show a hierarchical structure, with sizes in the range of 4 - 50 pc, with a large number with sizes $\lt$ 10 pc. The south western part of the galaxy shows many hot star forming regions, high level of H$\alpha$ emission and low column density of H$~$I which altogether denote a vigorous recent star formation. WLM is likely to have a large fraction of low mass compact star forming regions with mass M $\lt 10^3 M\_{\odot}$, in agreement with the size and mass of the CO clouds. We estimate the star formation rate of WLM to be $\sim$ 0.008 $M\_{\odot}/yr$, which is similar to the average value measured for nearby dwarf irregular galaxies.},

We use the largest reference model Ref-L100N1504, a cubic cosmological volume of 100 comoving megaparsecs on a side, to identify and characterise these systems through cosmic time. The number density of ring galaxies in EAGLE is in broad agreement with the observations. The vast majority of ring galaxies identified in EAGLE (83 per cent) have an interaction origin, i.e., form when one or more companion galaxies drop-through a disk galaxy. The remainder (17 per cent) have very long-lived ring morphologies ($\gt$ 2 Gyr) and host strong bars. Ring galaxies are HI rich galaxies, yet display inefficient star formation activity and tend to reside in the green valley particularly at z $\gt$ 0.5. This inefficiency is mainly due to the low pressure and metallicity of their interstellar medium (ISM) compared with the ISM of similar star-forming galaxies. We find that the interaction(s) is responsible for decreasing the ISM pressure by causing the ISM gas to flow from the inner regions to the outer disk, where the ring feature forms. At a fixed radius, the star formation efficiency of ring galaxies is indistinguishable from their star-forming counterparts, and thus the main reason for their integrated lower efficiency is the different gas surface density profiles. Since galaxy morphologies are not used to tune the parameters in hydrodynamical simulations, the experiment performed here demonstrates the success of the current numerical models in EAGLE.},

Thanks to the large sample of slow rotators, Graham+18 showed that there is clear structure in the misalignment angle distribution, with two peaks at both $0^{\circ}$ and $90^{\circ}$ misalignment (characteristic of oblate and prolate rotation respectively). Here we invert the observed distribution from Graham+18. The large sample allows us to go beyond the known fact that slow rotators are weakly triaxial and to place useful constraints on their intrinsic triaxiality distribution (around $1R\_{\rm e}$) for the first time. The shape inversion is generally non-unique. However, we find that, for a wide set of model assumptions, the observed distribution clearly requires a dominant triaxial-oblate population. For some of our models, the data suggest a hint for a minor triaxial-prolate population, but a dominant prolate population is ruled out.},

The line brightness temperature ratio of $r\_{3,1}\approx 1.6$ relative to a Green Bank Telescope CO($J=1-0$) detection may be elevated by a combination of external heating of molecular clouds, differential lensing, and/or pointing errors.},

We detect CO emission in 12 of the galaxies at $\gt$4sigma significance, with molecular gas masses in the range 0.01-6x10\^{}8 Msol, as well as CO in absorption in the non-dominant group member galaxy NGC 5354. In total 21 of the 53 CLoGS dominant galaxies are detected in CO and we confirm our previous findings that they have low star formation rates (0.01-1 Msol/yr) but short depletion times ($\lt$1Gyr) implying rapid replenishment of their gas reservoirs. Comparing molecular gas mass with radio luminosity, we find that a much higher fraction of our group-dominant galaxies (60+-16\%) are AGN-dominated than is the case for the general population of ellipticals, but that there is no clear connection between radio luminosity and the molecular gas mass. Using data from the literature, we find that at least 27 of the 53 CLoGS dominant galaxies contain HI, comparable to the fraction of nearby non-cluster early type galaxies detected in HI and significantly higher that the fraction in the Virgo cluster. We see no correlation between the presence of an X-ray detected intra-group medium and molecular gas in the dominant galaxy, but find that the HI-richest galaxies are located in X-ray faint groups. Morphological data from the literature suggests the cold gas component most commonly takes the form of a disk, but many systems show evidence of galaxy-galaxy interactions, indicating that they may have acquired their gas through stripping or mergers. We provide improved molecular gas mass estimates for two galaxies previously identified as being in the centres of cooling flows, NGC 4636 and NGC 5846, and find that they are relatively molecular gas poor compared to our other detected systems.},

We confirm a new bright Ly$\alpha$ emitter, BDF2195, at the same redshift of BDF521, $z=7.008$, and at only $\sim$90 kpc physical distance from it, confirming that the BDF area is likely an overdense, reionized region. A quantitative assessment of the Ly$\alpha$ fraction shows that the number of detected bright emitters is much higher than the average found at z$\sim$7, suggesting a high Ly$\alpha$ transmission through the inter-galactic medium (IGM). However, the line visibility from fainter galaxies is at odds with this finding, since no Ly$\alpha$ emission is found in any of the observed candidates with $M\_{UV}\gt$-20.25. This discrepancy can be understood either if some mechanism prevents Ly$\alpha$ emission from fainter galaxies within the ionized bubbles from reaching the observer, or if faint galaxies are located outside the reionized area and bright LAEs are solely responsible for the creation of their own HII regions. A thorough assessment of the nature of the BDF region and of its sources of re-ionizing radiation will be made possible by JWST spectroscopic capabilities.},

  abstract      = {SBS0335-052E, one of the most metal-poor (Z \~{} 3-4\% Z$\_{\odot}$) HeII-emitter starbursts known in the nearby universe, is studied using optical VLT/MUSE spectroscopic and Chandra X-ray observations. We spatially resolved the spectral map of the nebular HeII$\lambda$4686 emission from which we derived for the first time the total HeII-ionizing energy budget of SBS0335-052E. The nebular HeII line is indicative of a quite hard ionizing spectrum with photon energies $\gt$ 4 Ryd, and is observed to be more common at high-z than locally. Our study rules out a significant contribution from X-ray sources and shocks to the HeII photoionization budget, indicating that the He$^{+}$ excitation is mainly due to hot stellar continua. We discovered a new WR knot, but we also discard single WR stars as the main responsible for the HeII ionization. By comparing observations with current models, we found that the HeII-ionization budget of SBS0335-052E can only be produced by either single, rotating metal-free stars or a binary population with Z \~{} 10$^{-5}$ and a 'top-heavy' IMF. This discrepancy between the metallicity of such stars and that of the HII regions in SBS0335-052E is similar to results obtained by Kehrig et al. (2015) for the very metal-deficient HeII-emitting galaxy IZw18. These results suggest that the HeII ionization is still beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art models. Extremely metal-poor, high-ionizing starbursts in the local universe, like SBS0335-052E, provide unique laboratories for exploring in detail the extreme conditions likely prevailing in the reionization era.},

  abstract      = {Interacting galaxies provide us with an excellent laboratory for studying a number of physical phenomena associated with these processes. In this paper, we present a spectroscopic and kinematic analysis of the interacting galaxy NGC 4656 and its companion Tidal Dwarf Galaxy (TDG) candidate, NGC 4656UV. Using Fabry-Perot and GMOS multi-slit data, we investigated the possible origin of NGC 4656UV. We found that NGC 4656UV has a low metallicity (12+log(O/H)$\sim$8.2) and it follows the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) for normal dwarf galaxies. For NGC 4656, we estimated a flat oxygen abundance gradient of $\beta$ = -0.027$\pm$0.029 dex kpc$^{-1}$, which suggests the presence of gas flows induced by gravitational interactions. By analysing radial velocity profiles and by fitting a kinematic model of the observed velocity field, we confirm the literature result that NGC 4656 consists of one single body instead of two objects. We estimated a dynamical mass of $6.8^{1.8}\_{-0.6}\times10^{9}$ M$\_{\odot}$ and R of 12.1 kpc from the kinematic model of NGC 4656. Although the observed velocity field is dominated by rotation at large scales (V$\_{max}$/$\sigma\gtrsim$2.8), important non-rotational motions are present at small scales. Based on these new results, and on previously published information, we propose that NGC 4656 and 4656UV are a pair of interacting galaxies. NGC 4656UV is a companion of NGC 4656 and it does not have a tidal origin. The interaction between the two could have triggered the star formation in NGC 4656UV and increased the star formation in the northeast side of NGC 4656.},

Traditional explanations invoke either $(i)$ intrinsic relations between spectral index and power, $(ii)$ environmental differences at high redshift, or $(iii)$ higher inverse Compton losses due to the increased photon energy density of the cosmic microwave background. In this paper we investigate whether the increased inverse Compton losses alone can cause the observed spectral index - redshift correlation by using spectral modelling of nearby radio galaxies to simulate high redshift equivalents. We then apply selection effects and directly compare the simulated radio galaxy sample with an observed sample with sufficient redshift coverage. We find excellent agreement between the two, implying that inverse Compton losses and selection effects alone can largely reproduce the observed spectral index - redshift correlation.},

  abstract      = {We use 85 pairs of high resolution LCDM cosmological simulations from the NIHAO project to investigate why in dwarf galaxies neutral hydrogen (HI) linewidths measured at 50\% of the peak flux W\_50 / 2 (from the hydrodynamical simulations) tend to underpredict the maximum circular velocity VmaxDMO (from the corresponding dark matter only simulations). There are two main contributing processes. 1) Lower mass galaxies are less rotationally supported. This is confirmed observationally from the skewness of linewidths in bins of HI mass in both ALFALFA and HIPASS observations. 2) The HI distributions are less extended (relative to the dark matter halo) in dwarf galaxies. Coupled to the lower baryon-to-halo ratio results in rotation curves that are still rising at the last measured data point, in agreement with observations from SPARC. Combining these two effects, in both simulations and observations lower mass galaxies have broader line profiles as expressed through W\_50 / W\_20. Additionally, mass loss driven by supernovae and projection effects (dwarf galaxies are in general not thin disks) further reduce the linewidths. The implied HI linewidth velocity function from NIHAO is in good agreement with observations in the nearby Universe of dwarf galaxies: W\_50 /2=10-80 km/s. The dark matter only slope of -2.9 is reduced to -1.0 in the hydro simulations. Future radio observations of unbiased samples with higher spatial resolution will enable stricter tests of the simulations, and thus of the LCDM model.},

This data set extends the current Chandra coverage of the 3CR extragalactic catalog up to redshift $z$=1.0. Our sample includes 22 sources consisting of one compact steep spectrum (CSS) source, three quasars (QSOs), and 18 FR\,II radio galaxies. As in our previous analyses, here we report the X-ray detections of radio cores and extended structures (i.e., knots, hotspots and lobes) for all sources in the selected sample. We measured their X-ray intensities in three energy ranges: soft (0.5--1 keV), medium (1--2 keV) and hard (2-7 keV) and we also performed standard X-ray spectral analysis for brighter nuclei. All radio nuclei in our sample have an X-ray counterpart. We also discovered X-ray emission associated with the eastern knot of 3CR\,154, with radio hotspots in 3CR\,41, 3CR\,54 and 3CR\,225B and with the southern lobe of 3CR\,107. Extended X-ray radiation around the nuclei 3CR\,293.1 and 3CR\,323 on a scale of few tens kpc was also found. X-ray extended emission, potentially arising from the hot gas in the intergalactic medium and/or due to the high energy counterpart of lobes, is detected for 3CR\,93, 3CR\,154, 3CR\,292 and 3CR\, 323 over a few hundreds kpc-scale. Finally, this work also presents an update on the state-of-the-art of Chandra and XMM-Newton observations for the entire 3CR sample.},

Star clusters are characterized by concentrations, masses, and formation rates, OB associations by mass and mass surface density, O stars by their numbers and near-ultraviolet absolute magnitudes, and HII regions by Halpha surface brightnesses. These characteristics are compared to surrounding galactic pressure, stellar mass density, HI surface density, and star formation rate surface density. We find no trend of cluster characteristics with environmental properties, implying that larger scale effects are more important in determining cluster characteristics or that rapid dynamical evolution erases memory of the initial conditions. On the other hand, the most massive OB associations are found at higher pressure and HI surface density, and there is a trend of higher HII region Halpha surface brightness with higher pressure, suggesting that a higher concentration of massive stars and gas are found preferentially in regions of higher pressure. At low pressures we find massive stars but not bound clusters and OB associations. We do not find evidence for an increase of cluster formation efficiency as a function of star formation rate density. However, there is an increase in the ratio of the number of clusters to number of O stars with pressure, perhaps reflecting an increase in clustering properties with star formation rate.},

  abstract    = {We present a study of the radio properties of the dominant early-type galaxies in 26 galaxy groups, the high-richness sub-sample of the Complete Local-volume Groups Sample (CLoGS). Combining new 610 MHz and 235 MHz observations of 21 groups from the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) with archival GMRT and Very Large Array (VLA) survey data, we find a high detection rate, with 92% of the dominant galaxies hosting radio sources. The sources have a wide range of luminosities, 10$^{20}$ $-$ 10$^{24}$ W/Hz in the 235 and 610 MHz bands. The majority (54%) are point-like, but 23% have radio jets, and another 15% are diffuse radio sources with no clear jet/lobe morphology. The spectral index of the detected radio sources ranges from very flat values of ~0.2 to typical radio synchrotron spectra of ~0.9 with only two presenting steep radio spectra with $\alpha_{235}^{610}$ > 1. We find that jet sources are more common in X-ray bright groups, with radio non-detections found only in X-ray faint systems. Radio point sources appear in all group environments irrespective of their X-ray properties or spiral fraction. We estimate the mechanical power (Pcav) of the jet sources in the X-ray bright groups to be 10$^{41}$ $-$ 10$^{43}$ erg/s, with the two large-scale jet systems (NGC 193 and NGC 4261) showing jet powers two orders of magnitude greater than the radiative losses from the cool cores of their groups. This suggests that central AGN are not always in balance with cooling, but may instead produce powerful periodical bursts of feedback heating.},

  abstract    = {Most of the galaxies in the Universe at present day are in groups, which are key to understanding the galaxy evolution. In this work we present a new deep mosaic of 1.2 x 1.0 square degrees of the group of galaxies centered on NGC 5018, acquired at the ESO VLT Survey Telescope. We use u, g, r images to analyse the structure of the group members and to estimate the intra-group light. Taking advantage of the deep and multiband photometry and of the large field of view of the VST telescope, we studied the structure of the galaxy members and the faint features into the intra-group space and we give an estimate of the intragroup diffuse light in the NGC 5018 group of galaxies. We found that ~ 41% of the total g-band luminosity of the group is in the form of intragroup light (IGL). The IGL has a (g - r) color consistent with those of other galaxies in the group, indicating that the stripping leading to the formation of IGL is ongoing. From the study of this group we can infer that there are at least two different interactions involving the group members: one between NGC 5018 and NGC 5022, which generates the tails and ring-like structures detected in the light, and another between NGC 5022 and MCG-03-34-013 that have produced the HI tail. A minor merging event also happened in the formation history of NGC 5018 that have perturbed the inner structure of this galaxy.},

  abstract      = {More than one hundred galaxy-scale strong gravitational lens systems have been found by searching the emission lines coming from galaxies with higher redshift than the foreground galaxies. Based on this spectroscopic-selection method, we introduce the Deep Residual Network (Resnet, one kind of deep Convolutional Neural Networks) to search the galaxy-Ly$\{$$\backslash$alpha$\}$ emitter (LAEs) lens candidates by recognizing the Ly$\{$$\backslash$alpha$\}$ emissions from the redshift of 2 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3 in the Data Release 12 (DR12) of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III). In our study, we first build a 28 layers Resnet model and then artificially synthesize 150,000 spectra, including 140,000 spectra without Ly$\{$$\backslash$alpha$\}$ emissions and 10,000 with Ly$\{$$\backslash$alpha$\}$ emissions, to train it. After 25 epochs training, We obtain a near-perfect test accuracy of 0.9954 for our model, and the corresponding loss is 0.0028. We then apply our Resnet model to our predictive data contained with 174 known lens candidates. Finally we obtain 1232 hits including 161 (92.5\%) of the 174 known candidates. Apart form the hits found in other works, our Resnet model also find 536 new hits. We then perform several subsequent selections to these 536 hits and present 6 most believable lens candidates in this paper.},

  abstract    = {We analyse an N-body simulation of the interaction of a Sagittarius-like dSph (Sgr) with the Milky Way (MW), looking for signatures which may be attributed to the orbital history of Sgr in the stellar-phase space volume around the Sun in light of the recent Gaia DR2 discoveries. In this simulation, Sgr excites coupled oscillations in the vertical and radial directions, a bar and bisymmetric spiral which quickly winds up over the last Gyr of its evolution. The repeated impacts of Sgr with the MW are qualitatively, and to a large degree quantitatively able to reproduce many of the recently uncovered features in the 6D Gaia samples presented in Katz et al. and Antoja et al. We find that the complex pattern in the velocity field is well described by a model with tightly wound tidally excited spirals from Sgr's impacts. This is the first N-body model able to explain so many of the features in the data on different scales in a consistent fashion. The failures of the models, such as the excess amplitudes of the signal compared to the data, call for the need of more detailed modeling through adapted numerical methods tailored to the Milky Way (using test particle and full N-body simulations) and its interaction with its principal perturber in the last Gyr. These should help us gain insight into the excitation of spiral arms, the bar and the mass-loss history of the Sgr dwarf. The successes presented here suggest that this goal is within reach.},

  abstract      = {Far-infrared and submillimeter wavelength surveys have now established the important role of dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) in the assembly of stellar mass and the evolution of massive galaxies in the Universe. The brightest of these galaxies have infrared luminosities in excess of 10$^{13}$ L$_{⊙}$ with implied star-formation rates of thousands of solar masses per year. They represent the most intense starbursts in the Universe, yet many are completely optically obscured. Their easy detection at submm wavelengths is due to dust heated by ultraviolet radiation of newly forming stars. When summed up, all of the dusty, star-forming galaxies in the Universe produce an infrared radiation field that has an equal energy density as the direct starlight emission from all galaxies visible at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths. The bulk of this infrared extragalactic background light emanates from galaxies as diverse as gas-rich disks to mergers of intense starbursting galaxies. Major advances in far-infrared instrumentation in recent years, both space-based and ground-based, has led to the detection of nearly a million DSFGs, yet our understanding of the underlying astrophysics that govern the start and end of the dusty starburst phase is still in nascent stage. This review is aimed at summarizing the current status of DSFG studies, focusing especially on the detailed characterization of the best-understood subset (submillimeter galaxies, who were summarized in the last review of this field over a decade ago, Blain et al., 2002), but also the selection and characterization of more recently discovered DSFG populations. We review DSFG population statistics, their physical properties including dust, gas and stellar contents, their environments, and current theoretical models related to the formation and evolution of these galaxies.},

The final disc-dominated galaxy is consistent with local disc scaling relations, such as the stellar-halo mass relation and the baryonic Tully-Fisher. The galaxy evolves from a compact, dispersion-dominated galaxy into a rotation-dominated but dynamically hot disc in about 0.5 Gyr (from z = 1.4 to 1.2). The disc dynamically cools down for the following 7 Gyr, as the gas velocity dispersion decreases over time, in agreement with observations. The primary cause of this slow evolution of velocity dispersion in this low-mass galaxy is stellar feedback. It is related to the decline in gas fraction, and to the associated gravitational disc instability, as the disc slowly settles from a global Toomre Q $\gt$ 1 turbulent disc to a marginally unstable disc (Q {\sime} 1).},

Measurements of galaxy rotation velocity V rot, which quantify ordered motions, and gas velocity dispersion {σ }g, which quantify disordered motions, are adopted from the DEEP2 and SIGMA surveys. This sample covers a continuous baseline in redshift over 0.1 < z < 2.5, spanning 10 Gyr. At low redshift, nearly all sufficiently massive star-forming galaxies are rotationally supported ({V}{rot}> {σ }g). By z = 2, 50% and 70% of galaxies are rotationally supported at low ({10}9{--}{10}10 {M}☉ ) and high ({10}10{--}{10}11 {M}☉ ) stellar mass, respectively. For {V}{rot} > 3 {σ }g, the percentage drops below 35% for all masses. From z = 2 to now, galaxies exhibit remarkably smooth kinematic evolution on average. All galaxies tend toward rotational support with time, and higher-mass systems reach it earlier. This is largely due to a mass-independent decline in {σ }g by a factor of 3 since z = 2. Over the same time period, V rot increases by a factor of 1.5 in low-mass systems but does not evolve at high mass. These trends in V rot and {σ }g are at a fixed stellar mass and therefore should not be interpreted as evolutionary tracks for galaxy populations. When populations are linked in time via abundance matching, {σ }g declines as before and V rot strongly increases with time for all galaxy populations, enhancing the evolution in {V}{rot}/{σ }g. These results indicate that z=2 is a period of disk assembly, during which strong rotational support is only just beginning to emerge.},

As diagnostics we use mass-to-light ratios in three passbands: the UV continuum at 280 nm, the H$\alpha$ emission line, and the FIR 24$\mu$-band. We include a study of inclination trends in the IR/UV ratio (``IRX'') and the IR/H$\alpha$ ratio. Our sample comprises a few hundred galaxies from the region around the clusters Abell 901/902 with deep data and inclinations measured from outer disks in Hubble Space Telescope images. As a novelty, the H$\alpha$- and separately the NII-emission are measured by tunable-filter imaging and encompass galaxies in their entirety. At galaxy stellar masses above log $M\_*/M\_\odot \gt 10$ we find trends in the UV and H$\alpha$ mass-to-light ratio that suggest an inclination-induced attenuation from face-on to edge-on of $\sim 1$ mag and $\sim 0.7$ mag in UV and H$\alpha$, respectively, implying that star-formation rates of edge-on galaxies would be underestimated by $\sim 2.5\times$ in UV and $\sim 2\times$ in H$\alpha$. We find the luminosities in UV and H$\alpha$ to be well correlated, but the optical depth of diffuse dust that causes inclination dependence appears to be lower for stars emitting at 280 nm than for gas clouds emitting Balmer lines. For galaxies with log $M\_*/M\_\odot \lt 9.7$, we find no measurable effect at $\gt0.1$ mag. The absence of an inclination dependence at 24$\mu$ confirms that the average galaxy is optically thin in the FIR.},

It consists of eight clusters and groups, with members numbering from a dozen to nearly a hundred, providing a broad range of environments for investigating the large-scale environmental effects on galaxy evolution. Here we examine the properties of 48 post-starburst galaxies in Cl 1604, comparing them to other galaxy populations in the same supercluster. Incorporating photometry from ground-based optical and near-infrared imaging, along with Spitzer mid-infrared observations, we derive stellar masses for all Cl 1604 members. The colors and stellar masses of the K+A galaxies support the idea that they are progenitors of red sequence galaxies. Their morphologies, residual star formation rates, and spatial distributions suggest that galaxy mergers may be the principal mechanism producing post-starburst galaxies. Interaction between galaxies and the dense intracluster medium (ICM) is also effective, but only in the cores of dynamically evolved clusters. The prevalence of post-starburst galaxies in clusters correlates with the dynamical state of the host cluster, as both galaxy mergers and the dense ICM produce post-starburst galaxies. We also investigate the incompleteness and contamination of K+A samples selected by means of H{$\delta$} and [O II] equivalent widths. K+A samples may be up to \~{}50\% incomplete due to the presence of LINERs/Seyferts, and up to \~{}30\% of K+A galaxies could have substantial star formation activity.},

This sample of eight star-forming galaxies at z\~{}2 selected among the most massive Herschel galaxies in the GOODS-South field is supplemented with eleven galaxies from the public data of the 1.3 mm survey of the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field. ALMA reveals systematically dense concentrations of dusty star-formation close to the center of the stellar component of the galaxies. We identify two different starburst regimes: (i) the classical population of starbursts located above the SFR-M* main sequence, with enhanced gas fractions and short depletion times and (ii) a sub-population of galaxies located within the scatter of the main sequence that experience compact star formation with depletion timescales typical of starbursts of \~{}150 Myr. In both starburst populations, the far infrared and UV are distributed in distinct regions and dust-corrected star formation rates estimated using UV-optical-NIR data alone underestimate the total star formation rate. Starbursts hidden in the main sequence show instead the lowest gas fractions of our sample and could represent the last stage of star-formation before they become passive. Being Herschel-selected, these main sequence galaxies are located in the high-mass end of the main sequence, hence we do not know whether these ``starbursts hidden in the main sequence'' also exist below 10\^{}11 Msun. Active galactic nuclei are found to be ubiquitous in these compact starbursts, suggesting that the triggering mechanism also feeds the central black hole or that the active nucleus triggers star formation.},

We have spectroscopically confirmed 17 member galaxies with 11 from CO and the remaining ones from H{$\alpha$}. The X-ray luminosity, stellar mass content, and velocity dispersion all point to a collapsed, cluster-sized dark matter halo with mass M $_{200c }$ = 10$^{13.9±0.2}$ M $_{⊙}$, making it the most distant X-ray-detected cluster known to date. Unlike other clusters discovered so far, this structure is dominated by star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the core with only 2 out of the 11 massive galaxies classified as quiescent. The star formation rate (SFR) in the 80 kpc core reaches {\tilde}3400 M $_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$ with a gas depletion time of {\tilde}200 Myr, suggesting that we caught this cluster in rapid build-up of a dense core. The high SFR is driven by both a high abundance of SFGs and a higher starburst fraction ({\tilde}25\%, compared to 3\%-5\% in the field). The presence of both a collapsed, cluster-sized halo and a predominant population of massive SFGs suggests that this structure could represent an important transition phase between protoclusters and mature clusters. It provides evidence that the main phase of massive galaxy passivization will take place after galaxies accrete onto the cluster, providing new insights into massive cluster formation at early epochs. The large integrated stellar mass at such high redshift challenges our understanding of massive cluster formation.},

After splitting green valley galaxies into two parts---a bluer green valley (green 1) and a redder one (green 2) and three stellar mass bins, we investigate the physical properties variation across the green valley region. Our main results are as following: (i) The percentages of pure bulge and bulge-dominated/elliptical galaxies increase gradually from blue cloud to red sequence while the percentages of pure disk and disk-dominated/spiral galaxies decrease gradually in all stellar mass bins and different environments; (ii) With the analysis of morphological and structural parameters (e.g., concentration (C) and the stellar mass surface density within the central 1Kpc ($\Sigma\_{1}$)), red galaxies show the most luminous and compact cores than both green valley and blue galaxies while blue galaxies show the opposite behavior in all stellar mass bins. (iii) A strong negative (positive) relationship between bulge-to-total light ratio (B/T) and specific star formation rate (sSFR) ($D\_{4000}$) is found from blue to red galaxies. Our results indicate that the growth of bulge plays an important role when the galaxies change from the blue cloud, to green valley, and to the red sequence.},

However, it is difficult to directly associate low-mass ETGs with gas-rich processes, because currently they are gas poor with no signs of ongoing star formation. We report a discovery of an ETG (SDSS J142055.01+400715.7) with Mstellar=10\^{}10 Msun that offers direct evidence for gas-rich merging as the origin of low-mass ETGs. The integrated properties of the galaxy are consistent with a typical low-mass ETG, but the outer and inner regions show distinct dispersion- and rotation-dominated kinematics, respectively. There are some tidal features surrounding the galaxy. These two facts suggest very recent galaxy merging. Furthermore, the inner disk harbors on-going star formation, indicating the merging to be gas rich. This type of galaxy is rare but it may be a demonstration of the role the transient phase of gas-rich merging plays in making a low-mass ETG.},

We find that these galaxies are diverse in their structures, with $\sim1/3$ of the targets being composed of close pairs, and span a wide range in sizes. At $1.5\ltz\lt2.5$, the sizes of both star-forming and quiescent galaxies are consistent with the extrapolation of the stellar mass-size relations determined at lower stellar masses. At $2.5\ltz\lt3.0$, however, we find evidence that quiescent galaxies are systematically larger than expected based on the extrapolation of the relation derived using lower stellar mass galaxies. We used the observed light profiles of the blended systems to decompose their stellar masses and investigate the effect of the close pairs on the measured number densities of very massive galaxies in the early universe. We estimate correction factors to account for close-pair blends and apply them to the observed stellar mass functions measured using ground-based surveys. Given the large uncertainties associated with this extreme population of galaxies, there is currently little tension between the (blending-corrected) number density estimates and predictions from theoretical models. Although we currently lack the statistics to robustly correct for close-pair blends, we show that this is a systematic effect which can reduce the observed number density of very massive galaxies by up to a factor of $\sim1.5$, and should be accounted for in future studies of stellar mass functions.},

  abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of the physical properties of \~{} 10$^{5}$ galaxies with measurable star formation in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By comparing physical information extracted from the emission lines with continuum properties, we build up a picture of the nature of star-forming galaxies at z $\lt$ 0.2. We develop a method for aperture correction using resolved imaging and show that our method takes out essentially all aperture bias in the star formation rate (SFR) estimates, allowing an accurate estimate of the total SFRs in galaxies. We determine the SFR density to be 1.915$^{+0.02}$$_{-0.01}$ (random)$^{+0.14}$$_{-0.42}$ (systematic) h$_{70}$10$^{-2}$ M$_{solar}$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ at z= 0.1 (for a Kroupa initial mass function) and we study the distribution of star formation as a function of various physical parameters. The majority of the star formation in the low-redshift Universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (10$^{10}$-10$^{11}$ M$_{solar}$), typically in high surface brightness disc galaxies. Roughly 15 per cent of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20 per cent occurs in starburst galaxies. By focusing on the SFR per unit mass we show that the present to past average SFR, the Scalo b-parameter, is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M$_{*}$ $\gt$ 10$^{10}$ M$_{solar}$. The volume averaged b parameter is 0.408$^{+0.005}$$_{-0.002}$ (random)$^{+0.029}$$_{-0.090}$ (systematic)h$^{-1}$$_{70}$. We use this value to constrain the star formation history of the Universe. For the concordance cosmology the present-day Universe is forming stars at at least 1/3 of its past average rate. For an exponentially declining cosmic star formation history this corresponds to a time-scale of 7$^{+0.7}$$_{-1.5}$ Gyr. In agreement with other work we find a correlation between b and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000-{\AA}break (D4000) and b. We discuss how D4000 can be used to estimate b parameters for high-redshift galaxies.},

  abstract      = {Ly$\alpha$ Emitters (LAEs) may represent an important galaxy population in the low mass regime. We present our deep narrowband imaging surveys in the COSMOS and ECDF-S fields and study the properties of LAEs at $z=2.23\pm0.03$. The narrowband surveys conducted at Magellan II telescope allow us to obtain a sample of 452 LAEs reaching a $5\sigma$ limiting magnitude of $\sim26$ mag. Our Ly$\alpha$ luminosity functions extend to $10^{41.8}$ erg s$^{-1}$ with steep faint-end slope. Using multi-wavelength ancillary data, especially the deep Spitzer/IRAC 3.6$\mu$m and 4.5$\mu$m photometric data, we obtained reliable stellar mass estimates for 130 IRAC-detected LAEs, spanning a range of $8 \lt {\rm log}(M\_\star/M\_\odot)\lt 11.5$. For the remaining IRAC-undetected LAEs, the median-stacked spectral energy distribution yields a stellar mass of ${\rm log}(M\_\star/M\_\odot)=7.97^{+0.05}\_{-0.07}$ and the rest-frame ultraviolet emission indicates a median star formation rate of ${\rm log} (SFR/M\_\odot$ yr$^{-1})=-0.14\pm0.35$. There are six LAEs detected by the Spitzer/MIPS 24$\mu$m or even Herschel far-infrared observations. Taking into account the six MIR/FIR detected LAEs, our LAEs cover a wide range in the star formation rate (${\rm 1\ltSFR\lt2000}$ M$\_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$). Although LAEs as a population are diverse in their stellar properties, they are mostly low-mass star-forming galaxies and follow the star formation main sequence relations or their extrapolations to the low-mass end, implying a normal star-forming nature of LAEs. The clustering analysis indicates that our LAEs reside in dark matter halos with ${\rm \lt\log(M\_{h}/M\_{\odot})\gt =10.8^{+0.56}\_{-1.1}}$, suggesting that they are progenitors of local Large Magellanic Cloud-like galaxies.},

  abstract      = {The halos of disk galaxies form a crucial connection between the galaxy disk and the intergalactic medium. Massive stars, HII regions, or dwarf galaxies located in the halos of galaxies are potential tracers of recent accretion and/or outflows of gas, and are additional contributors to the photon field and the gas phase metallicity. We investigate the nature and origin of a star-forming dwarf galaxy candidate located in the halo of the edge-on Virgo galaxy NGC 4634 with a projected distance of 1.4 kpc and a H$\alpha$ star formation rate of $\sim 4.7 \times 10^{-3} \text{M}\_\odot \text{yr}^{-1}$ in order to increase our understanding of these disk-halo processes. With optical long-slit spectra we measured fluxes of optical nebula emission lines to derive the oxygen abundance 12 + log(O/H) of an HII region in the disk of NGC 4634 and in the star-forming dwarf galaxy candidate. Abundances derived from optical long-slit data and from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) r-band data, H$\alpha$ data, Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) HI data, and photometry of SDSS and GALEX data were used for further analysis. With additional probes of the luminosity-metallicity relation in the $B$-band from the H$\alpha$-luminosity, the HI map, and the relative velocities, we are able to constrain a possible origin of the dwarf galaxy candidate. The high oxygen abundance (12 + log(O/H) $\approx$ 8.72) of the dwarf galaxy candidate leads to the conclusion that it was formed from pre-enriched material. Analysis of auxiliary data shows that the dwarf galaxy candidate is composed of material originating from NGC 4634. We cannot determine whether this material has been ejected tidally or through other processes, which makes the system highly interesting for follow up observations.},

  abstract      = {We present a SALT-RSS spectroscopic study of a sample of S0 galaxies established by Vaghmare et al. (2015) as having pseudobulges using a combination of photometric criteria. We extract the spectra of various regions along the galaxy major axis using standard long-slit spectroscopic reduction procedures and model the spectra using STARLIGHT to derive detailed star formation histories. The central spectra of galaxies without bars in our sample reveal a complex star formation history, which is consistent with the belief that pseudobulges have a history of star formation distributed over extended periods of time. The spectra of the unbarred galaxies contain strong emission lines such as H $\alpha$, indicating active star formation, which appears to be in contradiction with the expectation that S0 galaxies have been stripped of gas. In the case of the two barred galaxies in the sample, the spectrum is dominated by light from a much older stellar population. This seems to suggest an accelerated formation of the pseudobulge made possible by the action of the bar. One of these galaxies appears to have exhausted its reservoir of gas and thus has no signature of a recently formed population of stars while the other galaxy has managed to give rise to new stars through a recent funnelling action. We have also confirmed the influence of bars on the nature of the stellar population in a pseudobulge using an alternate sample based on the SDSS},

  abstract      = {Aims. With the aim of performing an analysis of the orientations of galaxy pair systems with respect to the underlying large-scale structure, we study the alignment between the axis connecting the pair galaxies and the host cosmic filament where the pair resides. In addition, we analyze the dependence of the amplitude of the alignment on the morphology of pair members as well as filament properties. Methods. We build a galaxy pair catalog requiring $r\_p \lt 100\kpc$ and $\Delta V \lt 500 \kms $ within redshift $z\lt0.1$ from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We divided the galaxy pair catalog taking into account the morphological classification by defining three pair categories composed by elliptical-elliptical (E-E), elliptical-spiral (E-S) and spiral-spiral (S-S) galaxies. We use a previously defined catalog of filaments obtained from SDSS and we select pairs located closer than $1\mpc$ from the filament spine, which are considered as members of filaments. For these pairs, we calculate the relative angle between the axis connecting each galaxy, and the direction defined by the spine of the parent filament. Results. We find a statistically significant alignment signal between the pair axes and the spine of the host filaments consistent with a relative excess of $ \sim$ 15$\backslash$\% aligned pairs. We obtain that pairs composed by elliptical galaxies exhibit a stronger alignment, showing a higher alignment signal for pairs closer than 200 $\kpc$ to the filament spine. In addition, we find that the aligned pairs are associated with luminous host filaments populated with a high fraction of elliptical galaxies. The findings of this work show that large scale structures play a fundamental role in driving galactic anisotropic accretion as induced by galaxy pairs exhibiting a preferred alignment along the filament direction.},

Quiescent galaxies have warm ionized gas showing line ratios similar to low-ionization nuclear emission line regions (LINER). The ionization mechanism for the gas is still an unsettled puzzle. Despite the uncertainty in the ionization mechanism, we argue that we can still infer certain gas phase abundance pattern from first principles. We show that the relative trend in N/O abundance can still be reliably measured based on [NII]6548,6583/[OII]3726,3729 and a direct measurement of the electron temperature. We construct a composite direct temperature tracer that is independent of extinction correction, by combining [OII] 3726,3729/[OII] 7320,7330 and [SII] 6716,6730/[SII] 4068,4076 and canceling out the effect of extinction, as these involve the easiest-to-detect auroral lines in quiescent galaxies. With theoretical modeling, we establish the calibration for N/O based on [NII]/[OII] and a temperature tracer. We apply this technique to quiescent galaxies in the nearby Universe and find they span a range of 0.35 dex in N/O ratio from 17-percentile to 83-percentiles of the whole distribution. These measurements can shed light on the chemical enrichment history of the warm ionized gas in quiescent galaxies.},

Our observations show that strong LyC emitters can have UV emission lines with a high equivalent width (e.g. EW(CIII])$=11.7 \pm 2.9 \AA$ rest-frame), although their equivalent widths should be reduced due to the loss of ionizing photons. The intrinsic ionizing photon production efficiency of J1154+2443 is high, $\log(\xi\_{\rm ion}^0)=25.56$ erg$^{-1}$ Hz, comparable to that of other recently discovered $z \sim 0.3-0.4$ LyC emitters. Combining our measurements and earlier determinations from the literature, we find a trend of increasing $\xi\_{\rm ion}^0$ with increasing CIII] 1909 equivalent width, which can be understood by a combination of decreasing stellar population age and metallicity. Simple ionization and density-bounded photoionization models can explain the main observational features including the UV spectrum of J1154+2443.},

Ensembles of dwarf galaxies are observed as sate{\shy}llites of more massive galaxies$^{ 6-9 }$, and there is observational$^{ 10 }$ and theoretical$^{ 11 }$ evidence to suggest that these satellites at redshift z{\thinsp}={\thinsp}0 were captured by the massive host halo as a group. However, the evolution of dwarf galaxies is highly susceptible to environment$^{ 12-14 }$, making these satellite groups imperfect probes of {$\Lambda$}CDM in the low-mass regime. Here we report one of the clearest examples yet of hierarchical structure formation at low masses: using deep multi-wavelength data, we identify seven isolated, spectroscopically confirmed groups of only dwarf galaxies. Each group hosts three to five known members, has a baryonic mass of \~{}4.4{\thinsp}{\times}{\thinsp}10$^{9}$ to 2{\thinsp}{\times}{\thinsp}10$^{10}$ solar masses (M $_{⊙}$), and requires a mass-to-light ratio of $\lt$100 to be gravitationally bound.

As direct observations at high redshift are difficult for a variety of reasons, one solution is to identify local proxies of this galaxy population. Starburst galaxies at low redshifts, however, generally are opaque to Lyman continuum photons. Small escape fractions of about 1 to 3 per cent, insufficient to ionize much surrounding gas, have been detected only in three low-redshift galaxies. Here we report far-ultraviolet observations of the nearby low-mass star-forming galaxy J0925+1403. The galaxy is leaking ionizing radiation with an escape fraction of about 8 per cent. The total number of photons emitted during the starburst phase is sufficient to ionize intergalactic medium material that is about 40 times as massive as the stellar mass of the galaxy.},

Recently discovered Lyman continuum (LyC) emitters have extremely high oxygen line ratios: O32$\gt$4. Here we aim to understand the properties and the occurrences of galaxies with such high line ratios. Combining data from several MUSE GTO programmes, we select a population of star-forming galaxies with bright emission lines, from which we draw 406 galaxies for our analysis based on their position in the z-dependent star formation rate (SFR) - stellar mass (M*) plane. Out of this sample 15 are identified as extreme oxygen emitters based on their O32 ratios (3.7\%) and 104 galaxies have O32$\gt$1 (26\%). Our analysis shows no significant correlation between M*, SFR, and the distance from the SFR-M* relation with O32. We find a decrease in the fraction of galaxies with O32$\gt$1 with increasing M*, however, this is most likely a result of the relationship between O32 and metallicity, rather than between O32 and M*. We draw a comparison sample of local analogues with $\lt$z$\gt$\~{}0.03 from SDSS, and find similar incidence rates for this sample. In order to investigate the evolution in the fraction of high O32 emitters with redshift, we bin the sample into three redshift subsamples of equal number, but find no evidence for a dependence on redshift. Furthermore, we compare the observed line ratios with those predicted by nebular models with no LyC escape and find that most of the extreme oxygen emitters can be reproduced by low metallicity models. The remaining galaxies are likely LyC emitter candidates. Finally, based on a comparison between electron temperature estimates from the [OIII4363]/[OIII]5007 ratio of the extreme oxygen emitters and nebular models, we argue that the galaxies with the most extreme O32 ratios have young light-weighted ages.},

The IMF is densely sampled up to 200 M{\#9737} and contains 32 {\plusmn} 12\% more stars above 30 M{\#9737} than predicted by a standard Salpeter IMF. In the mass range of 15 to 200 M{\#9737}, the IMF power-law exponent is 1.90{\minus}0.26+0.37, shallower than the Salpeter value of 2.35.},

  abstract = {A cosmologically significant population of very luminous high-redshift galaxies has recently been discovered at submillimeter (submm) wavelengths. Advances in submm detector technologies have opened this new window on the distant Universe. Here we discuss the properties of the high-redshift submm galaxies, their significance for our understanding of the process of galaxy formation, and the selection effects that apply to deep submm surveys. The submm galaxies generate a significant fraction of the energy output of all the galaxies in the early Universe. We emphasize the importance of studying a complete sample of submm galaxies, and stress that because they are typically very faint in other wavebands, these follow-up observations are very challenging. Finally, we discuss the surveys that will be made using the next generation of submm-wave instruments under development.},

  abstract      = {Using high-quality optical images from the Carnegie-Irvine Galaxy Survey, we perform multicomponent decompositions of S0 galaxies (S0s) to derive accurate structural parameters to constrain their physical origin. Many S0s do not host prominent bulges. S0s have a broad distribution of bulge-to-total ratios (B/T) and S{\'e}rsic indices (n), with average values of B/T = 0.34 {\plusmn} 0.15 and n = 2.62 {\plusmn} 1.02, qualitatively consistent with the notion that S0s define a parallel sequence with and may have evolved from spiral galaxies. This is further reinforced by the incidence of bars and lenses in S0s, which, when compared with the statistics in spirals, supports the idea that lenses are demised bars. However, despite their wide range of prominence, the bulges of S0s form a surprisingly uniform sequence on both the Kormendy and fundamental plane relations. There is no evidence for population dichotomy or other indications of differentiation into classical and pseudobulges. Most of the S0s reside in the field and in groups; cluster environment is not a necessary condition for S0 production. The properties of S0 bulges show little correlation with environmental indicators, after the dependence of galaxy stellar mass on environment is taken into account. As the bulges of late-type spirals and S0s are intrinsically different, and environmental effects that may account for such evolution appear to be minimal, we conclude that late-type spirals are not plausible progenitors of S0s. The bulges of S0s likely formed at an early epoch, after which secular processes contributed little to their subsequent evolution.},

Here, we report the results of the analysis of XMM-Newton data for the massive, lenticular galaxy NGC 7049. The galaxy harbours a dusty disk of cool gas and is surrounded by an extended hot X-ray emitting gaseous atmosphere. The central entropy of the hot gas permeating this fast-rotating galaxy is unusually high and it remains systemically higher than that in most non-rotating massive galaxies at all investigated radii. The hot gas in the plane of rotation of the cool dusty disc has a multi-temperature structure, consistent with ongoing cooling. We conclude that the rotational support of the hot gas is likely capable of altering the multiphase condensation regardless of the $t\_{\rm cool}/t\_{\rm ff}$ ratio, which is here relatively high, $\sim 50$. However, the measured ratio of cooling time and eddy turnover time around unity ($C$-ratio $\approx 1$) implies significant condensation, and at the same time, the constrained ratio of rotational velocity and the velocity dispersion (turbulent Taylor number) ${\rm Ta\_t} \gt 1$ indicates that the condensing gas should follow non-radial orbits forming a disc instead of filaments. This is in agreement with hydrodynamical simulations of massive rotating galaxies predicting a similarly extended multiphase disc.},

  abstract      = {Previous findings show that the existence of dense cores or bulges is the prerequisite for quenching a galaxy, leading to a proposed two-step quenching scenario: compaction and quenching. In this scenario, galaxies first grow their cores to a stellar mass surface density threshold and subsequently quenching occurs, suggesting that galaxies evolve from extended star-forming galaxies (eSFGs), through compact star-forming galaxies (cSFGs), to quenched population. In this work, we aim at examining the possible evolutionary link between eSFGs and cSFGs by identifying the trends in star formation rate (SFR), gas-phase metallicity and HI content, since one would naturally expect that galaxies evolve along the track of cold gas consumption and metal enhancement. We select a volume-limited sample of 15,933 galaxies with stellar mass above $10^{9.5}M\_{\odot}$ and redshift of 0.02 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 0.05 from the NASA-Sloan-Atlas catalog within the ALFALFA footprint. The cSFGs on average exhibit similar or slightly higher SFRs of $\sim$0.06 dex and significantly higher gas-phase metallicity (up to 0.2 dex at low mass) with respect to the eSFGs, while the cSFGs dominate the galaxy population of the most intense star formation activities. More importantly, overall the median HI content and gas depletion time of cSFGs are about half of eSFGs. Our result supports the compaction and quenching scenario that galaxies evolve and grow their cores along the track of cold gas consumption and metal enhancement. The environments of eSFGs and cSFGs are indistinguishable, suggesting that the compaction process is independent of any environmental effects at least for low-redshift universe.},

Once star formation has been shut down, perhaps during the quasar phase of rapid accretion onto a supermassive black hole, an unknown mechanism must remove or heat the gas that is subsequently accreted from either stellar mass loss or mergers and that would otherwise cool to form stars. Energy output from a black hole accreting at a low rate has been proposed, but observational evidence for this in the form of expanding hot gas shells is indirect and limited to radio galaxies at the centres of clusters, which are too rare to explain the vast majority of the quiescent population. Here we report bisymmetric emission features co-aligned with strong ionized-gas velocity gradients from which we infer the presence of centrally driven winds in typical quiescent galaxies that host low-luminosity active nuclei. These galaxies are surprisingly common, accounting for as much as ten per cent of the quiescent population with masses around 2{\thinsp}{\times}{\thinsp}10$^{10}$ times that of the Sun. In a prototypical example, we calculate that the energy input from the galaxy{\rsquo}s low-level active supermassive black hole is capable of driving the observed wind, which contains sufficient mechanical energy to heat ambient, cooler gas (also detected) and thereby suppress star formation.},

We perform two sets of cosmological zoom-in simulations of 30 halos to z=0: (1) without black holes and Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) feedback and (2) with AGN feedback arising from winds and X-ray radiation.

We also find that galaxies simulated with AGN feedback evolve along similar tracks to those characterized by observations in specific star formation versus compactness. We confirm that AGN feedback plays an important role in transforming galaxies from blue compact galaxies into red extended galaxies in two ways: (1) it effectively quenches the star formation, transforming blue compact galaxies into compact quiescent galaxies and (2) it also removes and prevents new accretion of cold gas, shutting down in-situ star formation and causing subsequent mergers to be gas-poor or mixed. Gas poor minor mergers then build up an extended stellar envelope. AGN feedback also puffs up the central region through the fast AGN driven winds as well as the slow expulsion of gas while the black hole is quiescent.

  abstract    = {Gas stripping of spiral galaxies or mergers are thought to be the formation mechanisms of lenticular galaxies. In order to determine the conditions in which each scenario dominates, we derive stellar populations of both the bulge and disk regions of 279 lenticular galaxies in the MaNGA survey. We find a clear bimodality in stellar age and metallicity within the population of S0s and this is strongly correlated with stellar mass. Old and metal-rich bulges and disks belong to massive galaxies, and young and metal-poor bulges and disks are hosted by low-mass galaxies. From this we conclude that the bulges and disks are co-evolving. When the bulge and disk stellar ages are compared, we find that the bulge is almost always older than the disk for massive galaxies ($\textrm{M}_{\star} > 10^{10}~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$). The opposite is true for lower mass galaxies. We conclude that we see two separate populations of lenticular galaxies. The old, massive, and metal-rich population possess bulges that are predominantly older than their disks, which we speculate may have been caused by morphological or inside-out quenching. In contrast, the less massive and more metal-poor population have bulges with more recent star formation than their disks. We postulate they may be undergoing bulge rejuvenation (or disk fading), or compaction. Environment doesn't play a distinct role in the properties of either population. Our findings give weight to the notion that while the faded spiral scenario likely formed low-mass S0s, other processes, such as mergers, may be responsible for high-mass S0s.},

Here we present a detailed observational study of the gLSB UGC 1922 performed using deep optical imaging and spectroscopic observations combined with archival ultraviolet data. We derived spatially resolved properties of stellar and ionized gas kinematics and characteristics of stellar populations and interstellar medium. We reveal the presence of a kinematically decoupled central component, which counter rotates with respect to the main disc of UGC 1922. The radial metallicity gradient of the ionised gas is in agreement with that found for moderate-size LSB galaxies. At the same time, a slowly rotating and dynamically hot central region of the galaxy hosts a large number of old metal-rich stars, which creates an appearance of a giant elliptical galaxy, that grew an enormous star forming disc. We reproduce most of the observed features of UGC 1922 in N-body/hydrodynamical simulations of an in-plane merger of giant Sa and Sd galaxies.

  abstract      = {There are many candidate sites of the r-process: core-collapse supernovae (including rare magnetorotational core-collapse supernovae), neutron star mergers, and neutron star/black hole mergers. The chemical enrichment of galaxies---specifically dwarf galaxies---helps distinguish between these sources based on the continual build-up of r-process elements. This technique can distinguish between the r-process candidate sites by the clearest observational difference---how quickly these events occur after the stars are created. The existence of several nearby dwarf galaxies allows us to measure robust chemical abundances for galaxies with different star formation histories. Dwarf galaxies are especially useful because simple chemical evolution models can be used to determine the sources of r-process material. We have measured the r-process element barium with Keck/DEIMOS medium-resolution spectroscopy. We present the largest sample of barium abundances (almost 250 stars) in dwarf galaxies ever assembled. We measure [Ba/Fe] as a function of [Fe/H] in this sample and compare with existing [alpha/Fe] measurements. We have found that a large contribution of barium needs to occur at more delayed timescales than core-collapse supernovae in order to explain our observed abundances, namely the significantly more positive trend of the r-process component of [Ba/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] seen for [Fe/H] $\lt$\~{} -1.6 when compared to the [Mg/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] trend. We conclude that neutron star mergers are the most likely source of r-process enrichment in dwarf galaxies at early times.},

Major mergers are selected from the CANDELS/3D-HST catalog using a peak-finding algorithm. Mergers have projected galaxy nuclei separation of their members between 3-15 kpc. We compare the star formation activity in merging and non-merging galaxies and find no significant differences. We find that only 12\% of the galaxies in major mergers (in which both galaxies have log(M/Msun)$\gt$10) are star-bursting (i.e., with SFR above the main sequence of star-forming galaxies by $\gt$0.5 dex). Merging galaxies which include galaxies with lower masses show a higher fraction of star-bursting galaxies (20\%). The low fraction of star-bursting merging galaxies in this sample suggests that at galaxy nuclei separations of 3-15 kpc merging galaxies are still in a early stage and are yet to reach the maximum level of star formation activity. Furthermore, the level of star formation enhancement and its duration could be arguably reduced compared to local mergers, as shown by simulations of high-z mergers, and might also depend on the physical properties (such as stellar mass and gas fraction) of the merging galaxies. Finally, we compare the specific SFR between merging galaxies. Our results suggest that, as the mass of the merging galaxies increases, the star formation activity in the less massive member in the merger suffers a more dramatic impact than its companion galaxy.},

Little is known about the gas conditions and radiation field of this population, making it challenging to interpret the spectra emerging at $z\gtrsim6$. Motivated by this shortcoming, we have initiated a large MMT spectroscopic survey targeting rest-optical emission lines in 227 intense [OIII] emitting galaxies at $1.3\ltz\lt2.4$. This sample complements the MOSDEF and KBSS surveys, extending to lower stellar masses ($10^7-10^8 M\_\odot$) and larger specific star formation rates ($5-300$ Gyr$^{-1}$), providing a window on galaxies directly following a burst or recent upturn in star formation. The hydrogen ionizing production efficiency is found to increase with the [OIII] EW, in a manner similar to that found in local galaxies by Chevallard et al. (2018). We describe how this relationship helps explain the anomalous success rate in identifying Ly$\alpha$ emission in $z\gtrsim7$ galaxies with strong [O III]+H$\beta$ emission. We probe the impact of the intense radiation field on the ISM using O32 and Ne3O2, two ionization-sensitive indices. Both are found to scale with the [OIII] EW, revealing extreme ionization conditions not commonly seen in older and more massive galaxies. In the most intense line emitters, the indices have very large average values (O32 $=9.1$, Ne3O2 $=0.5$) that have been shown to be linked to ionizing photon escape. We discuss implications for the nature of galaxies most likely to have O32 values associated with significant LyC escape. Finally we consider the optimal strategy for JWST spectroscopic investigations of galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$ where the strongest rest-optical lines are no longer visible with NIRSpec.},

The two main, competing scenarios are external accretion of lower mass, gas-rich dwarfs and internal production from stellar mass loss and/or cooling from the hot interstellar medium (ISM). We test these hypotheses with measurements of the stellar and nebular metallicities of three ETGs (NGC 2768, NGC 3245, and NGC 4694) from new long-slit, high signal-to-noise ratio spectroscopy from the Multi-Object Double Spectographs (MODs) on the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). These ETGs have modest star formation rates and minimal evidence of nuclear activity. We model the stellar continuum to derive chemical abundances and measure gas-phase abundances with standard nebular diagnostics. We find that the stellar and gas-phase abundances are very similar, which supports internal production and is very inconsistent with the accretion of smaller, lower metallicity dwarfs. All three of these galaxies are also consistent with an extrapolation of the mass-metallicity relation to higher mass galaxies with lower specific star formation rates. The emission line flux ratios along the long-slit, as well as global line ratios clearly indicate that photoionization dominates and ionization by alternate sources including AGN activity, shocks, cosmic rays, dissipative magnetohydrodynamic waves, and single degenerate Type Ia supernovae progenitors do not significantly affect the line ratios.},

  abstract      = {The number of Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs) in clusters is of significant importance to constrain models of their formation and evolution. Furthermore, their distribution inside clusters may tell us something about their interactions with their environments. In this work we revisit the abundance of UDGs in a more consistent way than in previous studies. We add new data of UDGs in eight clusters from the Kapteyn IAC WEAVE INT Clusters Survey (KIWICS), covering a mass range in which only a few clusters have been studied before, and complement these with a compilation of works in the literature to homogeneously study the relation between the number of UDGs and the mass of their host cluster. Overall, we find that the slope of the number of UDGs$-$cluster mass relation is consistent with being sublinear when considering galaxy groups or linear if they are excluded, but we argue that most likely the behavior is sublinear. When systematically studying the relation between the projected distance to the innermost UDG and M$\_{200}$ for each cluster, we find hints that favor a picture in which massive clusters destroy UDGs in their centres.},

  abstract      = {We study the shape and evolution of the star formation main sequence in three independently developed semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. We focus, in particular, on the characterization of the model galaxies that are significantly above the main sequence, and that can be identified with galaxies classified as `starburst' in recent observational work. We find that, in all three models considered, star formation triggered by merger events (both minor and major) contribute to only a very small fraction of the cosmic density of star formation. While mergers are associated to bursts of star formation in all models, galaxies that experienced recent merger events are not necessarily significantly above the main sequence. On the other hand, `starburst galaxies' are not necessarily associated with merger episodes, especially at the low-mass end. Galaxies that experienced recent mergers can have relatively low levels of star formation when/if the merger is gas-poor, and galaxies with no recent merger can experience episodes of starbursts due to a combination of large amount of cold gas available from cooling/accretion events and/or small disk radii which increases the cold gas surface density.},

  abstract      = {We present a sample of 66 galaxies belonging to the equatorial part (Dec.= -7$^o$, +7$^o$) of the large so called Eridanus void (after Fairall 1998). The void galaxies are selected as to be separated from the luminous galaxies ($M\_{\rm B} \lt M\_{\rm B}^{*} +1$), delineating the void, by more than 2 Mpc. Our main goal is to study systematically the evolutionary parameters of the void sample (metallicity and gas content) and to compare the void galaxy properties with their counterparts residing in denser environments. Besides the general galaxy parameters, compiled mainly from the literature, we present the results of dedicated observations to measure the oxygen abundance O/H in HII-regions of 23 void galaxies obtained with the 11-m SALT telescope (SAAO) and the 6-m BTA telescope (SAO), as well as the O/H estimates derived from the analysis of the SDSS DR12 spectra for 3 objects. We compiled all available data on O/H in 36 these void galaxies, including those for 11 galaxies available in the literature (for one object both SDSS and SALT spectra were used), and analyze this data in relation to galaxy luminosity ($\log$(O/H) versus $M\_{\rm B}$). Comparing them with the control sample of similar type galaxies from the Local Volume, we find clear evidence for a substantially lower average metallicity of the Eridanus void galaxies. This result matches well the conclusions of our recent similar study for galaxies in the Lynx-Cancer void.},

If there is such a connection, the r-II stars we observe today could play a key role in understanding the smallest building blocks of the Milky Way. To conduct this initial investigation, we use high-resolution cosmological simulations of Milky-Way-mass galaxies (the Caterpillar suite) in combination with a simple, empirically motivated treatment of r-process enrichment. We determine the fraction of metal-poor halo stars that could have formed from highly r-process enhanced gas in now-destroyed ultra-faint dwarfs, the simulated r-II fraction, and compare this to the observed r-II fraction. We find that the simulated fraction (f\_$\{$r-II,sim$\}$ \~{} 1-2\%) can account for around half of the observed fraction (f\_$\{$r-II,obs$\}$ \~{} 2-4\%) when taken at face value. Due to publishing bias, though, the observed fraction probably overrepresents the number of r-II stars, meaning f\_$\{$r-II,sim$\}$ likely accounts for more than half of the true f\_$\{$r-II,obs$\}$. Further considering some parameter variation and scatter between simulations, the simulated fraction can account for around \~{}20-80\% of the observed fraction.},

This paper identifies common features between these seemingly disparate phenomena described above for the population of radio galaxies, and strings them together by way of a simple phenomenological framework that has shed light on the radio loud/radio quiet dichotomy, the jet-disk connection, and the distribution of all active galaxies as a function of redshift.},

  abstract      = {The apparent lack of cold molecular gas in blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies is at variance with their intense star-formation episode. The CO molecule, often used a tracer of H2 through a conversion function, is selectively photodissociated in dust-poor environments and, as a result, a potentially large fraction of H2 is expected to reside in the so-called CO-dark gas, where it could be traced instead by infrared cooling lines [CI], [CII], and [OI]. Although the fraction of CO-dark gas to total molecular gas is expected to be relatively large in metal-poor galaxies, many uncertainties remain due to the difficulty in identifying the main heating mechanism associated to the cooling lines observed in such galaxies. Investigations of the Herschel Dwarf Galaxy Survey show that the heating mechanism in the neutral gas of BCDs cannot be dominated by the photoelectric effect on dust grains below some threshold metallicity, implying that other heating mechanisms need to be invoked, along with a new interpretation of the corresponding infrared line diagnostics. In the study presented here and in Lebouteiller et al. 2017, we use optical and infrared lines to constrain the physical conditions in the HII region + HI region of the BCD IZw18 (18Mpc; 2\% solar metallicity) within a consistent photoionization and photodissociation model. We show that the HI region is entirely heated by a single ultraluminous X-ray source with important consequences on the applicability of [CII] to trace the star-formation rate and to trace the CO-dark gas. We derive stringent upper limits on the size of H2 clumps that may be detected in the future with JWST and IRAM/NOEMA. We also show that the nature of the X-ray source can be inferred from the corresponding signatures in the ISM. Finally we speculate that star formation may be quenched in extremely metal-poor dwarf galaxies due to X-ray photoionization.},

However, current stellar population/photo-ionization models lack sufficient He$^+$ ionising photons to reproduce observed HeII fluxes while being consistent with other emission lines. Using $\sim10-30$ hour deep pointings from MUSE, we obtain $\sim10$ $z\sim2-4$ HeII$\lambda1640$ emitters to study their inter-stellar medium (ISM) and stellar population properties. Emission line ratio diagnostics of our sample suggest that emission lines are driven by star-formation in solar to moderately sub-solar ($\sim 1/20$th) metallicity conditions. However, we find that even after considering effects from binary stars, we are unable to reproduce the HeII$\lambda1640$ equivalent widths (EWs). Our analysis suggest that extremely sub-solar metallicities ($\sim1/200$th) are required to reproduce observed HeII$\lambda1640$ luminosities. Thus, current stellar populations may require alternative mechanisms such as sub-dominant active galactic nuclei (AGN) or top heavy initial-mass-functions (IMFs) to compensate the missing He$^+$ ionising photons.},
