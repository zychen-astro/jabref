  abstract = {The dust attenuation for a sample of ∼10,000 local ( z ≲ 0.1) star-forming galaxies is constrained as a function of their physical properties. We utilize aperture-matched multiwavelength data available from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to ensure that regions of comparable size in each galaxy are being analyzed. We follow the method of Calzetti et al. and characterize the dust attenuation through the UV power-law index, β , and the dust optical depth, which is quantified using the difference in Balmer emission line optical depth, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/818/1/13/apj522358ieqn1.gif] {${\tau }_{B}^{l}={\tau }_{{\rm{H}}\beta }-{\tau }_{{\rm{H}}\alpha }$} . The observed linear relationship between β and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/818/1/13/apj522358ieqn2.gif] {${\tau }_{B}^{l}$} is similar to the local starburst relation, but the large scatter ( σ int = 0.44) suggests that there is significant variation in the local universe. We derive a selective attenuation curve over the range 1250Å < λ < 8320 Å and find that a single attenuation curve is effective for characterizing the majority of galaxies in our sample. This curve has a slightly lower selective attenuation in the UV compared to previously determined curves. We do not see evidence to suggest that a 2175 Å feature is significant in the average attenuation curve. Significant positive correlations are seen between the amount of UV and optical reddening and galaxy metallicity, mass, star formation rate (SFR), and SFR surface density. This provides a potential tool for gauging attenuation where the stellar population is unresolved, such as athigh z .},

  abstract = {We present far-infrared (FIR) photometry at 150 and 205 {$\mu$}m of eight low-redshift starburst galaxies obtained with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) ISOPHOT. Five of the eight galaxies are detected in both wave bands, and these data are used, in conjunction with IRAS archival photometry, to model the dust emission at {$\lambda$}$\gt$\~{}40 {$\mu$}m. The FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are best fitted by a combination of two modified Planck functions, with T\~{}40-55 K (warm dust) and T\~{}20-23 K (cool dust) and with a dust emissivity index {$\epsilon$}=2. The cool dust can be a major contributor to the FIR emission of starburst galaxies, representing up to 60\% of the total flux. This component is heated not only by the general interstellar radiation field, but also by the starburst itself. The cool dust mass is up to \~{}150 times larger than the warm dust mass, bringing the gas-to-dust ratios of the starbursts in our sample close to Milky Way values, once rescaled for the appropriate metallicity. The ratio between the total dust FIR emission in the range 1-1000 {$\mu$}m and the IRAS FIR emission in the range 40-120 {$\mu$}m is \~{}1.75, with small variations from galaxy to galaxy. This ratio is about 40\% larger than previously inferred from data at millimeter wavelengths. Although the galaxies in our sample are generally classified as ``UV bright,'' for four of them the UV energy emerging shortward of 0.2 {$\mu$}m is less than 15\% of the FIR energy. On average, about 30\% of the bolometric flux is coming out in the UV-to-near-IR wavelength range; the rest is emitted in the FIR. Energy balance calculations show that the FIR emission predicted by the dust reddening of the UV-to-near-IR stellar emission is within a factor of \~{}2 of the observed value in individual galaxies and within 20\% when averaged over a large sample. If our sample of local starbursts is representative of high-redshift (z$\gt$\~{}1), UV-bright, star-forming galaxies, these galaxies' FIR emission will be generally undetected in submillimeter surveys, unless (1) their bolometric luminosity is comparable to or larger than that of ultraluminous FIR galaxies and (2) their FIR SED contains a cool dust component.

  abstract = {The IUE UV and optical spectra and the far-infrared (FIR) IRAS flux densities of a sample of starburst and blue compact galaxies are used to investigate the relationship between dust obscuration and dust emission. The amount of dust obscuration at UV wavelengths correlates with the FIR-to-blue ratio; and an analysis of the correlation indicates that not only the ionizing but also the nonionizing radiation contribute to the FIR emission. The amount of UV and optical energy lost to dust obscuration accounts for most of the cool dust FIUR emission and for about 70\% of the warm dust FIR emission. The remaining 30\% of the warm dust FIR flux is probably due to dust emission from regions of star formation which are embedded in opaque giant molecular clouds and do not contribute to the integrated UV and optical spectrum. The use of the FIR emission as an indicator of high-mass star formation rate in star-forming galaxies can be problematic, since the contribution to the FIR flux from cool dust emission heated by relatively old stars is nonnegligible.},

  abstract = {We analyze the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) UV and the optical spectra of 39 starburst and blue compact galaxies in order to study the average properties of dust extinction in extended regions of galaxies. The optical spectra have been obtained using an aperture which matches that of IUE, so comparable regions within each galaxy are sampled. The data from the 39 galaxies are compared with five models for the geometrical distribution of dust, adopting as extinction laws both the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud laws. The commonly used uniform dust screen is included among the models. We find that none of the five models is in satisfactory agreement with the data. In order to understand the discrepancy between the data and the models, we have derived an extinction law directly from the data in the UV and optical wavelength range. The resulting curve is characterized by an overall slope which is more gray than the Milky Way extinction law's slope, and by the absence of the 2175 A dust feature. Remarkably, the difference in optical depth between the Balmer emission lines H$_{alpha}$ and H$_{beta}$ is about a factor of 2 larger than the difference in the optical depth between the continuum underlying the two Balmer lines. We interpret this discrepancy as a consequence of the fact that the hot ionizing stars are associated with dustier regions than the cold stellar population is. The absence of the 2175 A dust feature can be due either to the effects of the scattering and clumpiness of the dust or to a chemical composition different from that of the Milky Way dust grains. Disentangling the two interpretations is not easy because of the complexity of the spatial distribution of the emitting regions. The extinction law of the UV and optical spectral continua of extended regions can be applied to the spectra of medium- and high-redshift galaxies, where extended regions of a galaxy are, by necessity, sampled.},

  title       = {An extremely low mid-infrared extinction law toward the Galactic Center and 4% distance precision to 55 classical Cepheids},
  abstract    = {Distances and extinction values are usually degenerate. To refine the distance to the general Galactic Center region, a carefully determined extinction law (taking into account the prevailing systematic errors) is urgently needed. We collected data for 55 classical Cepheids projected toward the Galactic Center region to derive the near- to mid-infrared extinction law using three different approaches. The relative extinction values obtained are AJ/AKs = 3.005, AH/AKs = 1.717, A[3.6]/AKs = 0.478, A[4.5]/AKs = 0.341, A[5.8]/AKs = 0.234, A[8.0]/AKs = 0.321, AW1/AKs = 0.506, and AW2/AKs = 0.340. We also calculated the corresponding systematic errors. Compared with previous work, we report an extremely low and steep mid-infrared extinction law. Using a seven-passband 'optimal distance' method, we improve the mean distance precision to our sample of 55 Cepheids to 4%. Based on four confirmed Galactic Center Cepheids, a solar Galactocentric distance of R_0 = 8.10\pm0.19\pm0.22 kpc is determined, featuring an uncertainty that is close to the limiting distance accuracy (2.8%) for Galactic Center Cepheids.},

  abstract = {Large amounts of dust ($\gt$10$^{8}$M$_{⊙}$) have recently been discovered in high-redshift quasars and galaxies corresponding to a time when the Universe was less than one-tenth of its present age. The stellar winds produced by stars in the late stages of their evolution (on the asymptotic giant branch of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram) are thought to be the main source of dust in galaxies, but they cannot produce that dust on a short enough timescale ($\lt$1Gyr) to explain the results in the high-redshift galaxies. Supernova explosions of massive stars (type II) are also a potential source, with models predicting 0.2-4M$_{⊙}$ of dust. As massive stars evolve rapidly, on timescales of a few Myr, these supernovae could be responsible for the high-redshift dust. Observations of supernova remnants in the Milky Way, however, have hitherto revealed only 10$^{-7}$-10$^{-3}$M$_{⊙}$ each, which is insufficient to explain the high-redshift data. Here we report the detection of \~{}2-4M$_{⊙}$ of cold dust in the youngest known Galactic supernova remnant, Cassiopeia A. This observation implies that supernovae are at least as important as stellar winds in producing dust in our Galaxy and would have been the dominant source of dust at high redshifts.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the issue of how best to correct astronomical data for the wavelength‐dependent effects of Galactic interstellar extinction. The main general features of extinction from the IR through the UV are reviewed, along with the nature of observed spatial variations. The enormous range of extinction properties found in the Galaxy, particularly in the UV spectral region, is illustrated. Fortunately, there are some tight constraints on the wavelength dependence of extinction and some general correlations between extinction curve shape and interstellar environment. These relationships provide some guidance for correcting data for the effects of extinction. Several strategies for dereddening are discussed along with estimates of the uncertainties inherent in each method. In the Appendix, a new derivation of the wavelength dependence of an average Galactic extinction curve from the IR through the UV is presented, along with a new estimate of how this extinction law varies with the parameter R≡A(V)/ E ( B − V ). These curves represent the true monochromatic wavelength dependence of extinction and, as such, are suitable for dereddening IR–UV spectrophotometric data of any resolution and can be used to derive extinction relations for any photometry system.},

We constrain the scaling relations of molecular gas depletion timescale ( t depl ) and gas to stellar mass ratio ( M mol gas / M * ) of SFGs near the star formation "main-sequence" with redshift, specific star-formation rate (sSFR), and stellar mass ( M * ). The CO- and dust-based scaling relations agree remarkably well. This suggests that the CO → H 2 mass conversion factor varies little within ±0.6 dex of the main sequence (sSFR(ms, z , M * )), and less than 0.3 dex throughout this redshift range. This study builds on and strengthens the results of earlier work. We find that t depl scales as (1 + z ) –0.3 × (sSFR/sSFR(ms, z , M * )) –0.5 , with little dependence on M * . The resulting steep redshift dependence of M mol gas / M * ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} (1 + z ) 3 mirrors that of the sSFR and probably reflects the gas supply rate. The decreasing gas fractions at high M * are driven by the flattening of the SFR- M * relation. Throughout the probed redshift range a combination of an increasing gas fraction and a decreasing depletion timescale causes a larger sSFR at constant M * . As a result, galaxy integrated samples of the M mol gas -SFR rate relation exhibit a super-linear slope, which increases with the range of sSFR. With these new relations it is now possible to determine M mol gas with an accuracy of ±0.1 dex in relative terms, and ±0.2 dex including systematic uncertainties.},

  abstract = {This Letter utilizes composite spectral energy distributions (SEDs) constructed from NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey photometry to constrain the dust attenuation curve in 0.5 < z < 2.0 galaxies. Based on similarities between the full SED shapes (0.3-8 μm), we have divided galaxies in 32 different spectral classes and stacked their photometry. As each class contains galaxies over a range in redshift, the resulting rest-frame SEDs are well sampled in wavelength and show various spectral features including Hα and the UV dust bump at 2175 Å. We fit all composite SEDs with flexible stellar population synthesis models, while exploring attenuation curves with varying slopes and UV bump strengths. The Milky Way and Calzetti law provide poor fits at UV wavelengths for nearly all SEDs. Consistent with previous studies, we find that the best-fit attenuation law varies with spectral type. There is a strong correlation between the best-fit dust slope and UV bump strength, with steeper laws having stronger bumps. Moreover, the attenuation curve correlates with specific star formation rate (SFR), with more active galaxies having shallower dust curves and weaker bumps. There is also a weak correlation with inclination. The observed trends can be explained by differences in the dust-to-star geometry, a varying grain size distribution, or a combination of both. Our results have several implications for galaxy evolution studies. First, the assumption of a universal dust model leads to biases in derived galaxy properties. Second, the presence of a dust bump may result in underestimated values for the UV slope, used to correct SFRs of distant galaxies.},

  abstract    = {Gaia data and stellar surveys open the way to the construction of detailed 3D maps of the Galactic interstellar (IS) dust based on the synthesis of star distances and extinctions. Reliable extinction measurements require very accurate photometric calibrations. We show the first step of an iterative process linking 3D dust maps and photometric calibrations and improving them simultaneously. Our previous 3D map of nearby IS dust was used to select low reddening SDSS/APOGEE-DR14 red giants, and this database served for an empirical effective temperature- and metallicity-dependent photometric calibration in the Gaia G and 2MASS Ks bands. This calibration has been combined with Gaia G-band empirical extinction coefficients recently published, G, J and Ks photometry and APOGEE atmospheric parameters to derive the extinction of a large fraction of the survey targets. Distances were estimated independently using isochrones and the magnitude-independent extinction K(J-Ks). This new dataset has been merged with the one used for the earlier version of dust map. A new Bayesian inversion of distance-extinction pairs has been performed to produce an updated 3D map. We present several properties of the new map. Its comparison with 2D dust emission reveals that all large dust shells seen in emission at mid- and high-latitude are closer than 300pc. The updated distribution constrains the well debated, X-ray bright North Polar Spur to originate beyond 800 pc. We use the Orion region to illustrate additional details and distant clouds. On the large scale the map reveals a complex structure of the Local Arm. 2 to 3 kpc-long chains of clouds appear in planes tilted by 15 deg with respect to the Galactic plane. A series of cavities oriented along a l=60-240deg axis crosses the Arm. (http://stilism.obspm.fr)},

Using these observations, high-angular resolution infrared (IR) and sub-mm observations, we find an observational turn-over of the torus emission in the $30-40$ $\mu$m wavelength range with a characteristic temperature of $70-100$ K. This component is clearly different from the diffuse extended emission in the narrow line and star formation regions at 10-100 $\mu$m within the central 700 pc. We compute $2.2-432$ $\mu$m 2D images using the best inferred $\backslash$textsc$\{$clumpy$\}$ torus model based on several nuclear spectral energy distribution (SED) coverages. We find that when $1-20$ $\mu$m SED is used, the inferred result gives a small torus size ($\lt4$ pc radius) and a steep radial dust distribution. The computed torus using the $1-432$ $\mu$m SED provides comparable torus sizes, $5.1^{+0.4}\_{-0.4}$ pc radius, and morphology to the recently resolved 432 $\mu$m ALMA observations. This result indicates that the $1-20$ $\mu$m wavelength range is not able to probe the full extent of the torus. The characterization of the turn-over emission of the torus using the $30-60$ $\mu$m wavelength range is sensitive to the detection of cold dust in the torus. The morphology of the dust emission in our 2D image at 432 $\mu$m is spatially coincident with the cloud distribution, while the morphology of the emission in the $1-20$ $\mu$m wavelength range shows an elongated morphology perpendicular to the cloud distribution. We find that our 2D $\backslash$textsc$\{$clumpy$\}$ torus image at 12 $\mu$m can produce comparable results to those observed using IR interferometry.},

  abstract    = {We study dust attenuation curves of 230,000 individual galaxies in the local universe, ranging from quiescent to intensely star-forming systems, using GALEX, SDSS, and WISE photometry calibrated on Herschel-ATLAS. We use a new method of constraining SED fits with infrared luminosity (SED+LIR fitting), and parameterized attenuation curves determined with the CIGALE SED fitting code. Attenuation curve slopes and UV bump strengths are reasonably well constrained independently from one another. We find that $A_{\lambda}/A_V$ attenuation curves exhibit a very wide range of slopes that are on average as steep as the SMC curve slope. The slope is a strong function of optical opacity. Opaque galaxies have shallower curves - in agreement with recent radiate transfer models. The dependence of slopes on the opacity produces an apparent dependence on stellar mass: more massive galaxies having shallower slopes. Attenuation curves exhibit a wide range of UV bump amplitudes, from none to MW-like; with an average strength 1/3 of the MW bump. Notably, local analogs of high-redshift galaxies have an average curve that is somewhat steeper than the SMC curve, with a modest UV bump that can be to first order ignored, as its effect on the near-UV magnitude is 0.1 mag.

  abstract = {Dust attenuation affects nearly all observational aspects of galaxy evolution, yet very little is known about the form of the dust-attenuation law in the distant universe. Here, we model the spectral energy distributions of galaxies at z ∼ 1.5–3 from CANDELS with rest-frame UV to near-IR imaging under different assumptions about the dust law, and compare the amount of inferred attenuated light with the observed infrared (IR) luminosities. Some individual galaxies show strong Bayesian evidence in preference of one dust law over another, and this preference agrees with their observed location on the plane of infrared excess (IRX, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/827/1/20/apjaa2a65ieqn1.gif] {${L}_{\mathrm{TIR}}$} / ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/827/1/20/apjaa2a65ieqn2.gif] {${L}_{\mathrm{UV}}$} ) and UV slope ( β ). We generalize the shape of the dust law with an empirical model, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/827/1/20/apjaa2a65ieqn3.gif] {${A}_{\lambda ,\delta }=E{(B-V){k}_{\lambda }(\lambda /{\lambda }_{V})}^{\delta }$} where k λ is the dust law of Calzetti et al., and show that there exists a correlation between the color excess ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/827/1/20/apjaa2a65ieqn4.gif] {$E(B-V)$} and tilt δ with ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/827/1/20/apjaa2a65ieqn5.gif] {$\delta =(0.62\pm 0.05)\mathrm{log}(E(B-V))+(0.26\pm 0.02)$} . Galaxies with high color excess have a shallower, starburst-like law, and those with low color excess have a steeper, SMC-like law. Surprisingly, the galaxies in our sample show no correlation between the shape of the dust law and stellar mass, star formation rate, or β . The change in the dust law with color excess is consistent with a model where attenuation is caused by scattering, a mixed star–dust geometry, and/or trends with stellar population age, metallicity, and dust grain size. This rest-frame UV-to-near-IR method shows potential to constrain the dust law at even higher redshifts ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/827/1/20/apjaa2a65ieqn6.gif] {$z\gt 3$} ).},

  abstract = {We present a full-sky 100 {$\mu$}m map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 {$\mu$}m data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 {$\mu$}m map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of H$_{2}$ in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds are deficient in dust emission, as expected.  To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 {$\mu$}m DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 {$\mu$}m flux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 {$\mu$}m map no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 +/- 13 nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ at 140 {$\mu$}m and of 17 +/- 4 nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ at 240 {$\mu$}m (95\% confidence). This integrated flux \~{}2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field.  The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of 100 {$\mu$}m emission. We find consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B-V versus Mg$_{2}$ index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.},

This dataset is combined with ancillary optical and NIR fluxes to constrain the dust attenuation law in the rest-frame NUV region of star-forming galaxies within the redshift window 1.5$\lt$z$\lt$3. We focus on the NUV bump strength (B) and the total-to-selective extinction ratio (Rv), targeting a sample of 1,753 galaxies. By comparing the data with a set of population synthesis models coupled to a parametric dust attenuation law, we constrain Rv and B, as well as the colour excess, E(B-V). We find a correlation between Rv and B, that can be interpreted either as a result of the grain size distribution, or a variation of the dust geometry among galaxies. According to the former, small dust grains are associated with a stronger NUV bump. The latter would lead to a range of clumpiness in the distribution of dust within the interstellar medium of star-forming galaxies. The observed wide range of NUV bump strengths can lead to a systematic in the interpretation of the UV slope ($\beta$) typically used to characterize the dust content. In this study we quantify these variations, concluding that the effects are $\Delta\beta$\~{}0.4.},

The oldest components provide us with unique insight into how galaxies form and evolve over billions of years. The Galaxy is a luminous (L⋆) barred spiral with a central box/peanut bulge, a dominant disk, and a diffuse stellar halo. Based on global properties, it falls in the sparsely populated “green valley” region of the galaxy color-magnitude diagram. Here we review the key integrated, structural and kinematic parameters of the Galaxy, and point to uncertainties as well as directions for future progress. Galactic studies will continue to play a fundamental role far into the future because there are measurements that can only be made in the near field and much of contemporary astrophysics depends on such observations. },

  abstract      = {The shutdown of star formation in galaxies is generally termed ``quenching.'' Quenching may occur through a variety of processes, e.g., active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, stellar feedback, or the shock heating of gas in the dark matter halo. However, which mechanism(s) is, in fact, responsible for quenching is still in question. This paper addresses quenching by searching for traces of possible quenching processes through their effects on galaxy structural parameters such as stellar mass (M $_{*}$), M $_{*}$/r $_{e}$, surface stellar mass density (\~{}M $_{*}$/r $^{2}$ $_{e}$), and S{\'e}rsic index (n). We analyze the rest-frame U - B color correlations versus these structural parameters using a sample of galaxies in the redshift range 0.5 $\lt$= z $\lt$ 0.8 from the DEEP2/AEGIS survey. In addition to global radii, stellar masses, and S{\'e}rsic parameters, we also use ``bulge'' and ``disk'' photometric measurements from GIM2D fits to HST/ACS V and I images. We assess the tightness of the color relationships by measuring their ``overlap regions,'' defined as the area in color-parameter space in which red and blue galaxies overlap; the parameter that minimizes these overlap regions is considered to be the most effective color discriminator. We find that S{\'e}rsic index (n) has the smallest overlap region among all tested parameters and resembles a step function with a threshold value of n = 2.3. There exists, however, a significant population of outliers with blue colors yet high n values that seem to contradict this behavior; they make up {\ap}40\% of n $\gt$ 2.3 galaxies. We hypothesize that their S{\'e}rsic values may be distorted by bursts of star formation, AGNs, and/or poor fits, leading us to consider central surface stellar mass density, {$\Sigma$}*$_{1 kpc}$, as an alternative to S{\'e}rsic index. Not only does {$\Sigma$}*$_{1 kpc}$ correct the outliers, but it also forms a tight relationship with color, suggesting that the innermost structure of galaxies is most physically linked with quenching. Furthermore, at z \~{} 0.65, the majority of the blue cloud galaxies cannot simply fade onto the red sequence since their GIM2D bulge masses are only half as large on average as the bulge masses of similar red sequence galaxies, thus demonstrating that stellar mass must absolutely increase at the centers of galaxies as they quench. We discuss a two-stage model for quenching in which galaxy star formation rates are controlled by their dark halos while they are still in the blue cloud and a second quenching process sets in later, associated with the central stellar mass buildup. The mass buildup is naturally explained by any non-axisymmetric features in the potential, such as those induced by mergers and/or disk instabilities. However, the identity of the second quenching agent is still unknown. We have placed our data catalog online.},

  abstract      = {Understanding how bulges grow in galaxies is critical step towards unveiling the link between galaxy morphology and star-formation. To do so, it is necessary to decompose large sample of galaxies at different epochs into their main components (bulges and disks). This is particularly challenging, especially at high redshifts, where galaxies are poorly resolved. This work presents a catalog of bulge-disk decompositions of the surface brightness profiles of \~{}17.600 H-band selected galaxies in the CANDELS fields (F160W$\lt$23, 0$\lt$z$\lt$2) in 4 to 7 filters covering a spectral range of 430-1600nm. This is the largest available catalog of this kind up to z = 2. By using a novel approach based on deep-learning to select the best model to fit, we manage to control systematics arising from wrong model selection and obtain less contaminated samples than previous works. We show that the derived structural properties are within $\sim10-20\\%$ of random uncertainties. We then fit stellar population models to the decomposed SEDs (Spectral Energy Distribution) of bulges and disks and derive stellar masses (and stellar mass bulge-to-total ratios) as well as rest-frame colors (U,V,J) for bulges and disks separately. All data products are publicly released with this paper and through the web page https://lerma.obspm.fr/huertas/form\_CANDELS and will be used for scientific analysis in forthcoming works.},

The differential number counts of sBzKs and pBzKs are consistent with the results from the literature. Compared to the observed results, semi-analytic models of galaxy formation and evolution provide too few (many) galaxies at the high (low) mass end. Moreover, we find that the star formation rate and stellar mass of sBzKs follow the relation of the main sequence. Based on HST/Wide Field Camera 3 F160W imaging, we find a wide range of morphological diversities for sBzKs, from diffuse to early-type spiral structures, with relatively high M$_{20}$, large size and low G, while pBzKs have elliptical-like compact morphologies with lower M$_{20}$, smaller size and higher G, indicating a more concentrated and symmetric spatial extent of stellar population distribution in pBzKs than sBzKs. Furthermore, the sizes of pBzKs (sBzKs) at z {\sim} 2 are on average two to three (one to two) times smaller than those of local early-type (late-type) galaxies with similar stellar mass. Our findings imply that the two classes have different evolution models and mass assembly histories.  Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China.},

We derive the average effective radii of OGs and DGs, corresponding to 2.09 {\plusmn} 1.13 kpc and 3.27 {\plusmn} 1.14 kpc, respectively. Generally, the DGs are heterogeneous, with mixed features including bulges, disks and irregular structures, with relatively high M$_{20}$, large size and low G. By contrast, OGs have elliptical-like compact morphologies with lower M$_{20}$, smaller size and higher G, indicating a more concentrated and symmetric spatial extent of the stellar population distribution in OGs than DGs. These findings imply that OGs and DGs have different evolutionary processes, and that the minor merger scenario is the most likely mechanism for the structural properties of OGs. However, the size evolution of DGs is possibly due to the secular evolution of galaxies.  Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China.},

Dust and complex morphological structures are common. Dust is detected in 42% of galaxies brighter than B T = 12.15 mag, while kiloparsec-scale stellar disk, bars, and nuclear stellar disks are seen in 60% of galaxies with intermediate luminosity. Isophotal parameters are derived typically within 8 kpc from the center for the brightest galaxies, and 1.5 kpc for the faintest systems, with a resolution of 7 pc. For most galaxies, the surface brightness profiles are well described by a Sérsic model with index n that increases steadily with the galaxy luminosity; only for 8 of the 10 brightest galaxies are the inner profiles (typically within 100 pc of the center) lower than expected based on an extrapolation of the outer Sérsic model, and are better described by a single power-law function. Contrary to previous claims, we find no evidence in support of a strong bimodal behavior of the logarithmic slope of the inner surface brightness profile, γ; in particular the γ distribution for galaxies that do not show evidence of multiple morphological components is unimodal across the entire magnitude range spanned by the ACSVCS galaxies. Although the brightest galaxies have shallow inner profiles, the shallowest profiles are found in faint dwarf systems. The widely adopted separation of early-type galaxies between "core" and "power-law" types is questioned based on the present study.},

  abstract = {We present an analysis of galaxies in the CDF-South. We find a tight relation to z = 3 between color and size at a given mass, with red galaxies being small, and blue galaxies being large. We show that the relation is driven by stellar surface density or inferred velocity dispersion: galaxies with high surface density are red and have low specific star formation rates, and galaxies with low surface density are blue and have high specific star formation rates. Surface density and inferred velocity dispersion are better correlated with specific star formation rate and color than stellar mass. Hence stellar mass by itself is not a good predictor of the star formation history of galaxies. In general, galaxies at a given surface density have higher specific star formation rates at higher redshift. Specifically, galaxies with a surface density of (1–3) × 10 9 M ☉ kpc −2 are "red and dead" at low redshift, approximately 50% are forming stars at z = 1, and almost all are forming stars by z = 2. This provides direct additional evidence for the late evolution of galaxies onto the red sequence. The sizes of galaxies at a given mass evolve like 1/(1 + z ) 0.59 ± 0.10 . Hence galaxies undergo significant upsizing in their history. The size evolution is fastest for the highest mass galaxies and quiescent galaxies. The persistence of the structural relations from z = 0 to z = 2.5, and the upsizing of galaxies imply that a relation analogous to the Hubble sequence exists out to z = 2.5, and possibly beyond. The star-forming galaxies at z ≥ 1.5 are quite different from star-forming galaxies at z = 0, as they have likely very high gas fractions, and star formation timescales comparable to the orbital time.},

They can efficiently drive gas into the central kiloparsec of galaxies, thus feed circumnuclear starbursts, and possibly help to fuel AGN. The connection between bars and AGN activities has been actively debated in the past two decades. Previous work used fairly small samples and often lacked a proper control sample. They reported conflicting results on the correlation between bars and AGN activity. Here we revisit the bar-AGN and bar-starburst connections using the analysis of bars in a large sample of about 2000 SDSS disk galaxies (Barazza, Jogee, {\amp} Marinova 2008). We find that AGN and star-forming galaxies have similar optical bar fractions, 47\% and 50\%, respectively. Both bar fractions are higher than that in inactive galaxies (29\%). We discuss the implications of the study on the relationship between host galaxies and their central activities.},

Our sample of galaxies is sub-divided into red, green and blue colour groups and into elliptical and non-elliptical (disk-type) morphologies. Using KiDS and VIKING derived postage stamp images, a group of eight volunteers visually classified bars, rings, morphological lenses, tidal streams, shells and signs of merger activity for all systems. We find a significant surplus of rings ($2.3\sigma$) and lenses ($2.9\sigma$) in disk-type galaxies as they transition across the green valley. Combined, this implies a joint ring/lens green valley surplus significance of $3.3\sigma$ relative to equivalent disk-types within either the blue cloud or the red sequence. We recover a bar fraction of \~{}44\% which remains flat with colour, however, we find that the presence of a bar acts to modulate the incidence of rings and (to a lesser extent) lenses, with rings in barred disk-type galaxies more common by \~{}20-30 percentage points relative to their unbarred counterparts, regardless of colour. Additionally, green valley disk-type galaxies with a bar exhibit a significant $3.0\sigma$ surplus of lenses relative to their blue/red analogues. The existence of such structures rules out violent transformative events as the primary end-of-life evolutionary mechanism, with a more passive scenario the favoured candidate for the majority of galaxies rapidly transitioning across the green valley.},

  abstract    = {We present the first results of applying Gaussian Mixture Models in the stellar kinematic space of normalized angular momentum and binding energy on NIHAO high resolution galaxies to separate the stars into multiple components. We exemplify this method using a simulated Milky Way analogue, whose stellar component hosts: thin and thick discs, classical and pseudo bulges, and a stellar halo. The properties of these stellar structures are in good agreement with observational expectations in terms of sizes, shapes and rotational support. Interestingly, the two kinematic discs show surface mass density profiles more centrally concentrated than exponentials, while the bulges and the stellar halo are purely exponential. We trace back in time the Lagrangian mass of each component separately to study their formation history. Between z~3 and the end of halo virialization, z~1.3, all components lose a fraction of their angular momentum. The classical bulge loses the most (~95%) and the thin disc the least (~60%). Both bulges formed their stars in-situ at high redshift, while the thin disc formed ~98% in-situ, but with a constant SFR~1.5M$_{\rm\odot}$/yr$^{\rm-1}$ over the last ~11 Gyr. Accreted stars (6% of total stellar mass) are mainly incorporated to the thick disc or the stellar halo, which formed ex-situ 8% and 45% of their respective masses.

Our technique improves on previous 2D fitting algorithms by allowing for irregular, curved, logarithmic and power-law spirals, ring, and truncated shapes in otherwise traditional parametric functions like the Sérsic, Moffat, King, Ferrer, etc., profiles. One can mix and match these new shape features freely, with or without constraints, and apply them to an arbitrary number of model components of numerous profile types, so as to produce realistic-looking galaxy model images. Yet, despite the potential for extreme complexity, the meaning of the key parameters like the Sérsic index, effective radius, or luminosity remains intuitive and essentially unchanged. The new features have an interesting potential for use to quantify the degree of asymmetry of galaxies, to quantify low surface brightness tidal features beneath and beyond luminous galaxies, to allow more realistic decompositions of galaxy subcomponents in the presence of strong rings and spiral arms, and to enable ways to gauge the uncertainties when decomposing galaxy subcomponents. We illustrate these new features by way of several case studies that display various levels of complexity.},

Each galaxy received an average of 40 independent classifications, which we combine into detailed morphological information on galaxy features such as clumpiness, bar instabilities, spiral structure, and merger and tidal signatures. We apply a consensus-based classifier weighting method that preserves classifier independence while effectively down-weighting significantly outlying classifications. After analysing the effect of varying image depth on reported classifications, we also provide depth-corrected classifications which both preserve the information in the deepest observations and also enable the use of classifications at comparable depths across the full survey. Comparing the Galaxy Zoo classifications to previous classifications of the same galaxies shows very good agreement; for some applications the high number of independent classifications provided by Galaxy Zoo provides an advantage in selecting galaxies with a particular morphological profile, while in others the combination of Galaxy Zoo with other classifications is a more promising approach than using any one method alone. We combine the Galaxy Zoo classifications of ``smooth'' galaxies with parametric morphologies to select a sample of featureless disks at 1 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3, which may represent a dynamically warmer progenitor population to the settled disk galaxies seen at later epochs.},

We measure surface brightness profiles for these galaxies using a method that properly measures low surface brightness flux at large radii. We find that quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2 very closely follow Sérsic profiles, with n median = 3.7, and have no excess flux at large radii. Their effective radii are a factor of ~4 smaller than those of low-redshift quiescent galaxies of similar mass. However, there is a significant spread in sizes ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/749/2/121/apj423213ieqn1.gif] {$\sigma _{\log _{10} r_e} = 0.24$} ), with the largest z ~ 2 galaxies lying close to the z = 0 mass-size relation. We compare the stellar mass surface density profiles with those of massive elliptical galaxies in the Virgo Cluster and confirm that most of the mass growth which occurs between z ~ 2 and z = 0 must be due to accretion of material onto the outer regions of the galaxies. Additionally, we investigate the evolution in the size distribution of massive quiescent galaxies. We find that the minimum size growth required for z ~ 2 quiescent galaxies to fall within the z = 0 size distribution is a factor of ~2 smaller than the total median size growth between z ~ 2 and z = 0.},

Our parent sample consists of 3757 face-on disc galaxies with redshifts between 0.01 and 0.05, selected from the seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. 1555 galaxies with bars are identified using the position angle and ellipticity profiles of the i-band light. We compare the ratio of the specific star formation rate measured in the 1-3 kpc central region of the galaxy to that measured for the whole galaxy. Galaxies with strong bars have centrally enhanced star formation; the degree of enhancement depends primarily on the ellipticity of the bar and not on the size of the bar or on the mass or structure of the host galaxy. The fraction of galaxies with strong bars is highest at stellar masses greater than 3 {\times} 10$^{10}$ M$_{⊙}$, stellar surface densities less than 3 {\times} 10$^{8}$ M$_{⊙}$ and concentration indices less than 2.5. In this region of parameter space, galaxies with strong bars either have enhanced central star formation rates, or star formation that is suppressed compared to the mean. This suggests that bars may play a role in the eventual quenching of star formation in galaxies. Only 50 per cent of galaxies with strongly concentrated star formation have strong bars, indicating that other processes such as galaxy interactions also induce central starbursts. We also find that the ratio of the size of the bar to that of the disc depends mainly on the colour of the galaxy, suggesting that the growth and destruction of bars are regulated by gas accretion, as suggested by simulations.},

This sample consists of 133 objects with the 3.6 {$\mu$}m limiting magnitude of [3.6] = 21.5 and is approximately complete for galaxies with M $_{*}$ $\gt$ 10$^{11}$ M $_{⊙}$ at 1.5 $\lt$= z $\lt$= 2.5. We classify this sample into two types, quiescent and star-forming galaxies (SFGs), in the observed infrared color-color ([3.6]-[24] versus K - [3.6]) diagram. The further morphological study of this sample shows a consistent result with the observed color classification. The classified quiescent galaxies are bulge dominated and SFGs in the sample have disk or irregular morphologies. Our observed infrared color classification is also consistent with the rest-frame color (U - V versus V - J) classification. We also found that quiescent and SFGs are well separated in the nonparametric morphology parameter (Gini versus M $_{20}$) diagram measuring their concentration and clumpiness: quiescent galaxies have a Gini coefficient higher than 0.58 and SFGs have a Gini coefficient lower than 0.58. We argue that the star formation quenching process must lead to or be accompanied by the increasing galaxy concentration. One prominent morphological feature of this sample is that disks are commonly seen in this massive galaxy sample at 1.5 $\lt$= z $\lt$= 2.5: 30\% of quiescent galaxies and 70\% of SFGs with M $_{*}$ $\gt$ 10$^{11}$ M $_{⊙}$ have disks in their rest-frame optical morphologies.

Random uncertainties in the measured parameters are estimated for each individual object based on a comparison between multiple, independent measurements of the same set of objects. To quantify systematic uncertainties, we create a mosaic with simulated galaxy images with a realistic distribution of input parameters and then process and analyze the mosaic in an identical manner as the real data.

  abstract      = {We present global structural parameter measurements of 109,533 unique, H $_{F160W}$-selected objects from the CANDELS multi-cycle treasury program. S{\'e}rsic model fits for these objects are produced with GALFIT in all available near-infrared filters (H $_{F160W}$, J $_{F125W}$ and, for a subset, Y $_{F105W}$). The parameters of the best-fitting S{\'e}rsic models (total magnitude, half-light radius, S{\'e}rsic index, axis ratio, and position angle) are made public, along with newly constructed point-spread functions for each field and filter. Random uncertainties in the measured parameters are estimated for each individual object based on a comparison between multiple, independent measurements of the same set of objects. To quantify systematic uncertainties, we create a mosaic with simulated galaxy images with a realistic distribution of input parameters and then process and analyze the mosaic in an identical manner as the real data. We find that accurate and precise measurements{\mdash}to 10\% or better{\mdash}of all structural parameters can typically be obtained for galaxies with H $_{F160W}$ $\lt$ 23, with comparable fidelity for basic size and shape measurements for galaxies to H $_{F160W}$ \~{} 24.5.},

  abstract = {Strong size and internal density evolution of early-type galaxies between z ~ 2 and the present has been reported by several authors. Here we analyze samples of nearby and distant ( z ~ 1) galaxies with dynamically measured masses in order to confirm the previous, model-dependent results and constrain the uncertainties that may play a role. Velocity dispersion (σ) measurements are taken from the literature for 50 morphologically selected 0.8 < z < 1.2 field and cluster early-type galaxies with typical masses M dyn = 2 × 10 11 M ☉ . Sizes ( R eff ) are determined with Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging. We compare the distant sample with a large sample of nearby ( 0.04 < z < 0.08) early-type galaxies extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey for which we determine sizes, masses, and densities in a consistent manner, using simulations to quantify systematic differences between the size measurements of nearby and distant galaxies. We find a highly significant difference between the σ − R eff distributions of the nearby and distant samples, regardless of sample selection effects. The implied evolution in R eff at fixed mass between z = 1 and the present is a factor of 1.97 ± 0.15. This is in qualitative agreement with semianalytic models; however, the observed evolution is much faster than the predicted evolution. Our results reinforce and are quantitatively consistent with previous, photometric studies that found size evolution of up to a factor of 5 since z ~ 2. A combination of structural evolution of individual galaxies through the accretion of companions and the continuous formation of early-type galaxies through increasingly gas-poor mergers is one plausible explanation of the observations.},

  abstract      = {We present a robust method to constrain average galaxy star formation rates (SFRs), star formation histories (SFHs), and the intracluster light (ICL) as a function of halo mass. Our results are consistent with observed galaxy stellar mass functions, specific star formation rates (SSFRs), and cosmic star formation rates (CSFRs) from z = 0 to z = 8. We consider the effects of a wide range of uncertainties on our results, including those affecting stellar masses, SFRs, and the halo mass function at the heart of our analysis. As they are relevant to our method, we also present new calibrations of the dark matter halo mass function, halo mass accretion histories, and halo-subhalo merger rates out to z = 8. We also provide new compilations of CSFRs and SSFRs; more recent measurements are now consistent with the buildup of the cosmic stellar mass density at all redshifts. Implications of our work include: halos near 10$^{12}$ M $_{⊙}$ are the most efficient at forming stars at all redshifts, the baryon conversion efficiency of massive halos drops markedly after z \~{} 2.5 (consistent with theories of cold-mode accretion), the ICL for massive galaxies is expected to be significant out to at least z \~{} 1-1.5, and dwarf galaxies at low redshifts have higher stellar mass to halo mass ratios than previous expectations and form later than in most theoretical models. Finally, we provide new fitting formulae for SFHs that are more accurate than the standard declining tau model. Our approach places a wide variety of observations relating to the SFH of galaxies into a self-consistent framework based on the modern understanding of structure formation in {$\Lambda$}CDM. Constraints on the stellar mass-halo mass relationship and SFRs are available for download online.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift are much more compact than present-day galaxies of the same mass. Here we compare the radial stellar density profiles and the number density of a sample of massive galaxies at z ~ 2.3 to nearby massive elliptical galaxies. We confirm that the average stellar densities of the z ~ 2.3 galaxies within the effective radius, ρ(< r e ), are two orders of magnitude higher than those of local elliptical galaxies of the same stellar mass. However, we also find that the densities measured within a constant physical radius of 1 kpc, ρ(<1 kpc), are higher by a factor of 2-3 only. This suggests that inside-out growth scenarios are plausible, in which the compact high-redshift galaxies make up the centers of normal nearby ellipticals. The compact galaxies are common at high redshift, which enables us to further constrain their evolution by requiring that the number density of their descendants does not exceed constraints imposed by the z = 0 galaxy mass function. We infer that size growth must be efficient, with ( r 1+2 / r 1 ) ~ ( M 1+2 / M 1 ) 2 . A simple model where compact galaxies with masses ~10 11 M ☉ primarily grow through minor mergers produces descendants with the approximate sizes, stellar densities, and number density of elliptical galaxies with masses 2-3 × 10 11 M ☉ in the local universe. We note that this model also predicts evolution in the M BH – σ relation, such that the progenitors of elliptical galaxies have lower black hole masses at fixed velocity dispersion. The main observational uncertainty is the conversion from light to mass; measurements of kinematics are needed to calibrate the masses and stellar densities of the high-redshift galaxies.},

  abstract      = {In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at intermediate redshifts (z {\tilde} 1). We combine the ultra-deep optical spectro-photometric data from the Survey for High-z Absorption Red and Dead Sources (SHARDS) with deep UV-to-FIR observations in the GOODS-N field. Exploiting two of the 25 SHARDS medium-band filters, F687W17 and F823W17, we select [O ii] emission line galaxies at z {\tilde} 0.84 and z {\tilde} 1.23 and characterize their physical properties. Their rest-frame equivalent widths (EW$_{rf}$([O ii])), line fluxes, luminosities, star formation rates (SFRs), and dust attenuation properties are investigated. The evolution of EW$_{rf}$([O ii]) closely follows the SFR density evolution of the universe, with a trend of EW$_{rf}$([O ii]) $\backslash$propto  (1 + z)$^{3}$ up to redshift z {\sime} 1, followed by a possible flattening. The SF properties of the galaxies selected on the basis of their [O ii] emission are compared with complementary samples of SFGs selected by their MIR and FIR emission, and also with a general mass-selected sample of galaxies at the same redshifts. We demonstrate observationally that the UVJ diagram (or, similarly, a cut in the specific SFR) is only partially able to distinguish the quiescent galaxies from the SFGs. The SFR-M$_{*}$ relation is investigated for the different samples, yielding a logarithmic slope {\tilde}1, in good agreement with previous results. The dust attenuations derived from different SFR indicators (UV(1600), UV(2800), [O ii], IR) are compared and show clear trends with respect to both the stellar mass and total SFR, with more massive and highly star-forming galaxies being affected by stronger dust attenuation.},

  abstract      = {This is the first in a series of papers examining the demographics of star-forming galaxies at $0.2\ltz\lt2.5$ in CANDELS. We study 9,100 galaxies from GOODS-S and UDS having published values of redshifts, masses, star-formation rates (SFRs), and dust attenuation ($A\_V$) derived from UV-optical SED fitting. In agreement with previous works, we find that the $UVJ$ colors of a galaxy are closely correlated with its specific star-formation rate (SSFR) and $A\_V$. We define rotated $UVJ$ coordinate axes, termed $S\_\mathrm{SED}$ and $C\_\mathrm{SED}$, that are parallel and perpendicular to the star-forming sequence and derive a quantitative calibration that predicts SSFR from $C\_\mathrm{SED}$ with an accuracy of \~{}0.2 dex. SFRs from UV-optical fitting and from UV+IR values based on Spitzer/MIPS 24 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ agree well overall, but systematic differences of order 0.2 dex exist at high and low redshifts. A novel plotting scheme conveys the evolution of multiple galaxy properties simultaneously, and dust growth, as well as star-formation decline and quenching, exhibit ``mass-accelerated evolution'' (``downsizing''). A population of transition galaxies below the star-forming main sequence is identified. These objects are located between star-forming and quiescent galaxies in $UVJ$ space and have lower $A\_V$ and smaller radii than galaxies on the main sequence. Their properties are consistent with their being in transit between the two regions. The relative numbers of quenched, transition, and star-forming galaxies are given as a function of mass and redshift.},

Our sample contains 164 galaxies down to stellar mass ( M * ) of 10 8.5 M ⊙ in the CANDELS GOODS-N region, where Team Keck Redshift Survey Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy and Hubble Space Telescope /WFC3 F275W images from CANDELS and Hubble Deep UV Legacy Survey are available. When the ratio of H β - and FUV-derived SFRs is measured, dust extinction correction is negligible (except for very dusty galaxies) with the Calzetti attenuation curve. The H β -to-FUV ratio of our sample increases with M * and SFR. The median ratio is ∼0.7 at M * ∼ 10 8.5 M ⊙ (or SFR ∼ 0.5 M ⊙ yr −1 ) and increases to ∼1 at M * ∼ 10 10 M ⊙ (or SFR ∼ 10 M ⊙ yr −1 ). At M * < 10 9.5 M ⊙ , our median H β -to-FUV ratio is lower than that of local galaxies at the same M * , implying a redshift evolution. Bursty SFH on a timescale of a few tens of megayears on galactic scales provides a plausible explanation for our results, and the importance of the burstiness increases as M * decreases. Due to sample selection effects, our H β -to-FUV ratio may be an upper limit of the true value of a complete sample, which strengthens our conclusions. Other models, e.g., non-universal initial mass function or stochastic star formation on star cluster scales, are unable to plausibly explain our results.},

  abstract     = {We propose to take advantage of the nearly all-sky coverage of the Galaxy Evolution Explorer and Wide Field Infrared Surveyor missions to construct a combined atlas of ultraviolet and mid-infrared intensity images for almost all massive galaxies within 40 Mpc as well as several key local galaxy surveys beyond this volume. Following established methodology, we will use these to construct resolved estimates of the star formation rate surface density (the recent rate of star formation per unit area) across the whole local galaxy population. We will then use this atlas to measure basic facts about star formation in the local universe: where are most stars forming? Where are galaxies of different masses and morphologies most rapidly increasing their mass and where are they quenched? How common are ``extreme'' events like nuclear or off-nuclear starbursts? The limited resolution of infrared telescopes has made it difficult to address these questions in large samples before the latest generation of NASA missions. These local galaxies have been, and will remain, the subject of much focused study. The atlas will also serve as a reference point to place smaller samples studied in greater detail into the full context of the galaxy population; for example, we highlight the ability to place detailed studies of gas and dust in moderate-size galaxies into the broader context of galaxy evolution. The prospect to make homogenously constructed, extinction robust, resolved maps of a huge set of galaxies is only now available and offers a powerful chance to link these two fields (nearby galaxy studies and statistical studies of galaxy evolution and population). It will also serve as an invaluable resource to target future detailed studies with telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope that are optimized for extraordinarily detailed study of comparatively small areas and so require the sort of {\ldquo}finding chart{\rdquo} that we propose to produce. This goal of mapping all star formation in the local galaxy population bears directly on NASA's broad goals of understand how the universe works and the origins of stars, planets, and galaxies. This project will also enhance the legacy value of two phenomenal NASA missions by producing a set of broadly useful high level science products and using them to address fundamental scientific questions. It will also aid in targeting of future NASA observations and help place key work by earlier missions in context. It will also be a substantial resource to the community, producing useful data products and serving as a bridge between the often too-separated fields of nearby galaxy studies and galaxy evolution.},

We use a sample of BzK-selected star-forming galaxies, drawn from the Cosmic Evolution Survey, to perform a stacking analysis of their 1.4 GHz radio continuum as a function of different stellar population properties, after cleaning the sample from contamination by active galactic nuclei. Dust unbiased SFRs are derived from radio fluxes assuming the local radio-IR correlation. The main results of this work are: (1) specific star formation rate (SSFR)s are constant over about 1 dex in stellar mass and up to the highest stellar mass probed, (2) the dust attenuation is a strong function of galaxy stellar mass with more massive galaxies being more obscured than lower mass objects, (3) a single value of the UV extinction applied to all galaxies would lead to a gross underestimate of the SFR in massive galaxies, (4) correcting the observed UV luminosities for dust attenuation based on the Calzetti recipe provides results in very good agreement with the radio derived ones, (5) the mean SSFR of our sample steadily decreases by a factor of ~4 with decreasing redshift from z = 2.3 to 1.4 and a factor of ~40 down the local universe. These empirical SFRs would cause galaxies to dramatically overgrow in mass if maintained all the way to low redshifts; we suggest that this does not happen because star formation is progressively quenched, likely starting from the most massive galaxies.},

Our main results can be summarized as follows: (i) the slope of the star-formation rate– M * correlation is consistent with being constant ≃0.8 up to z ≃ 1.5, while its normalization keeps increasing with redshift; (ii) for the first time we are able to explore the FIR–radio correlation for a mass-selected sample of star-forming galaxies: the correlation does not evolve up to z ≃ 4; (iii) we confirm that galaxy stellar mass is a robust proxy for UV dust attenuation in star-forming galaxies, with more massive galaxies being more dust attenuated. Strikingly, we find that this attenuation relation evolves very weakly with redshift, with the amount of dust attenuation increasing by less than 0.3 mag over the redshift range [0.5–4] for a fixed stellar mass; (iv) the correlation between dust attenuation and the UV spectral slope evolves with redshift, with the median UV slope becoming bluer with redshift. By z ≃ 3, typical UV slopes are inconsistent, given the measured dust attenuations, with the predictions of commonly used empirical laws. (v) Finally, building on existing results, we show that gas reddening is marginally larger (by a factor of around 1.3) than the stellar reddening at all redshifts probed. Our results support a scenario where the ISM conditions of typical star-forming galaxies evolve with redshift, such that at z ≥ 1.5 Main Sequence galaxies have ISM conditions moving closer to those of local starbursts.},

MIPS 24 μm photometry can yield SFRs accurately from this luminosity upward: SFR( M ☉ yr –1 ) = 7.8 × 10 –10 L (24 μm, L ☉ ) from L (TIR) = 5× 10 9 L ☉ to 10 11 L ☉ and SFR = 7.8 × 10 –10 L (24 μm, L ☉ )(7.76 × 10 –11 L (24)) 0.048 for higher L (TIR). For galaxies with L (TIR) ≥ 10 10 L ☉ , these new expressions should provide SFRs to within 0.2 dex. For L (TIR) ≥ 10 11 L ☉ , we find that the SFR of infrared galaxies is significantly underestimated using extinction-corrected Paα (and presumably using any other optical or near-infrared recombination lines). As a part of this work, we constructed spectral energy distribution templates for eleven luminous and ultraluminous purely star forming infrared galaxies and over the spectral range 0.4 μm to 30 cm. We use these templates and the SINGS data to construct average templates from 5 μm to 30 cm for infrared galaxies with L (TIR) = 5× 10 9 to 10 13 L ☉ .

Our method is based on characterizing the SEDs of galaxies as a function of their L(TIR) surface density, which is motivated by the indications that the majority of IR luminous star-forming galaxies at 1 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3 have extended star-forming regions, in contrast to the strongly nuclear concentrated, merger-induced starbursts in local luminous and ultraluminous IR galaxies. We validate our procedure for estimating L(TIR) by comparing the resulting L(TIR) with those measured from far-IR observations, such as those from Herschel in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDFS) and Hubble Deep Field North (HDFN), as well as L(TIR) measured from stacked far-IR observations at redshift 0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2.8. Active galactic nuclei were excluded using X-ray and 3.6-8.0 {$\mu$}m observations, which are generally available in deep cosmological survey fields. The Gaussian fits to the distribution of the discrepancies between the L(TIR) measurements from single-band 24 {$\mu$}m and Herschel observations in the ECDFS and HDFN samples have {$\sigma$} $\lt$ 0.1 dex, with \~{}10\% of objects disagreeing by more than 0.2 dex. Since the 24 {$\mu$}m estimates are based on SEDs for extended galaxies, this agreement suggests that \~{}90\% of IR galaxies at high z are indeed much more physically extended than local counterparts of similar L(TIR), consistent with recent independent studies of the fractions of galaxies forming stars in the main-sequence and starburst modes, respectively. Because we have not introduced empirical corrections to enhance these estimates, in principle, our method should be applicable to lower luminosity galaxies. This will enable use of the 21 {$\mu$}m band of the Mid-Infrared Instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope to provide an extremely sensitive tracer of obscured SFR in individual star-forming galaxies across the peak of the cosmic star formation history.},

  abstract      = {Ultraviolet (UV) nonionizing continuum and mid-infrared (IR) emission constitute the basis of two widely used star formation (SF) indicators at intermediate and high redshifts. We study 2430 galaxies with z $\lt$ 1.4 in the Extended Groth Strip with deep MIPS 24 {$\mu$}m observations from FIDEL, spectroscopy from DEEP2, and UV, optical, and near-IR photometry from the AEGIS. The data are coupled with dust-reddened stellar population models and Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to estimate dust-corrected star formation rates (SFRs). In order to probe the dust heating from stellar populations of various ages, the derived SFRs were averaged over various timescales{\mdash}from 100 Myr for ``current'' SFR (corresponding to young stars) to 1-3 Gyr for long-timescale SFRs (corresponding to the light-weighted age of the dominant stellar populations). These SED-based UV/optical SFRs are compared to total IR luminosities extrapolated from 24 {$\mu$}m observations, corresponding to 10-18 {$\mu$}m rest frame. The total IR luminosities are in the range of normal star-forming galaxies and luminous IR galaxies (10$^{10}$-10$^{12}$ L $_{sun}$). We show that the IR luminosity can be estimated from the UV and optical photometry to within a factor of 2, implying that most z $\lt$ 1.4 galaxies are not optically thick. We find that for the blue, actively star-forming galaxies the correlation between the IR luminosity and the UV/optical SFR shows a decrease in scatter when going from shorter to longer SFR-averaging timescales. We interpret this as the greater role of intermediate age stellar populations in heating the dust than what is typically assumed. Equivalently, we observe that the IR luminosity is better correlated with dust-corrected optical luminosity than with dust-corrected UV light. We find that this holds over the entire redshift range. Many so-called green valley galaxies are simply dust-obscured actively star-forming galaxies. However, there exist 24 {$\mu$}m detected galaxies, some with L $_{IR}$$\gt$10$^{11}$ L $_{sun}$, yet with little current SF. For them a reasonable amount of dust absorption of stellar light (but presumably higher than in nearby early-type galaxies) is sufficient to produce the observed levels of IR, which includes a large contribution from intermediate and old stellar populations. In our sample, which contains very few ultraluminous IR galaxies, optical and X-ray active galactic nuclei do not contribute on average more than \~{}50\% to the mid-IR luminosity, and we see no evidence for a large population of ``IR excess'' galaxies.},

A sample is drawn from bulge-dominated Galaxy Evolution Explorer/Sloan Digital Sky Survey (GALEX/SDSS) galaxies on the optical red sequence with strong UV excess and yet quiescent SDSS spectra. High-resolution far-UV imaging of 27 such ETGs using Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys/Solar Blind Channel (ACS/SBC) reveals structured UV morphology in 93\% of the sample, consistent with low-level ongoing SF (\~{}0.5 M $_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$). In 3/4 of the sample the SF is extended on galaxy scales (25-75 kpc), while the rest contains smaller (5-15 kpc) SF patches in the vicinity of an ETG{\mdash}presumably gas-rich satellites being disrupted. Optical imaging reveals that all ETGs with galaxy-scale SF in our sample have old stellar disks (mostly S0 type). None is classified as a true elliptical. In our sample, galaxy-scale SF takes the form of UV rings of varying sizes and morphologies. For the majority of such objects we conclude that the gas needed to fuel current SF has been accreted from the intergalactic medium, probably in a prolonged, quasi-static manner, leading in some cases to additional disk buildup. The remaining ETGs with galaxy-scale SF have UV and optical morphologies consistent with minor merger-driven SF or with the final stages of SF in fading spirals. Our analysis excludes that all recent SF on the red sequence resulted from gas-rich mergers. We find further evidence that galaxy-scale SF is almost exclusively an S0 phenomenon (\~{}20\% S0s have SF) by examining the overall optically red SDSS ETGs. Conclusion is that significant number of field S0s maintain or resume low-level SF because the preventive feedback is not in place or is intermittent. True ellipticals, on the other hand, stay entirely quiescent even in the field.},

We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (ultraviolet) and SDSS photometry to a library of dust-attenuated population synthesis models. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare remarkably well with those from SDSS-measured emission lines (H{$\alpha$}). Deviations from perfect agreement are shown to be due to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to H{$\alpha$} measurements, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak H{$\alpha$}, and where H{$\alpha$} is contaminated with AGN emission (1/2 of the sample). Using full-SED SFRs, we calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX far- and near-UV magnitudes to produce dust-corrected SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGNs, (2) those hosting an AGN, and (3) galaxies without H{$\alpha$} emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGNs lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Star-forming galaxies without an AGN lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. On the other hand, weak AGNs, while also massive, have lower SFRs, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies via strong and weak AGNs. We confirm that some galaxies with no H{$\alpha$} show signs of star formation in the UV. We derive a cosmic star formation density at z=0.1 with significantly smaller total error than previous measurements.},

We use an initial sample of 87 star-forming galaxies with spectroscopic coverage of Hβ, [O III ] λ5007, Hα, and [N II ] λ6584 rest-frame optical emission lines, and estimate the gas-phase oxygen abundance based on the N2 and O3N2 strong-line indicators. We find a positive correlation between stellar mass and metallicity among individual z ~ 2.3 galaxies using both the N2 and O3N2 indicators. We also measure the emission-line ratios and corresponding oxygen abundances for composite spectra in bins of stellar mass. Among composite spectra, we find a monotonic increase in metallicity with increasing stellar mass, offset ~0.15-0.3 dex below the local MZR. When the sample is divided at the median star-formation rate (SFR), we do not observe significant SFR dependence of the z ~ 2.3 MZR among either individual galaxies or composite spectra. We furthermore find that z ~ 2.3 galaxies have metallicities ~0.1 dex lower at a given stellar mass and SFR than is observed locally. This offset suggests that high-redshift galaxies do not fall on the local "fundamental metallicity relation" among stellar mass, metallicity, and SFR, and may provide evidence of a phase of galaxy growth in which the gas reservoir is built up due to inflow rates that are higher than star-formation and outflow rates. However, robust conclusions regarding the gas-phase oxygen abundances of high-redshift galaxies await a systematic reappraisal of the application of locally calibrated metallicity indicators at high redshift.},

  abstract      = {<BR /> Aims: We aim to test the impact of using variable star-forming histories (SFHs) and the IR luminosity as a constrain on the physical parameters of high redshift dusty star-forming galaxies. We explore in particular the properties (SFHs, ages, timescales) of galaxies depending on their belonging to the ``main sequence'' of star-forming galaxies (MS). <BR /> Methods: We performed spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of the UV-to-NIR and FIR emissions of a moderately large sample of GOODS-Herschel galaxies, for which rich multi-wavelength, optical to IR observations are available. We tested different SFHs and the impact of imposing energy conservation in the SED fitting process, to help with issues like the age-extinction degeneracy and produce SEDs consistent with observations. <BR /> Results: Our simple models produce well constrained SEDs for the broad majority of the sample (84\%), with the notable exception of the very high L$_{IR}$ end, for which we have indications that the energy conservation hypothesis cannot hold true for a single component population approach. We observe trends in the preferences in SFHs among our sources depending on stellar mass M$_{⋆}$ and z. Trends also emerge in the characteristic timescales of the SED models depending on the location on the SFR - M$_{⋆}$ diagram. We show that whilst using the same available observational data, we can produce galaxies less star-forming than classically inferred, if we allow rapidly declining SFHs, while properly reproducing their observables. These sources, representing 7\% of the sample, can be post-starbursts undergoing quenching, and their SFRs are potentially overestimated if inferred from their L$_{IR}$. Based on the trends observed in the rising SFH fits we explore a simple evolution model for stellar mass build-up over the considered time period. <BR /> Conclusions: Our approach successfully breaks the age-extinction degeneracy, and enables to evaluate properly the SFRs of the sources in the SED fitting process. Fitting without the IR constrain leads to a strong preference for declining SFHs, while its inclusion increases the preference of rising SFHs, more so at high z, in tentative agreement with the cosmic star-formation history (CSFH), although this result suffers from poor statistics. Keeping in mind that the sample is biased toward high luminosities and intense star formation, the evolution shaped by our model appears as both bursty (in its early stages) and steady-lasting (later on). The SFH of the sample considered as a whole follows the CSFH with a surprisingly small scatter, and is compatible with other studies supporting that the more massive galaxies have built most of their mass earlier than lower mass galaxies.},

After converting all observations to a common set of calibrations, we find a remarkable consensus among MS observations (~0.1 dex 1σ interpublication scatter). By fitting for time evolution of the MS in bins of constant mass, we deconvolve the observed scatter about the MS within each observed redshift bin. After accounting for observed scatter between different SFR indicators, we find the width of the MS distribution is ~0.2 dex and remains constant over cosmic time. Our best fits indicate the slope of the MS is likely time-dependent, with our best-fit log SFR( M * , t ) = (0.84 ± 0.02 – 0.026 ± 0.003 × t )log M * – (6.51 ± 0.24 – 0.11 ± 0.03 × t ), where t is the age of the universe in Gyr. We use our fits to create empirical evolutionary tracks in order to constrain MS galaxy star formation histories (SFHs), finding that (1) the most accurate representations of MS SFHs are given by delayed-τ models, (2) the decline in fractional stellar mass growth for a "typical" MS galaxy today is approximately linear for most of its lifetime, and (3) scatter about the MS can be generated by galaxies evolving along identical evolutionary tracks assuming an initial 1σ spread in formation times of ~1.4 Gyr.},

The roles of secular and environmental quenching processes are investigated by studying the dependence of the radial profiles of specific star formation rate on stellar mass, galaxy structure, and environment. We report on the existence of `centrally suppressed' galaxies, which have suppressed Specific Star Formation Rate (SSFR) in their cores compared to their discs. The profiles of centrally suppressed and unsuppressed galaxies are distributed in a bimodal way. Galaxies with high stellar mass and core velocity dispersion are found to be much more likely to be centrally suppressed than low-mass galaxies, and we show that this is related to morphology and the presence of AGN/LI(N)ER like emission. Centrally suppressed galaxies also display lower star formation at all radii compared to unsuppressed galaxies. The profiles of central and satellite galaxies are also compared, and we find that satellite galaxies experience lower specific star formation rates at all radii than central galaxies. This uniform suppression could be a signal of the stripping of hot halo gas in the process known as strangulation. We find that satellites are not more likely to be suppressed in their cores than centrals, indicating that the core suppression is an entirely internal process. We find no correlation between the local environment density and the profiles of star formation rate surface density.},

By fitting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to 10-band photometry (0.4 micron $\lt$ lambda(obs) $\lt$8 micron) and measuring 24 micron fluxes for the 12 spectroscopically confirmed and 80 photometrically selected members, we discover an exceptionally high level of star formation in the cluster core of \~{}1700 Msun/yr per Mpc\^{}2. The cluster galaxies define a strong blue sequence in (U-V) color and span a range in color. We identify 17 members with L(IR)$\gt$10\^{}(11) Lsun, and these IR luminous members follow the same trend of increasing star formation with stellar mass that is observed in the field at z\~{}2. Using rates derived from both the 24 micron imaging and SED fitting, we find that the relative fraction of star-forming members triples from the lowest to highest galaxy density regions, e.g. the IR luminous fraction increases from \~{}8\% at Sigma\~{}10 gal per Mpc\^{}2 to \~{}25\% at Sigma$\gt$100 gal per Mpc\^{}2. The observed increase is a reversal of the well-documented trend at z$\lt$1 and signals that we have reached the epoch when massive cluster galaxies are still forming a substantial fraction of their stars.},

These composite SEDs were previously constructed from the photometric catalogs of the NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey by stacking the observed photometry of galaxies that have similar rest-frame NUV-to-NIR SEDs. In this work, we include a stacked MIPS 24 μm measurement for each SED type to extend the SEDs to rest-frame MIR wavelengths. Consistent with previous studies, the observed MIR emission for most SED types is higher than expected from only the attenuated stellar emission. We fit the NUV-to-MIR composite SEDs with the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis (FSPS) models, which include both stellar and dust emission. We compare the best-fit star formation rates (SFRs) to the SFRs based on simple UV+IR estimators. Interestingly, the UV and IR luminosities overestimate SFRs—compared to the model SFRs—by more than ~1 dex for quiescent galaxies, while for the highest star-forming galaxies in our sample the two SFRs are broadly consistent. The difference in specific SFRs also shows a gradually increasing trend with declining specific SFR, implying that quiescent galaxies have even lower specific SFRs than previously found. Contributions from evolved stellar populations to both the UV and the MIR SEDs most likely explain the discrepancy. Based on this work, we conclude that SFRs should be determined from modeling the attenuated stellar and dust emission simultaneously, instead of employing simple UV+IR-based SFR estimators.},

  abstract      = {We propose a new model for the ignition of star formation in low-mass halos by a self-sustaining shock front in cosmic filaments at high redshifts. The gaseous fuel for star formation resides in low mass halos which can not cool on their own due to their primordial composition and low virial temperatures. We show that star formation can be triggered in these filaments by a passing shock wave. The shells swept-up by the shock cool and fragment into cold clumps that form massive stars via thermal instability on a timescale shorter than the front's dynamical timescale. The shock, in turn, is self-sustained by energy injection from supernova explosions. The star formation front is analogous to a detonation wave, which drives exothermic reactions powering the shock. We find that sustained star formation would typically propel the front to a speed of $\sim 300-700\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$ during the epoch of reionization. Future observations by the $\textit{James Webb Space Telescope}$ could reveal the illuminated regions of cosmic filaments, and constrain the initial mass function of stars in them.},

  abstract = {I present here parallel investigations of star formation in typical and extreme galaxies. The typical galaxies are selected to be free of active galactic nuclei (AGN), while the extreme galaxies host quasars (the most luminous class of AGN). These two environments are each insightful in their own way; quasars are among the most violent objects in the universe, literally reshaping their host galaxies, while my sample of AGN-free star-forming galaxies ranges from systems larger than the Milky Way to small galaxies which are forming stars at unsustainably high rates. The current paradigm of galaxy formation and evolution suggests that extreme circumstances are key stepping stones in the assembly of galaxies like our Milky Way. To test this paradigm and fully explore its ramifications, this dual approach is needed. My sample of AGN-free galaxies is drawn from the KPNO International Spectroscopic Survey. This Halpha-selected, volume-limited survey was designed to detect star-forming galaxies without a bias toward continuum luminosity. This type of selection ensures that this sample is not biased toward galaxies that are large or nearby. My work studies the KISS galaxies in the mid- and far-infrared using photometry from the IRAC and MIPS instruments aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. These infrared bands are particularly interesting for star formation studies because the ultraviolet light from young stars is reprocessed into thermal emission in the far-infrared (24mum MIPS) by dust and into vibrational transitions features in the mid-infrared (8.0mum IRAC) by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The work I present here examines the efficiencies of PAH and thermal dust emission as tracers of star-formation rates over a wide range of galactic stellar masses. I find that the efficiency of PAH as a star-formation tracer varies with galactic stellar mass, while thermal dust has a highly variable efficiency that does not systematically depend on galactic stellar mass. Complementing this study of normal star-forming galaxies, my study of quasar host galaxies utilizes narrow- and medium-band images of eight Palomar-Green (PG) quasars from the WFPC2 and NICMOS instruments aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. Using images of a point-spread function (PSF) star in the same filters, I subtract the PSF of the quasar from each of the target images. The residual light images clearly show the host galaxies of the respective quasars. The narrow-band images were chosen to be centered on the Hbeta, [O II ], [O III], and Paalpha emission lines, allowing the use of line ratios and luminosities to create extinction and star formation maps. Additionally, I utilize the line-ratio maps to distinguish AGN-powered line emission from star formation powered line emission with line-diagnostic diagrams. I find star formation in each of the eight quasar host galaxies in my study. The bulk star-formation rates are lower than expected, suggesting that quasar host galaxies may be dynamically more advanced than previously believed. Seven of the eight quasar host galaxies in this study have higher-than-typical mass-specific star-formation rates. Additionally, I see evidence of shocked gas, supporting the hypotheses presented in earlier works that suggest that AGN activity quenches star formation in its host galaxy by disrupting its gas reservoir.},

We show that the relation between dust extinction and SFR changes with stellar mass. For galaxies at the same stellar mass, dust extinction is anti- correlated with the SFR at stellar masses <10 10 M ☉ . There is a sharp transition in the relation at a stellar mass of 10 10 M ☉ . At larger stellar masses, dust extinction is positively correlated with the SFR for galaxies at the same stellar mass. The observed relation between stellar mass, dust extinction, and SFR presented in this study helps to confirm similar trends observed in the relation between stellar mass, metallicity, and SFR. The relation reported in this study provides important new constraints on the physical processes governing the chemical evolution of galaxies. The correlation between SFR and dust extinction for galaxies with stellar masses >10 10 M ☉ is shown to extend to the population of quiescent galaxies suggesting that the physical processes responsible for the observed relation between stellar mass, dust extinction, and SFR may be related to the processes leading to the shutdown of star formation in galaxies.},

Recent advances in evolutionary synthesis models have given new breath to this old field of research. Modern spectral synthesis techniques incorporating these advances now allow the fitting of galaxy spectra on an {\AA}-by-{\AA}. These detailed fits are useful for a number of studies, like emission line, stellar kinematics, and specially galaxy evolution. Applications of this semi-empirical approach to mega data sets are teaching us a lot about the lives of galaxies. The STARLIGHT spectral synthesis code is one of the tools which allows one to harness this favorable combination of plentifulness of data and models. To illustrate this, we show how SFHs vary across classical emission line diagnostic diagrams. Systematic trends are present along both the star-forming and active-galaxy sequences. We also briefly describe experiments with new versions of evolutionary synthesis models. Last but not least, we announce the public availability of both STARLIGHT and a database of detailed spectral fits and related products for over half a million galaxies from the SDSS. This facility allows more physically inspired explorations of the parameter space than is possible in terms of raw observed properties, offering new ways to navigate through the realm of galaxies.},

  abstract      = {[abridged] Building upon a previous study, we define a method to blindly identify galaxies that underwent, and may still be undergoing, a fast downfall of their star-formation activity, that is, a more than 80\% drop in star-formation rate (SFR) occurring in less than 500 Myr. Modeling galaxies' SED with a delayed-$\tau$ star formation history (SFH), with and without allowing an instantaneous SFR drop within the last hundreds Myr, we isolate 102 candidates out of a subsample of 6,680 galaxies classified as star-forming from the UVJ criterion in the ZFOURGE catalogues. These galaxies are mostly located in the lower part of the SFR-M$\_*$ main sequence (MS) and extend up to a factor 100 below it. They also lie close to the limit between the passive and active regions on the UVJ diagram, indicating that they are in a transition phase. We show that the selected candidates have different physical properties compared to galaxies with similar UVJ colors, namely, lower star-formation rates and different stellar masses. The morphology of the candidates show no preference for a particular type. Among the 102 candidates, only 4 show signs of an AGN activity (from X-ray luminosity or UV-IR SED fitting decomposition). This low fraction of AGNs among the candidates implies that AGN activity may not be the main driver of the recent downfall, although timescale differences and duty cycle must be taken into account. We finally attempt to recover the past position of these galaxies on the SFR-M$\_*$ plane, before the downfall of their star-formation and show that some of them were in the starburst region before and are back on the MS. These candidates constitute a promising sample that need more investigation in order to understand the different mechanisms at the origin of the star formation decrease of the Universe since $z$$\sim$2.},

  abstract = { Over the past two decades, an avalanche of new data from multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic surveys has revolutionized our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic “dark ages” to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z≈1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25\% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25\% formed after z = 0.7. Less than ∼1\% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization. },

After recalibrating star formation measures, we are able to reliably measure specific star formation rates well below that of the so-called {\ldquo}main sequence{\rdquo} of star formation versus mass. We find an unexpectedly large population of quiescent galaxies with star formation rates intermediate between the main sequence and passive populations and with disproportionately high star formation rates. We demonstrate that a tight main sequence is a natural outcome of most histories of star formation and has little astrophysical significance but that the quiescent population requires additional astrophysics to explain its properties. Using a simple model for disk evolution based on the observed dependence of star formation on gas content in local galaxies, and assuming simple histories of cold gas inflow, we show that the evolution of galaxies away from the main sequence can be attributed to the depletion of gas due to star formation after a cutoff of gas inflow. The quiescent population is composed of galaxies in which the density of disk gas has fallen below a threshold for star formation probably set by disk stability. The evolution of galaxies beyond the quiescent state to gas exhaustion and the end of star formation requires another process, probably wind-driven mass loss. The environmental dependence of the three galaxy populations is consistent with recent numerical modeling, which indicates that cold gas inflows into galaxies are truncated at earlier epochs in denser environments.},

  abstract = {We present evidence that bona fide disks and starburst systems occupy distinct regions in the gas mass versus star formation rate (SFR) plane, both for the integrated quantities and for the respective surface densities. This result is based on carbon monoxide (CO) observations of galaxy populations at low and high redshifts, and on the current consensus for the CO luminosity to gas mass conversion factors. The data suggest the existence of two different SF regimes: a long-lasting mode for disks and a more rapid mode for starbursts, the latter probably occurring during major mergers or in dense nuclear SF regions. Both modes are observable over a large range of SFRs. The detection of CO emission from distant near-IR selected galaxies reveals such bimodal behavior for the first time, as they allow us to probe gas in disk galaxies with much higher SFRs than are seen locally. The different regimes can potentially be interpreted as the effect of a top-heavy initial mass function in starbursts. However, we favor a different physical origin related to the fraction of molecular gas in dense clouds. The IR luminosity to gas mass ratio (i.e., the SF efficiency) appears to be inversely proportional to the dynamical (rotation) timescale. Only when accounting for the dynamical timescale, a universal SF law is obtained, suggesting a direct link between global galaxy properties and the local SFR.},

We estimate SFR, M* from broadband Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) and the best available redshifts. The maximum depth of the HUDF photometry (F160W 29.9 AB, 5 sigma depth) probes the SFR-M* correlation down to M* \~{} 10 \^{}7 Msun, a factor of 10-100X lower in M* than previous studies, and comparable to dwarf galaxies in the local universe. We find the slope of the SFR-M* relationship to be near unity at all redshifts and the normalization to decrease with cosmic time. We find a moderate increase in intrinsic scatter with cosmic time from 0.2 to 0.4 dex across the epoch of peak cosmic star formation. None of our redshift bins show a statistically significant increase in intrinsic scatter at low mass. However, it remains possible that intrinsic scatter increases at low mass on timescales shorter than \~{} 100 Myr. Our results are consistent with a picture of gradual and self-similar assembly of galaxies across more than three orders of magnitude in stellar mass from as low as 10\^{}7 Msun.},

Using new far-infrared photometry from Herschel-PACS and SPIRE and Spitzer-MIPS 24 {$\mu$}m, along with derived infrared luminosities from the NRK method based on galaxies' locations in the restframe color-color diagram (NUV - r) versus (r - K), we are able to more accurately determine total SFRs for our complete sample. At all redshifts, the relationship between median SFR and M $_{*}$ follows a power law at low stellar masses, and flattens to nearly constant SFR at high stellar masses. We describe a new parameterization that provides the best fit to the main sequence and characterizes the low mass power-law slope, turnover mass, and overall scaling. The turnover in the main sequence occurs at a characteristic mass of about M $_{0}$ \~{} 10$^{10}$ M $_{⊙}$ at all redshifts. The low mass power-law slope ranges from 0.9-1.3 and the overall scaling rises in SFR as a function of (1 + z)$^{4.12 ± 0.10}$. A broken power-law fit below and above the turnover mass gives relationships of SFR $\backslash$propto M$_{*}$$^{0.88 +/- 0.06}$ below the turnover mass and SFR $\backslash$propto M$_{*}$$^{0.27 +/- 0.04}$ above the turnover mass.

  abstract = {Observationally, a massive disk galaxy can harbor a bulge component that is comparably inactive as a quiescent galaxy. It has been speculated that the quenched component contained in star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is the reason why the star formation main sequence (MS) has a shallow slope at high masses. In this paper, we present a toy model to quantify the quenched mass portion of SFGs ( f Q ) at fixed stellar mass ( M * ) and to reconcile the MS slopes in both the low- and the high-mass regimes. In this model, each SFG is composed of a star-forming plus a quenched component. The mass of the star-forming component ( M SF ) correlates with the star formation rate (SFR) following a relation SFR ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/834/1/39/apjaa4e3cieqn1.gif] {$\propto \,{M}_{\mathrm{SF}}^{{\alpha }_{\mathrm{SF}}}$} , where α SF ∼ 1.0. The quenched component contributes to the stellar mass but not to the SFR. It is thus possible to quantify f Q based on the departure of the observed MS slope α from α SF . Adopting the redshift-dependent MS slope reported by Whitaker et al., we explore the evolution of the ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/834/1/39/apjaa4e3cieqn2.gif] {${f}_{{\rm{Q}}}\mbox{--}{M}_{* }$} relations over z = [0.5, 2.5]. We find that Milky Way-like SFGs (with ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/834/1/39/apjaa4e3cieqn3.gif] {${M}_{* }\approx {10}^{10.7}\,{M}_{\odot }$} ) typically have an f Q = 30%–40% at z ∼ 2.25, whereas this value rapidly rises up to 70%–80% at z ∼ 0.75. The origin of an α ∼ 1.0 MS slope seen in the low-mass regime is also discussed. We argue for a scenario in which the majority of low-mass SFGs stay in a “steady-stage” star formation phase. In this phase, the SFR is mainly regulated by stellar feedback and not significantly influenced by the quenching mechanisms, thus remaining roughly constant over cosmic time. This scenario successfully produces an α ∼ 1.0 MS slope, as well as the observed MS evolution from z = 2.5 to z = 0 at low masses.},

  abstract      = {Deep far-infrared (FIR) cosmological surveys are known to be affected by source confusion, causing issues when examining the main sequence (MS) of star forming galaxies. This has typically been partially tackled by the use of stacking. However, stacking only provides the average properties of the objects in the stack. This work aims to trace the MS over $0.2\leq z\lt6.0$ using the latest de-blended Herschel photometry, which reaches $\approx10$ times deeper than the 5$\sigma$ confusion limit in SPIRE. This provides more reliable star formation rates (SFRs), especially for the fainter galaxies, and hence a more reliable MS. We built a pipeline that uses the spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling and fitting tool CIGALE to generate flux density priors in the Herschel SPIRE bands. These priors were then fed into the de-blending tool XID+ to extract flux densities from the SPIRE maps. Multi-wavelength data were combined with the extracted SPIRE flux densities to constrain SEDs and provide stellar mass (M$\_{\star}$) and SFRs. These M$\_{\star}$ and SFRs were then used to populate the SFR-M$\_{\star}$ plane over $0.2\leq z\lt6.0$. No significant evidence of a high-mass turn-over was found; the best fit is thus a simple two-parameter power law of the form log(SFR)$=\alpha[$log(M$\_{\star})-10.5]+\beta$. The normalisation of the power law increases with redshift, rapidly at $z\lesssim1.8$, from $0.58\pm0.09$ at $z\approx0.37$ to $1.31\pm0.08$ at $z\approx1.8$. The slope is also found to increase with redshift, perhaps with an excess around $1.8\leq z\lt2.9$. The increasing slope indicates that galaxies become more self-similar as redshift increases, implying that the specific SFR of high-mass galaxies increases over $z=0.2$ to $z=6.0$, becoming closer to that of low-mass galaxies. The excess in the slope at $1.8\leq z\lt2.9$, if present, coincides with the peak of the cosmic star formation history.},

Galaxies above the main sequence (MS) have larger gas masses but are converting their ISM into stars on a timescale only slightly shorter than those on the MS; thus, these “starbursts” are largely the result of having greatly increased gas masses rather than an increased efficiency of converting gas to stars. At z > 1, the entire population of star-forming galaxies has ∼2–5 times shorter gas depletion times than low- z galaxies. These shorter depletion times indicate a different mode of star formation in the early universe—most likely dynamically driven by compressive, high-dispersion gas motions—a natural consequence of the high gas accretion rates.},

We quantify the difference by measuring star formation rate (SFR) and star formation efficiency (SFE) at a scale where local star formation is spatially resolved. Our CO map covers the central 2farcm3 region of the galaxy; the combination of NRO45 and CARMA provides a high fidelity image, enabling accurate measurements of molecular gas surface density. We find that SFR and SFE are twice as high in the spiral arms as in the bar. We discuss this difference in the context of the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) law, which indicates a constant SFR at a given gas surface density. The KS law breaks down at our native resolution (\~{}250 pc), and substantial smoothing (to 500 pc) is necessary to reproduce the KS law, although with greater scatter.},

  abstract      = {We present optical photometry of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ACS/WFC data of the resolved stellar populations in the outer disc of the dwarf irregular galaxy DDO 154. The photometry reveals that young main sequence stars are almost absent from the outermost HI disc. Instead, most are clustered near the main stellar component of the galaxy. We constrain the stellar initial mass function (IMF) by comparing the luminosity function of the main sequence stars to simulated stellar populations assuming a constant star formation rate over the dynamical timescale. The best-fitting IMF is deficient in high mass stars compared to a canonical Kroupa IMF, with a best-fit slope $\alpha = -2.45$ and upper mass limit $M\_U = 16\ M\_{\odot}$. This top-light IMF is consistent with predictions of the Integrated Galaxy-wide IMF theory. Combining the HST images with HI data from The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury (THINGS) we determine the star formation law (SFL) in the outer disc. The fit has a power law exponent $N = 2.92 \pm0.22$ and zero point $A=4.47 \pm 0.65 \times 10^{-7} \ M\_{\odot} \ \text{yr}^{-1} \ \text{kpc}^{-2}$. This is depressed compared to the Kennicutt-Schmidt Star Formation Law, but consistent with weak star formation observed in diffuse HI environments. Extrapolating the SFL over the outer disc implies that there could be significant star formation occurring that is not detectable in H$\alpha$. Last, we determine the Toomre stability parameter $Q$ of the outer disc of DDO 154 using the THINGS HI rotation curve and velocity dispersion map. 72\% of the HI in our field has $Q\leq 4$ and this incorporates 96\% of the observed MS stars. Hence 28\% of the HI in the field is largely dormant.},

  abstract    = {The star formation (SFH) and chemical enrichment (CEH) histories of Local Group galaxies are traditionally studied by analyzing their resolved stellar populations in a form of color-magnitude diagrams obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. Star clusters can be studied in integrated light using ground-based telescopes to much larger distances. They represent snapshots of chemical evolution of their host galaxy at different ages. Here we present a simple theoretical framework for the chemical evolution based on the instantaneous recycling approximation (IRA) model. We infer a CEH from a SFH and vice versa using observational data. We also present a more advanced model for the evolution of individual chemical elements which takes into account the contribution of supernovae type Ia. We demonstrate that ages, iron and $\alpha$-element abundances of 15 star clusters derived from fitting of their integrated optical spectra reliably trace the CEH of the Large Magellanic Cloud obtained from resolved stellar populations in the age range 40Myr$<t<$3.5Gyr. The CEH predicted by our model from the global SFH of the LMC agrees remarkably well with the observed cluster age-metallicity relation. Moreover, the present day total gas mass of the LMC estimated by the IRA model ($6.2\cdot10^8 M_{\odot}$) matches within uncertainties the observed HI mass corrected for the presence of molecular gas ($5.8\pm0.5\cdot10^8 M_{\odot}$). We briefly discuss how our approach can be used to study SFHs of galaxies as distant as 10Mpc at the level of detail that is currently available only in a handful of nearby Milky Way satellites.},

  abstract = {We present abundance measurements from 26 emission-line-selected galaxies at z ~ 0.6-0.7. By reaching stellar masses as low as 10 8 M ☉ , these observations provide the first measurement of the intermediate-redshift mass-metallicity (MZ) relation below 10 9 M ☉ . For the portion of our sample above M > 10 9 M ☉ (8/26 galaxies), we find good agreement with previous measurements of the intermediate-redshift MZ relation. Compared to the local relation, we measure an evolution that corresponds to a 0.12 dex decrease in oxygen abundances at intermediate redshifts. This result confirms the trend that metallicity evolution becomes more significant toward lower stellar masses, in keeping with a downsizing scenario where low-mass galaxies evolve onto the local MZ relation at later cosmic times. We show that these galaxies follow the local fundamental metallicity relation, where objects with higher specific (mass-normalized) star formation rates (SFRs) have lower metallicities. Furthermore, we show that the galaxies in our sample lie on an extrapolation of the SFR- M * relation (the star-forming main sequence). Leveraging the MZ relation and star-forming main sequence (and combining our data with higher-mass measurements from the literature), we test models that assume an equilibrium between mass inflow, outflow, and star formation. We find that outflows are required to describe the data. By comparing different outflow prescriptions, we show that momentum, driven winds can describe the MZ relation; however, this model underpredicts the amount of star formation in low-mass galaxies. This disagreement may indicate that preventive feedback from gas heating has been overestimated, or it may signify a more fundamental deviation from the equilibrium assumption.},

  abstract      = {We present the first robust measurement of the high redshift mass-metallicity (MZ) relation at 10$^{8}$ $\lt$\~{} M/M $_{⊙}$ $\lt$\~{} 10$^{10}$, obtained by stacking spectra of 83 emission-line galaxies with secure redshifts between 1.3 $\lt$\~{} z $\lt$\~{} 2.3. For these redshifts, infrared grism spectroscopy with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 is sensitive to the R $_{23}$ metallicity diagnostic: ([O II] {$\lambda$}{$\lambda$}3726, 3729 + [O III] {$\lambda$}{$\lambda$}4959, 5007)/H{$\beta$}. Using spectra stacked in four mass quartiles, we find a MZ relation that declines significantly with decreasing mass, extending from 12+log(O/H) = 8.8 at M = 10$^{9.8}$ M $_{⊙}$, to 12+log(O/H) = 8.2 at M = 10$^{8.2}$ M $_{⊙}$. After correcting for systematic offsets between metallicity indicators, we compare our MZ relation to measurements from the stacked spectra of galaxies with M $\gt$\~{} 10$^{9.5}$ M $_{⊙}$ and z \~{} 2.3. Within the statistical uncertainties, our MZ relation agrees with the z \~{} 2.3 result, particularly since our somewhat higher metallicities (by around 0.1 dex) are qualitatively consistent with the lower mean redshift (z = 1.76) of our sample. For the masses probed by our data, the MZ relation shows a steep slope which is suggestive of feedback from energy-driven winds, and a cosmological downsizing evolution where high mass galaxies reach the local MZ relation at earlier times. In addition, we show that our sample falls on an extrapolation of the star-forming main sequence (the SFR-M $_{*}$ relation) at this redshift. This result indicates that grism emission-line selected samples do not have preferentially high star formation rates (SFRs). Finally, we report no evidence for evolution of the mass-metallicity-SFR plane; our stack-averaged measurements show excellent agreement with the local relation.

  abstract      = {In our previous work, we found that only two scenarios are capable of reproducing the observed integrated mass-metallicity relations for the gas and stellar components of local star-forming galaxies simultaneously. One scenario invokes a time-dependent metal outflow loading factor with stronger outflows at early times. The other scenario uses a time-dependent initial mass function (IMF) slope with a steeper IMF at early times. In this work, we extend our study to investigate the radial profile of gas and stellar metallicity in local star-forming galaxies using spatially resolved spectroscopic data from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. We find that most galaxies show negative gradients in both gas and stellar metallicity with steeper gradients in stellar metallicity. The stellar metallicity gradients tend to be mass dependent with steeper gradients in more massive galaxies while no clear mass dependence is found for the gas metallicity gradient. Then we compare the observations with the predictions from a chemical evolution model of the radial profiles of gas and stellar metallicities. We confirm that the two scenarios proposed in our previous work are also required to explain the metallicity gradients. Based on these two scenarios, we successfully reproduce the radial profiles of gas metallicity, stellar metallicity, stellar mass surface density, and star formation rate surface density simultaneously. The origin of the negative gradient in stellar metallicity turns out to be driven by either radially dependent metal outflow or IMF slope. In contrast, the radial dependence of the gas metallicity is less constrained because of the degeneracy in model parameters.},

  title       = {Chemical enrichment in isolated barred spiral galaxies},
  abstract    = {To investigate the role of bars in the chemical evolution of isolated disc galaxies, we performed a series of 39 gas dynamical simulations of isolated barred and unbarred galaxies with various masses, initial gas fractions, and AGN feedback models. The presence of a bar drives a substantial amount of gas toward the central region of the galaxy. In the most massive galaxies, this results in a violent starburst, followed by a drop in star formation resulting from gas exhaustion. The time delay between Type Ia and Type II supernovae explosions means that barred galaxies experience a rapid increase in [O/H] in the central region, and a much more gradual increase in [Fe/H]. In unbarred galaxies, star formation proceeds at a slow and steady rate, and oxygen and iron are produced at steady rates which are similar except for a time offset. Comparing the abundance ratios in barred and unbarred galaxies with the same central stellar mass $M_*$, we find in barred galaxies an enhancement of 0.07 dex in [O/H], 0.05 dex in [Fe/H], and 0.05 dex in [O/Fe]. The [O/H] enhancement is in excellent agreement with observations from the SDSS. The initial gas fraction has very little effect on the abundance ratios in barred and unbarred galaxies, unless the galaxies experience a starburst. We considered AGN-host galaxies located near the bottom of the AGN regime, $M_*>3\times10^{10}M_\odot$, where AGN feedback dominates over supernovae feedback. We found that the impact of AGN feedback on the central abundances is marginal.},

  abstract      = {We use a sample of 90 spectroscopically confirmed Lyman break galaxies with H{$\alpha$} measurements and Spitzer MIPS 24 {$\mu$}m observations to constrain the relationship between rest-frame 8 {$\mu$}m luminosity (L $_{8}$) and star formation rate (SFR) for L* galaxies at z \~{} 2. We find a tight correlation with 0.24 dex scatter between L $_{8}$ and H{$\alpha$} luminosity/SFR for z \~{} 2 galaxies with 10$^{10}$ L $_{sun}$ $\lt$\~{} L $_{IR}$ $\lt$\~{} 10$^{12}$ L $_{sun}$. Employing this relationship with a larger sample of 392 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, we find that the UV slope {$\beta$} can be used to recover the dust attenuation of the vast majority of moderately luminous L* galaxies at z \~{} 2 to within a 0.4 dex scatter using the local correlation. Separately, young galaxies with ages lsim100 Myr appear to be less dusty than their UV slopes would imply based on the local trend and may follow an extinction curve that is steeper than what is typically assumed. Consequently, very young galaxies at high redshift may be significantly less dusty than inferred previously. Our results provide the first direct evidence, independent of the UV slope, for a correlation between UV and bolometric luminosity (L $_{bol}$) at high redshift, in the sense that UV-faint galaxies are on average less infrared and less bolometrically luminous than their UV-bright counterparts. The L $_{bol}$-L $_{UV}$ relation indicates that as the SFR increases, L $_{UV}$ turns over (or ``saturates'') around the value of L* at z \~{} 2, implying that dust obscuration may be largely responsible for modulating the bright end of the UV luminosity function. Finally, dust attenuation is found to correlate with oxygen abundance at z \~{} 2. Accounting for systematic differences in local and high-redshift metallicity calibrations, we find that L* galaxies at z \~{} 2, while at least an order of magnitude more bolometrically luminous, exhibit ratios of metals to dust that are similar to those of local starbursts. This result is expected if high-redshift galaxies are forming their stars in a less metal-rich environment compared to local galaxies of the same luminosity, thus naturally leading to a redshift evolution in both the bolometric luminosity-metallicity and bolometric luminosity-obscuration relations.

We determine stellar masses by fitting the spectral energy distribution inferred from photometry with current stellar population synthesis models. This work raises the number of galaxies with metallicities at z ~0.8 by more than an order of magnitude. We investigate the evolution in the MZ and LZ relations in comparison with local MZ and LZ relations determined in a consistent manner using ~21, 000 galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We show that high stellar mass galaxies ( M ~ 10 10.6 M ☉ ) at z ~0.8 have attained the chemical enrichment seen in the local universe, while lower stellar mass galaxies ( M ~ 10 9.2 M ☉ ) at z ~0.8 have lower metallicities (Δlog(O/H) ~ 0.15 dex) than galaxies at the same stellar mass in the local universe. We find that the LZ relation evolves in both metallicity and B -band luminosity between z ~0.8 and z ~ 0, with the B -band luminosity evolving as a function of stellar mass. We emphasize that the B -band luminosity should not be used as a proxy for stellar mass in chemical evolution studies of star-forming galaxies. Our study shows that both the metallicity evolution and the B -band luminosity evolution for emission-line galaxies between the epochs are a function of stellar mass, consistent with the cosmic downsizing scenario of galaxy evolution.},

The color distribution is well fitted with two Gaussian distributions, which we use to divide the sample into a blue and red population. At fixed luminosity, the mean color of the blue (red) distribution is nearly independent of environment, with a weakly significant (\~{}3 {$\sigma$}) detection of a trend for colors to become redder by 0.1-0.14 (0.03-0.06) mag with a factor of \~{}100 increase in local density, as characterized by the surface density of galaxies within a +/-1000 km s$^{-1}$ redshift slice. In contrast, at fixed luminosity the fraction of galaxies in the red distribution is a strong function of local density, increasing from \~{}10\%-30\% of the population in the lowest density environments to \~{}70\% at the highest densities. The strength of this trend is similar for both the brightest (-23$\lt$M$_{r}$$\lt$-22) and faintest (-19$\lt$M$_{r}$$\lt$-18) galaxies in our sample. The fraction of red galaxies within the virialized regions of clusters shows no significant dependence on velocity dispersion. Even at the lowest densities explored, a substantial population of red galaxies exists, which might be fossil groups. We propose that most star-forming galaxies today evolve at a rate that is determined primarily by their intrinsic properties and independent of their environment. Any environmentally triggered transformations from blue to red colors must occur either on a short timescale or preferentially at high redshift to preserve the simple Gaussian nature of the color distribution. The mechanism must be effective for both bright and faint galaxies.},

The five unique NIR filters of the NMBS enable the precise measurement of photometric redshifts and rest-frame colors for 9900 galaxies at 1 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2.5. The rest-frame U - V color distribution at all z lsim 2.5 is bimodal, with a red peak, a blue peak, and a population of galaxies in between (the green valley). Model fits to the optical-NIR spectral energy distributions and the distribution of MIPS-detected galaxies indicate that the colors of galaxies in the green valley are determined largely by the amount of reddening by dust. This result does not support the simplest interpretation of green valley objects as a transition from blue star forming to red quiescent galaxies. We show that correcting the rest-frame colors for dust reddening allows a remarkably clean separation between the red and blue sequences up to z \~{} 2.5. Our study confirms that dusty-starburst galaxies can contribute a significant fraction to red-sequence samples selected on the basis of a single rest-frame color (i.e., U - V), so extra care must be taken if samples of truly ``red and dead'' galaxies are desired. Interestingly, of galaxies detected at 24 {$\mu$}m, 14\% remain on the red sequence after applying the reddening correction.},

  abstract      = {This is the first in a series of papers examining the demographics of star-forming galaxies at $0.2\ltz\lt2.5$ in CANDELS. We study 9,100 galaxies from GOODS-S and UDS having published values of redshifts, masses, star-formation rates (SFRs), and dust attenuation ($A\_V$) derived from UV-optical SED fitting. In agreement with previous works, we find that the $UVJ$ colors of a galaxy are closely correlated with its specific star-formation rate (SSFR) and $A\_V$. We define rotated $UVJ$ coordinate axes, termed $S\_\mathrm{SED}$ and $C\_\mathrm{SED}$, that are parallel and perpendicular to the star-forming sequence and derive a quantitative calibration that predicts SSFR from $C\_\mathrm{SED}$ with an accuracy of \~{}0.2 dex. SFRs from UV-optical fitting and from UV+IR values based on Spitzer/MIPS 24 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ agree well overall, but systematic differences of order 0.2 dex exist at high and low redshifts. A novel plotting scheme conveys the evolution of multiple galaxy properties simultaneously, and dust growth, as well as star-formation decline and quenching, exhibit ``mass-accelerated evolution'' (``downsizing''). A population of transition galaxies below the star-forming main sequence is identified. These objects are located between star-forming and quiescent galaxies in $UVJ$ space and have lower $A\_V$ and smaller radii than galaxies on the main sequence. Their properties are consistent with their being in transit between the two regions. The relative numbers of quenched, transition, and star-forming galaxies are given as a function of mass and redshift.},

We show that star-forming galaxies at high redshift ( z > 1.5) are consistent with a model in which the interstellar medium conditions are more extreme at high redshift than seen in the global spectra of local galaxies. We speculate that global spectra of our high-redshift galaxies may be dominated by H II regions similar to the extreme clumpy, dense star-forming complexes in the Antennae and M82. The transition to local-type conditions occurs between 0.8 < z < 1.5. We conclude that classification schemes developed for local samples should not be applied at high redshift ( z ≥ 1.5). We use our theoretical models to derive a new redshift-dependent classification line that utilizes the standard optical diagnostic line ratios [O III ]/Hβ and [N II ]/Hα. Our new line can be used to separate star-forming galaxies from active galactic nuclei (AGN) between z = 0 to z ~ 3.5. We anticipate that our redshift-dependent optical classification line will be useful for future large surveys with near-infrared multi-object spectrographs. We apply our classification line to a sample of gravitationally lensed galaxies at z ~ 2.5. Although limited by small numbers, we show that our classification line is consistent with the position of AGN that have been independently confirmed via other methods.},

The slopes can be reproduced by a single model sequence in which all elliptical galaxies are assumed to be equally old (the maximum age difference allowed for the brightest 3 magnitudes is only 1 Gyr) and to have mean stellar metallicities which vary as a function of galaxy luminosity. The zero-points of the colour-magnitude relations constrain the epoch of major star formation in early-type galaxies to z\_f$\gt$2-4. This study provides two important constraints for any model of the formation of rich clusters: the uniformity of the ages of the stellar populations in the early-type galaxies and the universality of the metallicity sequence of these galaxies as a function of galaxy mass.},

In this Letter, we have measured the rest-frame NUV − B color gradients in ∼1400 large ( r e > 0.″18), nearly face-on ( b / a > 0.5) main sequence star-forming galaxies (SFGs) between redshift 0.5 and 1.5 in the CANDELS/GOODS-S and UDS fields. With this sample, we study the origin of UV–optical color gradients in the SFGs at z ∼ 1 and discuss their link with the buildup of stellar mass. We find that the more massive, centrally compact, and more dust extinguished SFGs tend to have statistically more negative raw color gradients (redder centers) than the less massive, centrally diffuse, and less dusty SFGs. After correcting for dust reddening based on optical-spectral energy distribution fitting, the color gradients in the low-mass ( M * < 10 10 M ⊙ ) SFGs generally become quite flat, while most of the high-mass ( M * > 10 10.5 M ⊙ ) SFGs still retain shallow negative color gradients. These findings imply that dust reddening is likely the principal cause of negative color gradients in the low-mass SFGs, while both increased central dust reddening and buildup of compact old bulges are likely the origins of negative color gradients in the high-mass SFGs. These findings also imply that at these redshifts the low-mass SFGs buildup their stellar masses in a self-similar way, while the high-mass SFGs grow inside out.},

The use of the UVJ diagram as a tool to distinguish quiescent galaxies from star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is becoming more common due to its ability to separate red quiescent galaxies from reddened SFGs. Quiescent galaxies occupy a small and distinct region of UVJ color space and we find most of them to have concentrated profiles with high Sérsic indices ( n > 2.5) and smooth structure characteristic of early-type systems. SFGs populate a broad but well-defined sequence of UVJ colors and are comprised of objects with a mix of Sérsic indices. Interestingly, most UVJ -selected SFGs with high Sérsic indices also display structure due to dust and star formation typical of the n < 2.5 SFGs and late-type systems. Finally, we find that the position of an SFG on the sequence of UVJ colors is determined to a large degree by the mass of the galaxy and its inclination. Systems that are closer to edge-on generally display redder colors and lower [O II ]λ3727 luminosity per unit mass as a consequence of the reddening due to dust within the disks. We conclude that the two main features seen in UVJ color space correspond closely to the traditional morphological classes of early- and late-type galaxies.},

  abstract      = {This paper uses radial colour profiles to infer the distributions of dust, gas and star formation in z = 0.4-1.4 star-forming main-sequence galaxies. We start with the standard UVJ-based method to estimate dust extinction and specific star formation rate (sSFR). By replacing J with I band, a new calibration method suitable for use with ACS+WFC3 data is created (I.e. UVI diagram). Using a multi-wavelength multi-aperture photometry catalogue based on CANDELS (Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey), UVI colour profiles of 1328 galaxies are stacked in stellar mass and redshift bins. The resulting colour gradients, covering a radial range of 0.2-2.0 effective radii, increase strongly with galaxy mass and with global A$_{V}$. Colour gradient directions are nearly parallel to the Calzetti extinction vector, indicating that dust plays a more important role than stellar population variations. With our calibration, the resulting A$_{V}$ profiles fall much more slowly than stellar mass profiles over the measured radial range. sSFR gradients are nearly flat without central quenching signatures, except for M$_{⋆}$ $\gt$ 10$^{10.5}$ M$_{⊙}$, where central declines of 20-25 per cent are observed. Both sets of profiles agree well with previous radial sSFR and (continuum) A$_{V}$ measurements. They are also consistent with the sSFR profiles and, if assuming a radially constant gas-to-dust ratio, gas profiles in recent hydrodynamic models. We finally discuss the striking findings that SFR scales with stellar mass density in the inner parts of galaxies, and that dust content is high in the outer parts despite low stellar mass surface densities there.},

Approximately 95% and 90% of all IRAC sources are detected in the deepest optical and near-infrared bands. These fractions are reduced to 85% and 70% for S/N > 5 detections in each band.

  abstract = {We use a large sample of galaxies from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to calculate galaxy luminosity and stellar mass functions in the local universe. We estimate corrections for passband shifting and galaxy evolution, as well as present-day stellar mass-to-light ( M / L ) ratios, by fitting the optical-near-infrared galaxy data with simple models. Accounting for the 8% galaxy overdensity in the SDSS early data release region, the optical and near-infrared luminosity functions we construct for this sample agree with most recent literature optical and near-infrared determinations within the uncertainties. We argue that 2MASS is biased against low surface brightness galaxies and use SDSS plus our knowledge of stellar populations to estimate the "true" K -band luminosity function. This has a steeper faint end slope and a slightly higher overall luminosity density than the direct estimate. Furthermore, assuming a universally applicable stellar initial mass function (IMF), we find good agreement between the stellar mass function we derive from the 2MASS/SDSS data and that derived by Cole et al. The faint end slope for the stellar mass function is steeper than -1.1, reflecting the low stellar M / L ratios characteristic of low-mass galaxies. We estimate an upper limit to the stellar mass density in the local universe Ω * h = 2.0 ± 0.6 × 10 -3 by assuming an IMF as rich in low-mass stars as allowed by observations of galaxy dynamics in the local universe. The stellar mass density may be lower than this value if a different IMF with fewer low-mass stars is assumed. Finally, we examine type-dependence in the optical and near-infrared luminosity functions and the stellar mass function. In agreement with previous work, we find that the characteristic luminosity or mass of early-type galaxies is larger than for later types, and the faint end slope is steeper for later types than for earlier types. Accounting for typing uncertainties, we estimate that at least half, and perhaps as much as 3/4, of the stellar mass in the universe is in early-type galaxies. As an aid to workers in the field, we present in an Appendix the relationship between model stellar M / L ratios and colors in SDSS/2MASS passbands, an updated discussion of near-infrared stellar M / L ratio estimates, and the volume-corrected distribution of g - and K -band stellar M / L ratios as a function of stellar mass.},

  abstract = {The mid-infrared local luminosity function is evolved with redshift to fit the spectrum of the cosmic infrared background (CIRB) at λ > 5 μm and the galaxy counts from various surveys at mid-infrared, far-infrared, and submillimeter wavelengths. A variety of evolutionary models provide satisfactory fits to the CIRB and the number counts. The degeneracy in the range of models cannot be broken by current observations. However, the different evolutionary models yield approximately the same comoving number density of infrared luminous galaxies as a function of redshift. Since the spectrum of the cosmic background at λ > 200 μm is quite sensitive to the evolution at high redshift, i.e., z > 1, all models that fit the counts require a flattening at z ~ 0.8 to avoid overproducing the CIRB. About 80% of the 140 μm CIRB is produced at 0 < z < 1.5, while only about 30% of the 850 μm background is produced within the same redshift range. The nature of the evolution is then translated into a measure of the dust-enshrouded star formation rate (SFR) density as a function of redshift and compared with estimates from rest-frame optical/ultraviolet surveys. The dust-enshrouded SFR density appears to peak at z = 0.8 ± 0.1, much sooner than previously thought, with a value of 0.25 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/556/2/562/img1.gif] {img1.gif} M ☉ yr -1 Mpc -3 , and remains almost constant up to z ~ 2. At least 70% of this star formation takes place in infrared luminous galaxies with L IR > 10 11 L ☉ . The long-wavelength observations that constrain our evolutionary models do not strongly trace the evolution at z > 2 and a drop-off in the dust-enshrouded SFR density is consistent with both the CIRB spectrum and the number counts. However, a comparison with the infrared luminosity function derived from extinction-corrected rest-frame optical/ultraviolet observations of the Lyman break galaxy population at z ~ 3 suggests that the almost flat comoving SFR density seen between redshifts of 0.8 and 2 extends up to a redshift of z ~ 4.},

Dwarf irregular galaxies are notable exceptions, as already noted by other authors, as their 500 μm emission shows evidence for a submillimeter excess. In addition, the fraction of dust heating attributed to intense radiation fields associated with photodissociation regions is found to be (21 ± 4)% larger when Herschel data are included in the analysis. Dust masses obtained from the dust emission models of Draine & Li are found to be on average nearly a factor of two higher than those based on single-temperature modified blackbodies, as single blackbody curves do not capture the full range of dust temperatures inherent to any galaxy. The discrepancy is largest for galaxies exhibiting the coolest far-infrared colors.},

  abstract = {New far-infrared and submillimeter data are used to solidify and to extend to long wavelengths the empirical calibration of the infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) of normal star-forming galaxies. As was found by Dale and coworkers in 2001, a single parameter family, characterized by f ν (60 μm)/ f ν (100 μm), is adequate to describe the range of normal galaxy SEDs observed by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite and Infrared Space Observatory from 3 to 100 μm. However, predictions based on the first-generation models at longer wavelengths (122-850 μm) are increasingly overluminous compared to the data for smaller f ν (60 μm)/ f ν (100 μm), or alternatively, for weaker global interstellar radiation fields. After slightly modifying the far-infrared/submillimeter dust emissivity in those models as a function of the radiation field intensity to better match the long-wavelength data, a suite of SEDs from 3 μm to 20 cm in wavelength is presented. Results from relevant applications are also discussed, including submillimeter-based photometric redshift indicators, the infrared energy budget and simple formulae for recovering the bolometric infrared luminosity, and dust mass estimates in galaxies. Regarding the latter, since galaxy infrared SEDs are not well described by single blackbody curves, the usual methods of estimating dust masses can be grossly inadequate. The improved model presented herein is used to provide a more accurate relation between infrared luminosity and dust mass.},

Updated IR absorption properties for the PAHs are presented that are consistent with observed emission spectra, including those newly obtained by Spitzer . We find a size distribution for the PAHs giving emission band ratios consistent with the observed spectra of the Milky Way and other galaxies. Emission spectra are presented for a wide range of starlight intensities. We calculate how the efficiency of emission into different IR bands depends on PAH size; the strong 7.7 μm emission feature is produced mainly by PAH particles containing <10 3 C atoms. We also calculate how the emission spectrum depends on U , the starlight intensity relative to the local interstellar radiation field. The submillimeter and far-infrared emission is compared to the observed emission from the local interstellar medium. Using a simple distribution function, we calculate the emission spectrum for dust heated by a distribution of starlight intensities, such as occurs within galaxies. The models are parameterized by the PAH mass fraction q PAH , the lower cutoff U min of the starlight intensity distribution, and the fraction γ of the dust heated by starlight with U > U min . We present graphical procedures using Spitzer IRAC and MIPS photometry to estimate the parameters q PAH , U min , and γ, the fraction f PDR of the dust luminosity coming from photodissociation regions with U > 100, and the total dust mass M dust .},

  abstract = {One of the major challenges to identification of the 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 {$\mu$}m interstellar infrared (IR) emission bands with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules has been the recent detection of these bands in regions with little ultraviolet (UV) illumination, since small, neutral PAH molecules have little or no absorption at visible wavelengths and therefore require UV photons for excitation. We show here that our ``astronomical'' PAH model, incorporating the experimental result that the visual absorption edge shifts to longer wavelength upon ionization and/or as the PAH size increases, can closely reproduce the observed IR emission bands of vdB 133, a UV-poor reflection nebula. We also show that single-photon heating of ``astronomical'' PAHs in reflection nebulae near stars as cool as T$_{eff}$=3000K can result in observable emission at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 {$\mu$}m. Illustrative mid-IR emission spectra are calculated for reflection nebulae illuminated by cool stars with T$_{eff}$=3500, 4500, and 5000 K. These will allow comparison with future Space Infrared Telescope Facility observations of vdB 135 (T$_{eff}$=3600K), vdB 47 (T$_{eff}$=4500K), and vdB 101 (T$_{eff}$=5000K). The dependence on the effective temperature of the exciting star of the observed 12 {$\mu$}m IRAS emission (relative to the total far-IR emission) is consistent with the PAH model for 3000K$\lt$=T$_{eff}$$\lt$=30,000K.},

  abstract      = {A randomly chosen star in today's Universe is most likely to live in a galaxy with a stellar mass between that of the Milky Way and Andromeda. Yet it remains uncertain how the structural evolution of these bulge-disk systems proceeded. Most of the unobscured star formation we observe building Andromdeda progenitors at 0.7$\lt$z$\lt$1.5 occurs in disks, but $\gt$90\% of their star formation is reprocessed by dust and remains unaccounted for. Here we map 500micron dust continuum emission in an Andromeda progenitor at z=1.25 to probe where it is growing through dust-obscured star formation. Combining resolved dust measurements from the NOEMA interferometer with Hubble Space Telescope Halpha maps and multicolor imaging (including new UV data from the HDUV survey), we find a bulge growing by dust-obscured star formation: while the unobscured star formation is centrally suppressed, the dust continuum is centrally concentrated, filling in the ring-like structures evident in the Halpha and UV emission. Reflecting this, the dust emission is more compact than the optical/UV tracers of star formation with r\_e(dust)=3.4kpc, r\_e(Halpha)/r\_e(dust)=1.4, and r\_e(UV)/r\_e(dust)=1.8. Crucially, however, the bulge and disk of this galaxy are building simultaneously; although the dust emission is more compact than the rest-optical emission (r\_e(optical)/r\_e(dust)=1.4), it is somewhat less compact than the stellar mass (r\_e(M\_*)/r\_e(dust)=0.9). Taking the 500micron emission as a tracer of star formation, the expected structural evolution of this galaxy can be accounted for by star formation: it will grow in size by Delta(r\_e)/Delta(M\_*)\~{}0.3 and central surface density by Delta(Sigma\_cen)/Delta(M\_*)\~{}0.9. Finally, our observations are consistent with a picture in which merging and disk instabilities drive gas to the center of galaxies, boosting global star formation rates above the main sequence and building bulges.},

MIPS 24 μm photometry can yield SFRs accurately from this luminosity upward: SFR( M ☉ yr –1 ) = 7.8 × 10 –10 L (24 μm, L ☉ ) from L (TIR) = 5× 10 9 L ☉ to 10 11 L ☉ and SFR = 7.8 × 10 –10 L (24 μm, L ☉ )(7.76 × 10 –11 L (24)) 0.048 for higher L (TIR). For galaxies with L (TIR) ≥ 10 10 L ☉ , these new expressions should provide SFRs to within 0.2 dex. For L (TIR) ≥ 10 11 L ☉ , we find that the SFR of infrared galaxies is significantly underestimated using extinction-corrected Paα (and presumably using any other optical or near-infrared recombination lines). As a part of this work, we constructed spectral energy distribution templates for eleven luminous and ultraluminous purely star forming infrared galaxies and over the spectral range 0.4 μm to 30 cm. We use these templates and the SINGS data to construct average templates from 5 μm to 30 cm for infrared galaxies with L (TIR) = 5× 10 9 to 10 13 L ☉ .

  abstract      = {(abridged) In the hunt for rare time-domain events, confusing exotic extragalactic phenomena with more common Galactic foreground events is an important consideration. We show how observations from multiple wavebands, in this case optical and X-ray observations, can be used to facilitate the distinction between the two. We discovered an extremely bright and rapid transient event in optical observations of M31 with the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF). The persistent optical counterpart of this transient was previously thought to be a variable star in M31 without any dramatic flux excursions. The iPTF event initially appeared to be an extraordinarily rapid and energetic extragalactic transient, a very fast nova in M31 being one of the exciting possibilities, with a \~{}3mag positive flux excursion in less than a kilosecond. The nature of the source was resolved with the help of Chandra archival data, where we found an X-ray counterpart and obtained its X-ray spectrum. We find the X-ray spectrum of the quiescent emission can be described by a model of optically thin plasma emission with a temperature of \~{}7MK, typical for coronal emission from an active star. The combination of the X-ray luminosity, calculated assuming the source is located in M31 (\~{}3.10\^{}36 erg/s), and the color temperature exclude any type of known accreting compact object or active star in M31. We argue instead that the optical transient source is an M type main-sequence, active star located in the disk of the Milky Way at a distance of \~{}0.5-1 kpc. Its persistent X-ray luminosity is in the \~{}(1.3-5).10\^{}30 erg/s range and it has the absolute optical magnitude of 9.5-11.0 mag in R-band. The observed optical flare has the equivalent duration of \~{}95min and total energy of \~{}(0.3-1).10\^{}35 erg in R-band, which places it among the brightest flares ever observed from an M-type star.},

  abstract = { CO line emission represents the most accessible and widely used tracer of the molecular ISM. This renders the translation of observed CO intensity into total H2 gas mass critical to understanding star formation and the ISM in our Galaxy and beyond. We review the theoretical underpinning, techniques, and results of efforts to estimate this CO-to-H2 “conversion factor,” XCO, in different environments. In the Milky Way disk, we recommend a conversion factor of cm−2 (K km s−1)−1 with ±30\% uncertainty. Studies of other “normal galaxies” return similar values in Milky Way–like disks, but with greater scatter and systematic uncertainty. Departures from this Galactic conversion factor are both observed and expected. Dust-based determinations, theoretical arguments, and scaling relations all suggest that XCO increases with decreasing metallicity, turning up sharply below metallicity ∼1/3–1/2 solar in a manner consistent with model predictions that identify shielding as a key parameter. Based on spectral line modeling and dust observations, XCO appears to drop in the central, bright regions of some but not all galaxies, often coincident with regions of bright CO emission and high stellar surface density. This lower XCO is also present in the overwhelmingly molecular ISM of starburst galaxies, where several lines of evidence point to a lower CO-to-H2 conversion factor. At high redshift, direct evidence regarding the conversion factor remains scarce; we review what is known based on dynamical modeling and other arguments. },

The 190-305 GHz observation band corresponds to the rest frame 272-444 μm, and we measure the dust continuum as well as all four transitions of carbon monoxide (CO) lying in this range. The power-law dust emission, F ν = 14 mJy(ν/240 GHz) 3.9 is consistent with the published continuum measurements. The CO J = 6 → 5, J = 8 → 7, and J = 9 → 8 measurements are the first, and now provide the highest- J CO information in this source. Our measured CO intensities are very close to the previously published interferometric measurements of J = 7 → 6, and we use all available transitions and our 13 CO upper limits to constrain the physical conditions in the Cloverleaf molecular gas disk. We find a large mass (2-50 × 10 9 M ☉ ) of highly excited gas with thermal pressure nT > 10 6 K cm –3 . The ratio of the total CO cooling to the far-IR dust emission exceeds that in the local dusty galaxies, and we investigate the potential heating sources for this bulk of warm molecular gas. We conclude that both UV photons and X-rays likely contribute, and discuss implications for a top-heavy stellar initial mass function arising in the X-ray-irradiated starburst. Finally, we present tentative identifications of other species in the spectrum, including a possible detection of the H 2 O \2 0,2 → 1 1,1 transition at λ rest = 303 μm.},

  abstract = { Over the past decade, observations of the cool interstellar medium (ISM) in distant galaxies via molecular and atomic fine structure line (FSL) emission have gone from a curious look into a few extreme, rare objects to a mainstream tool for studying galaxy formation out to the highest redshifts. Molecular gas has been observed in close to 200 galaxies at z > 1, including numerous AGN host-galaxies out to z ∼ 7, highly star-forming submillimeter galaxies, and increasing samples of main-sequence color-selected star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 1.5 to 2.5. Studies have moved well beyond simple detections to dynamical imaging at kiloparsec-scale resolution and multiline, multispecies studies that determine the physical conditions in the ISM in early galaxies. Observations of the cool gas are the required complement to studies of the stellar density and star-formation history of the Universe as they reveal the phase of the ISM that immediately precedes star formation in galaxies. Current observations suggest that the order of magnitude increase in the cosmic star-formation rate density from z ∼ 0 to 2 is commensurate with a similar increase in the gas-to-stellar mass ratio in star-forming disk galaxies. Progress has been made in determining the CO luminosity to H2 mass conversion factor at high z, and the dichotomy between high versus low values for main-sequence versus starburst galaxies, respectively, appears to persist with increasing redshift, with a likely dependence on metallicity and other local physical conditions. There may also be two sequences in the relationship between star-formation rate and gas mass: one for starbursts, in which the gas consumption timescale is short (a few 107 years), and one for main sequence galaxies, with an order of magnitude longer gas consumption timescale. Studies of atomic FSL emission are rapidly progressing, with some tens of galaxies detected in the exceptionally bright [Cii] 158-μm line to date. The [Cii] line is proving to be a unique tracer of galaxy dynamics in the early Universe and, together with other atomic FSLs, has the potential to be the most direct means of obtaining spectroscopic redshifts for the first galaxies during cosmic reionization. },

We extend our sample to high redshifts ( z > 1) by including 35 submillimeter selected dusty star forming galaxies from the literature with robust CO observations, and sufficiently well-sampled FIR/submillimeter spectral energy distributions (SEDs), so that accurate FIR luminosities can be determined. The addition of luminous starbursts at high redshifts enlarge the range of the FIR–CO luminosity relations toward the high-IR-luminosity end, while also significantly increasing the small amount of mid- J /high- J CO line data ( J = 5-4 and higher) that was available prior to Herschel . This new data set (both in terms of IR luminosity and J -ladder) reveals linear FIR–CO luminosity relations (i.e., α ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sime.gif] {sime} 1) for J = 1-0 up to J = 5-4, with a nearly constant normalization (β ~ 2). In the simplest physical scenario, this is expected from the (also) linear FIR–(molecular line) relations recently found for the dense gas tracer lines (HCN and CS), as long as the dense gas mass fraction does not vary strongly within our (merger/starburst)-dominated sample. However, from J = 6-5 and up to the J = 13-12 transition, we find an increasingly sublinear slope and higher normalization constant with increasing J . We argue that these are caused by a warm (~100 K) and dense (>10 4 cm –3 ) gas component whose thermal state is unlikely to be maintained by star-formation-powered far-UV radiation fields (and thus is no longer directly tied to the star formation rate). We suggest that mechanical heating (e.g., supernova-driven turbulence and shocks), and not cosmic rays, is the more likely source of energy for this component. The global CO spectral line energy distributions, which remain highly excited from J = 6-5 up to J = 13-12, are found to be a generic feature of the (U)LIRGs in our sample, and further support the presence of this gas component.},

The mid- to high- J CO luminosity relative to CO J = 1−0 increases with increasing L FIR , indicating higher excitement of the molecular gas, although these ratios do not exceed ∼180.

A single component theoretical photodissociation region (PDR) model cannot match these flat SLED shapes, although combinations of PDR models with mechanical heating added qualitatively match the shapes, indicating the need for further comprehensive modeling of the excitation processes of warm molecular gas in nearby galaxies.},

We also derive an average CO spectral line energy distribution for the entire sample and discuss the implied average molecular gas properties for these local galaxies. We further extend our sample to high- z galaxies with CO( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/810/2/L14/apjl518642ieqn10.gif] {$J=5-4$} ) data from the literature as an example, including submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) and “normal” star-forming BzKs. BzKs have similar FIR/CO(5–4) ratios as those of local galaxies, and agreeably follow the locally-determined correlation, whereas SMG ratios fall around or slightly above the local correlation with large uncertainties.

  abstract = {We present ~kiloparsec spatial resolution maps of the CO-to-H 2 conversion factor (α CO ) and dust-to-gas ratio (DGR) in 26 nearby, star-forming galaxies. We have simultaneously solved for α CO and the DGR by assuming that the DGR is approximately constant on kiloparsec scales. With this assumption, we can combine maps of dust mass surface density, CO-integrated intensity, and H I column density to solve for both α CO and the DGR with no assumptions about their value or dependence on metallicity or other parameters. Such a study has just become possible with the availability of high-resolution far-IR maps from the Herschel key program KINGFISH, 12CO J = (2-1) maps from the IRAM 30 m large program HERACLES, and H I 21 cm line maps from THINGS. We use a fixed ratio between the (2-1) and (1-0) lines to present our α CO results on the more typically used 12 CO J = (1-0) scale and show using literature measurements that variations in the line ratio do not affect our results. In total, we derive 782 individual solutions for α CO and the DGR. On average, α CO = 3.1 M ☉ pc –2 (K km s –1 ) –1 for our sample with a standard deviation of 0.3 dex. Within galaxies, we observe a generally flat profile of α CO as a function of galactocentric radius. However, most galaxies exhibit a lower α CO value in the central kiloparsec—a factor of ~2 below the galaxy mean, on average. In some cases, the central α CO value can be factors of 5-10 below the standard Milky Way (MW) value of α CO, MW = 4.4 M ☉ pc –2 (K km s –1 ) –1 . While for α CO we find only weak correlations with metallicity, the DGR is well-correlated with metallicity, with an approximately linear slope. Finally, we present several recommendations for choosing an appropriate α CO for studies of nearby galaxies.},

Photoionization models predict a break in the radial profiles of HI at a column density of 5x10E+19 cm\^{}-2 due to the lack of self-shielding against extragalactic ionizing photons. To investigate the prevalence of such breaks in galactic disks and to characterize what determines the potential ``edge'' of the HI disks, we study the azimuthally-averaged HI column density profiles of 17 nearby galaxies from The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS) and supplemented in two cases with published Hydrogen Accretion in LOcal GAlaxieS (HALOGAS) data. To detect potential faint HI emission that would otherwise be undetected using conventional moment map analysis, we line up individual profiles to the same reference velocity and average them azimuthally to derive stacked radial profiles. To do so, we use model velocity fields created from a simple extrapolation of the rotation curves to align the profiles in velocity at radii beyond the extent probed with the sensitivity of traditional integrated HI maps. With this method, we improve our sensitivity to outer-disk HI emission by up to an order of magnitude. Except for a few disturbed galaxies, none show evidence for a sudden change in the slope of the HI radial profiles, the alleged signature of ionization by the extragalactic background.},

The primary goal of this project is to observe spectroscopy of star formation regions in 20 nearby galaxies, with the NAOC 2.16 m telescope and the Hectospec/MMT multifiber spectrograph. With the spectra of a large sample of star formation regions, combining multi-wavelength data from UV to IR, we can investigate, understand and quantify the dust extinction, star formation rate, metal abundance, and the two-dimensional distributions of stellar population properties of nearby galaxies.

  abstract    = {The objectives of this paper are to analyse molecular gas properties of the first substantial sample of GRB hosts and test whether they are deficient in molecular gas. We obtained CO(2-1) observations of seven GRB hosts with the APEX and IRAM30m telescopes. We analyse these data together with all other hosts with previous CO observations. We obtained detections for three GRB hosts (980425, 080207 and 111005A) and upper limits for the remaining four (031203, 060505, 060814, 100316D). In our entire sample of twelve CO-observed GRB hosts, three are clearly deficient in molecular gas, even taking into account their metallicity (980425, 060814, and 080517). Four others are close to the best fit-line for other star-forming galaxies on the SFR-MH2 plot (051022, 060505, 080207, and 100316D). One host is clearly molecule-rich (111005A). Finally, for four GRB hosts the data is not deep enough to judge whether they are molecule-deficient (000418, 030329, 031203, 090423). The median value of the molecular gas depletion time, MH2/SFR, of GRB hosts is ~0.3 dex below that of other star-forming galaxies, but this result has low statistical significance. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test performed on MH2/SFR shows only ~2 sigma difference between GRB hosts and other galaxies. This difference can partially be explained by metallicity effects, since the significance decreases to ~1 sigma for MH2/SFR vs. metallicity. Thus the sample of GRB hosts has consistent molecular properties to other galaxies, and can be treated as representative star-forming galaxies. Given the concentration of atomic gas recently found close to GRB and supernova sites, indicating recent gas inflow, our results imply that such inflow does not enhance the SFRs significantly, or that atomic gas converts efficiently into the molecular phase.},

We identify two primary causes of halo mass loss: relaxation after a major merger and tidal stripping by a massive neighbouring halo. Major mergers initially boost $M\_{\mathrm{vir}}$ and typically cause the final halo to become more prolate and less relaxed and to have higher spin and lower NFW concentration. As the halo relaxes, high energy material from the recent merger gradually escapes beyond the virial radius, temporarily resulting in a net negative accretion rate that reduces the halo mass by $5-15\\%$ on average. Halos that experience a major merger around $z = 0.4$ typically reach a minimum mass near $z = 0$. Tidal stripping mainly occurs in dense regions, and it causes halos to become less prolate and have lower spins and higher NFW concentrations. Tidally stripped halos often lose a large fraction of their peak mass ($\gt 20\\%$) and most never recover (or even reattain a positive accretion rate). Low mass halos can be strongly affected by both post-merger mass loss and tidal stripping, while high mass halos are predominantly influenced by post-merger mass loss and show few signs of significant tidal stripping.},

We map dark matter halo mass to galaxy stellar mass using relationships from abundance matching, applied to the Bolshoi-Planck dissipationless N-body simulation. We define SRHR$\equiv r\_e/R\_h$ as the ratio of galaxy radius to halo virial radius, and SRHR$\lambda \equiv r\_e/(\lambda R\_h)$ as the ratio of galaxy radius to halo spin parameter times halo radius. At $z\sim 0.1$, we find an average value of SRHR $\simeq 0.018$ and SRHR$\lambda \simeq 0.5$ with very little dependence on stellar mass. SRHR and SRHR$\lambda$ have a weak dependence on cosmic time since $z\sim 3$. SRHR shows a mild decrease over cosmic time for low mass galaxies, but increases slightly or does not evolve for more massive galaxies. We find hints that at high redshift ($z\sim 2$--3), SRHR$\lambda$ is lower for more massive galaxies, while it shows no significant dependence on stellar mass at $z\lesssim 0.5$. We find that for both the GAMA and CANDELS samples, at all redshifts from $z\sim 0.1$--3, the observed conditional size distribution in stellar mass bins is remarkably similar to the conditional distribution of $\lambda R\_h$.

We use high-resolution cosmological simulations from the Feedback in Realistic Environment (FIRE) project to analyze the dust emission of $M\_*\gt10^{10}\;M\_{\odot}$ galaxies at $z=2-4$. Our simulations (MassiveFIRE) explicitly include various forms of stellar feedback, and they produce the stellar masses and star formation rates of high-$z$ galaxies in agreement with observations. Using radiative transfer modelling, we show that sub-millimeter (sub-mm) luminosity and molecular ISM mass are tightly correlated and that the overall normalization is in quantitative agreement with observations. Notably, sub-mm luminosity traces molecular ISM mass even during starburst episodes as dust mass and mass-weighted temperature evolve only moderately between $z=4$ and $z=2$, including during starbursts. Our finding supports the empirical approach of using broadband sub-mm flux as a proxy for molecular gas content in high-$z$ galaxies. We thus expect single-band sub-mm observations with ALMA to dramatically increase the sample size of high-$z$ galaxies with reliable ISM masses in the near future.},

However, at both lower and higher redshifts (and around galaxies) much is still unknown about the IGM.

  title       = {Measuring the circum- and inter-galactic baryon contents with fast radio bursts},
  abstract    = {Over 80% of the cosmic baryon density is likely to be distributed in the diffuse, $\gtrsim10^{4}$ K circum- and inter-galactic medium (CGM and IGM respectively). We demonstrate that the dispersion measures (DMs) of samples of localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) can be used to measure the distribution of baryons between the CGM and IGM. We propose to separate the CGM and IGM contributions to FRB DMs by including redshift and mass measurements of intervening galaxies. Using simulated samples of FRB sightlines through intervening galaxy halos and an illustrative model for the CGM, and including realistic observational uncertainties, we show that small samples ($O(10^{1})-O(10^{2})$) of localized FRBs are sensitive to the presence of CGM gas. The fractions of baryons in the CGM and IGM can be accurately estimated with 100 FRBs at $z<1$, and the characteristic radial density profiles of CGM halos may also be possible to constrain. The required samples of localized FRBs are expected to be assembled in the coming few years by instruments such as the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, the Very Large Array, and the Deep Synoptic Array.},

This review surveys the observed mid-IR characteristics of these emission features and summarizes laboratory and theoretical studies of the spectral characteristics of PAHs and the derived intrinsic properties of emitting interstellar PAHs. Dedicated experimental studies have provided critical input for detailed astronomical models that probe the origin and evolution of interstellar PAHs and their role in the universe. The physics and chemistry of PAHs are discussed, emphasizing the contribution of these species to the photoelectric heating and the ionization balance of the interstellar gas and to the formation of small hydrocarbon radicals and carbon chains. Together, these studies demonstrate that PAHs are abundant, ubiquitous, and a dominant force in the interstellar medium of galaxies. },

The mass-metallicity relation exhibits the smallest intrinsic scatter at the galaxies' times of peak stellar mass, suggesting stellar mass stripping to be the primary effect responsible for the rather broad relation at present. However, for about 40% of galaxies in the high-metallicity tail of the relation, we find mass stripping to coincide with an increased enrichment of stellar metallicity, possibly caused by the stripping of low-metallicity stars in the galaxy outskirts.},

  abstract      = {We present the stellar mass ($M\_{*}$)--gas-phase metallicity relation (MZR) and its scatter at intermediate redshifts ($0.5\leq z\leq0.7$) for 1381 field galaxies collected from deep spectroscopic surveys. The star formation rate (SFR) and color at a given $M\_{*}$ of this magnitude-limited ($R\lesssim24$ AB) sample are representative of normal star-forming galaxies. For masses below $10^9 M\_\odot$, our sample of 237 galaxies is $\sim$10 times larger than those in previous studies beyond the local universe. This huge gain in sample size enables superior constraints on the MZR and its scatter in the low-mass regime. We find a power-law MZR at $10^{8} M\_\odot \lt M\_{*} \lt 10^{11} M\_\odot$: ${12+log(O/H) = (5.83\pm0.19) + (0.30\pm0.02)log(M\_{*}/M\_\odot)}$. Our MZR shows good agreement with others measured at similar redshifts in the literature in the intermediate and massive regimes, but is shallower than the extrapolation of the MZRs of others to masses below $10^{9} M\_\odot$. The SFR dependence of the MZR in our sample is weaker than that found for local galaxies (known as the Fundamental Metallicity Relation). Compared to a variety of theoretical models, the slope of our MZR for low-mass galaxies agrees well with predictions incorporating supernova energy-driven winds. Being robust against currently uncertain metallicity calibrations, the scatter of the MZR serves as a powerful diagnostic of the stochastic history of gas accretion, gas recycling, and star formation of low-mass galaxies. Our major result is that the scatter of our MZR increases as $M\_{*}$ decreases. Our result implies that either the scatter of the baryonic accretion rate or the scatter of the $M\_{*}$--$M\_{halo}$ relation increases as $M\_{*}$ decreases. Moreover, our measures of scatter at $z=0.7$ appears consistent with that found for local galaxies.},

  abstract      = {In a $\Lambda$CDM Universe, the specific stellar angular momentum ($j\_\ast$) and stellar mass ($M\_\ast$) of a galaxy are correlated as a consequence of the scaling existing for dark matter haloes ($j\_{\rm h}\propto M\_{\rm h}^{2/3}$). The shape of this law is crucial to test galaxy formation models, which are currently discrepant especially at the lowest masses, allowing to constrain fundamental parameters, e.g. the retained fraction of angular momentum. In this study, we accurately determine the empirical $j\_\ast-M\_\ast$ relation (Fall relation) for 92 nearby spiral galaxies (from S0 to Irr) selected from the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) sample in the unprecedented mass range $7 \lesssim \log M\_\ast/M\_\odot \lesssim 11.5$. We significantly improve all previous estimates of the Fall relation by determining $j\_\ast$ profiles homogeneously for all galaxies, using extended HI rotation curves, and selecting only galaxies for which a robust $j\_\ast$ could be measured (converged $j\_\ast(\ltR)$ radial profile). We find the relation to be well described by a single, unbroken power-law $j\_\ast\propto M\_\ast^\alpha$ over the entire mass range, with $\alpha=0.55\pm 0.02$ and orthogonal intrinsic scatter of $0.17\pm 0.01$ dex. We finally discuss some implications for galaxy formation models of this fundamental scaling law and, in particular, the fact that it excludes models in which discs of all masses retain the same fraction of the halo angular momentum.},

We combine the effort from 10 different teams, who computed the stellar masses using the same photometry and the same redshifts. Each team adopted their preferred fitting code, assumptions, priors, and parameter grid. The combination of results using the same underlying stellar isochrones reduces the systematics associated with the fitting code and other choices. Thanks to the availability of different estimates, we can test the effect of some specific parameters and assumptions on the stellar mass estimate. The choice of the stellar isochrone library turns out to have the largest effect on the galaxy stellar mass estimates, resulting in the largest distributions around the median value (with a semi interquartile range larger than 0.1 dex). On the other hand, for most galaxies, the stellar mass estimates are relatively insensitive to the different parameterizations of the star formation history. The inclusion of nebular emission in the model spectra does not have a significant impact for the majority of galaxies (less than a factor of 2 for ~80% of the sample). Nevertheless, the stellar mass for the subsample of young galaxies (age <100 Myr), especially in particular redshift ranges (e.g., 2.2 < z < 2.4, 3.2 < z < 3.6, and 5.5 < z < 6.5), can be seriously overestimated (by up to a factor of 10 for <20 Myr sources) if nebular contribution is ignored.},

Galaxies were selected to be more massive than 10 10 M ☉ and have specific star formation rates (SFRs) above 1/ t H . We model the seven-band optical ACS + near-IR WFC3 spectral energy distributions of individual bins of pixels, accounting simultaneously for the galaxy-integrated photometric constraints available over a longer wavelength range. We analyze variations in rest-frame color, stellar surface mass density, age, and extinction as a function of galactocentric radius and local surface brightness/density, and measure structural parameters on luminosity and stellar mass maps. We find evidence for redder colors, older stellar ages, and increased dust extinction in the nuclei of galaxies. Big star-forming clumps seen in star formation tracers are less prominent or even invisible in the inferred stellar mass distributions. Off-center clumps contribute up to ~20% to the integrated SFR, but only 7% or less to the integrated mass of all massive SFGs at z ~ 1 and z ~ 2, with the fractional contributions being a decreasing function of wavelength used to select the clumps. The stellar mass profiles tend to have smaller sizes and M20 coefficients, and higher concentration and Gini coefficients than the light distribution. Our results are consistent with an inside-out disk growth scenario with brief (100-200 Myr) episodic local enhancements in star formation superposed on the underlying disk. Alternatively, the young ages of off-center clumps may signal inward clump migration, provided this happens efficiently on the order of an orbital timescale.},

We measured the flux and the equivalent width for the 11.3 micron PAH feature and the [SIV] line emission as a function of galactocentric distance. This allowed to study the star formation (SF) at sub-kpc scales from the nucleus for a large sample of nearby AGN. The [SIV] line emission could be tracing the AGN radiation field within a few thousand times the sublimation radius (R_sub), but it often peaks at distances greater than 1000 R_sub. One possibility is that the SF is contributing to the [SIV] total flux. We found an 11.3 micron PAH emission deficit within the inner few tens of parsecs from the AGN. This deficit might be due to the destruction of the molecules responsible for this feature or the lack of SF at these distances. We found a sensible agreement in the expected shift of the relation of the AGN bolometric luminosity and the SF rate. This indicates that numerical models attributing the link between AGN activity and host galaxy growth to mergers are in agreement with our data, for most inner galaxy parts.},

However, the origin of significant differences in the shape of number counts at different wavelengths is still unclear. By relating the most remarkable features in the number counts with the underlying galaxy population it is possible to introduce further constraints on galaxy evolution.  <BR />Aims: We aim to investigate the causes of the different shape of the K-band number counts when compared to other bands, analyzing in detail the presence of a change in the slope around K {\tilde} 17.5.  <BR />Methods: We present a near-infrared imaging survey, conducted at the 3.5 m telescope of the Calar Alto Spanish-German Astronomical Center (CAHA), covering two separated fields centered on the HFDN and the Groth field, with a total combined area of 0.27 deg$^{2}$ to a depth of K {\tilde} 19 (3{$\sigma$}, Vega). By combining our data with public deep K-band images in the CDFS (GOODS/ISAAC) and high quality imaging in multiple bands, we extract K-selected catalogs characterized with highly reliable photometric redshift estimates. We derive redshift binned number counts, comparing the results in our three fields to sample the effects of cosmic variance. We derive luminosity functions from the observed K-band in the redshift range [0.25-1.25], that are combined with data from the references in multiple bands and redshifts, to build up the K-band number count distribution.  <BR />Results: The overall shape of the number counts can be grouped into three regimes: the classic Euclidean slope regime (d log N/dm {\tilde} 0.6) at bright magnitudes; a transition regime at intermediate magnitudes, dominated by M$^{ast}$ galaxies at the redshift that maximizes the product {\phis}$^{ast}$$\{$$\{$dV\_c$\}$/$\{$d{$\Omega$}$\}$$\}$; and an {$\alpha$} dominated regime at faint magnitudes, where the slope asymptotically approaches -0.4({$\alpha$}+1) controlled by post-M$^{ast}$ galaxies. The slope of the K-band number counts presents an averaged decrement of  50\% in the range 15.5 $\lt$ K $\lt$ 18.5 (dlog N/dm{\tilde}0.6-0.30). The rate of change in the slope is highly sensitive to cosmic variance effects. The decreasing trend is the consequence of a prominent decrease of the characteristic density {\phis}$^{ast}$$_{K,obs}$ ( 60\% from z=0.5 to z=1.5) and an almost flat evolution of M$^{ast}$$_{K,obs}$ (1{$\sigma$} compatible with M$^{ast}$$_{K,obs}$=-22.89 {\plusmn} 0.25 in the same redshift range).},

Our sample comprises roughly 640,000 galaxies at z ~ 0.1, 130,000 galaxies at z ~ 1, and 36,000 galaxies at z ~ 2. Structural measurements for all but the z ~ 0.1 galaxies are based on Hubble Space Telescope imaging, and SFRs are derived using a Herschel -calibrated ladder of SFR indicators. We find that a correlation between the structure and stellar population of galaxies (i.e., a "Hubble sequence") is already in place since at least z ~ 2.5. At all epochs, typical star-forming galaxies on the main sequence are well approximated by exponential disks, while the profiles of quiescent galaxies are better described by de Vaucouleurs profiles. In the upper envelope of the main sequence, the relation between the SFR and Sérsic index reverses, suggesting a rapid buildup of the central mass concentration in these starbursting outliers. We observe quiescent, moderately and highly star-forming systems to co-exist over an order of magnitude or more in stellar mass. At each mass and redshift, galaxies on the main sequence have the largest size. The rate of size growth correlates with specific SFR, and so does Σ SFR at each redshift. A simple model using an empirically determined star formation law and metallicity scaling, in combination with an assumed geometry for dust and stars, is able to relate the observed Σ SFR and SFR IR /SFR UV , provided a more patchy dust geometry is assumed for high-redshift galaxies.},

In this study, I present results of self-consistent cosmological simulations of high-redshift galaxy formation that reproduce the Schmidt law naturally, without assuming it, and provide some clues to this puzzle. The simulations have a dynamic range high enough to identify individual star-forming regions. The results indicate that the global Schmidt law is a manifestation of the overall density distribution of the interstellar medium. In particular, the density probability distribution function (PDF) in the simulated disks has a well-defined generic shape that can be approximated by a lognormal distribution at high densities. The PDF in a given region of the disk depends on the local average surface density Σ g . The dependence is such that the fraction of gas mass in the high-density tail of the distribution scales as Σ ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-4357/590/1/L1/img1.gif] {img1.gif} with n ≈ 1.4, which gives rise to the Schmidt-like correlation. The high-density tail of the PDF is remarkably insensitive to the inclusion of feedback and details of the cooling and heating processes. This indicates that the global star formation rate is determined by the supersonic turbulence driven by gravitational instabilities on large scales, rather than stellar feedback or thermal instabilities on small scales.},

  abstract = {This paper describes SUNRISE, a parallel, free Monte Carlo code for the calculation of radiation transfer through astronomical dust. SUNRISE uses an adaptive mesh refinement grid to describe arbitrary geometries of emitting and absorbing/scattering media, with spatial dynamical range exceeding 10$^{4}$, and it can efficiently generate images of the emerging radiation at arbitrary points in space. In addition to the monochromatic radiative transfer typically used by Monte Carlo codes, SUNRISE is capable of propagating a range of wavelengths simultaneously. This `polychromatic' algorithm gives significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy when spectral features are calculated. SUNRISE is used to study the effects of dust in hydrodynamic simulations of interacting galaxies, and the procedure for this is described. The code is tested against previously published results.},

This paper presents an implementation of the calculation of dust grain equilibrium temperatures on GPUs in the Monte-Carlo radiation transfer code SUNRISE, using the CUDA API.

  abstract = {An updated version of the dust radiation-transfer code SUNRISE, including models for star-forming regions and a self-consistent calculation of the spatially dependent dust and PAH emission, is presented. Given a hydrodynamic simulation of a galaxy, this model can calculate a realistic 2D ultraviolet-submillimetre spectral energy distribution of the galaxy, including emission lines from HII regions, from any viewpoint. To model the emission from star-forming regions, the MAPPINGSIII photoionization code is used. The high wavelength resolution (\~{}1000 wavelengths) is made possible by the polychromatic Monte Carlo algorithm employed by SUNRISE. From the 2D spectral energy distributions (SEDs), images in any filter bands or integrated galaxy SEDs can be created. Using a suite of hydrodynamic simulations of disc galaxies, the output broad-band images and SEDs are compared with observed galaxies from the multiwavelength SINGS and SLUGS galaxy surveys. Overall, the output SEDs show a good match with observed galaxies in colours ranging from far-UV to submillimetre wavelengths. The only possible exception is the 160/850{$\mu$}m colour, which the simulations underestimate by a factor of \~{}5 compared to the SINGS sample. However, the simulations here agree with the SLUGS galaxies, which consistently have significantly larger amounts of cold dust than the SINGS galaxies. The SUNRISE model can be used to generate simulated observations of arbitrary hydrodynamic galaxy simulations. In this way, predictions of galaxy formation theories can be directly tested against observations of galaxies.},

  abstract = {IR emission spectra are calculated for dust heated by starlight, for mixtures of amorphous silicate and graphitic grains, including varying amounts of PAH particles. The models are constrained to reproduce the average Milky Way extinction curve. The calculations include the effects of single-photon heating. Updated IR absorption properties for the PAHs are presented that are consistent with observed emission spectra, including those newly obtained by Spitzer. We find a size distribution for the PAHs giving emission band ratios consistent with the observed spectra of the Milky Way and other galaxies. Emission spectra are presented for a wide range of starlight intensities. We calculate how the efficiency of emission into different IR bands depends on PAH size; the strong 7.7 {$\mu$}m emission feature is produced mainly by PAH particles containing $\lt$10$^{3}$ C atoms. We also calculate how the emission spectrum depends on U, the starlight intensity relative to the local interstellar radiation field. The submillimeter and far-infrared emission is compared to the observed emission from the local interstellar medium. Using a simple distribution function, we calculate the emission spectrum for dust heated by a distribution of starlight intensities, such as occurs within galaxies. The models are parameterized by the PAH mass fraction q$_{PAH}$, the lower cutoff U$_{min}$ of the starlight intensity distribution, and the fraction {$\gamma$} of the dust heated by starlight with U$\gt$U$_{min}$. We present graphical procedures using Spitzer IRAC and MIPS photometry to estimate the parameters q$_{PAH}$, U$_{min}$, and {$\gamma$}, the fraction f$_{PDR}$ of the dust luminosity coming from photodissociation regions with U$\gt$100, and the total dust mass M$_{dust}$.},

The disk-averaged SFRs and gas densities for the combined sample are well represented by a Schmidt law with index N = 1.4 +/- 0.15. The Schmidt law provides a surprisingly tight parametrization of the global star formation law, extending over several orders of magnitude in SFR and gas density. An alternative formulation of the star formation law, in which the SFR is presumed to scale with the ratio of the gas density to the average orbital timescale, also fits the data very well. Both descriptions provide potentially useful ``recipes'' for modeling the SFR in numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.},

To characterize the decline in star formation rate (SFR) since z\~{}0.7, we estimate the total thermal IR luminosities, SFRs, and stellar masses for the galaxies in this sample. At z\~{}0.7, nearly 40\% of intermediate- and high-mass galaxies (with stellar masses $\gt$=2{\times}10$^{10}$ M$_{solar}$) are undergoing a period of intense star formation above their past-averaged SFR. In contrast, less than 1\% of equally massive galaxies in the local universe have similarly intense star formation activity. Morphologically undisturbed galaxies dominate the total infrared luminosity density and SFR density: at z\~{}0.7, more than half of the intensely star-forming galaxies have spiral morphologies, whereas less than \~{}30\% are strongly interacting. Thus, a decline in major merger rate is not the underlying cause of the rapid decline in cosmic SFR since z\~{}0.7. Physical properties that do not strongly affect galaxy morphology-for example, gas consumption and weak interactions with small satellite galaxies-appear to be responsible.},

  abstract    = {Stellar population and stellar kinematic studies provide unique but complementary insights into how galaxies build-up their stellar mass and angular momentum. A galaxy's mean stellar age reveals when stars were formed, but provides little constraint on how the galaxy's mass was assembled. Resolved stellar dynamics trace the change in angular momentum and orbital distribution of stars due to mergers, but major mergers tend to obscure the effect of earlier interactions. With the rise of large multi-object integral field spectroscopic (IFS) surveys, such as SAMI and MaNGA, and single-object IFS surveys (e.g., ATLAS$^{\rm{3D}}$, CALIFA, MASSIVE), it is now feasible to connect a galaxy's star formation and merger history on the same resolved physical scales, over a large range in galaxy mass, and across the full range of optical morphology and environment. Using the SAMI Galaxy Survey, here we present the first study of spatially-resolved stellar kinematics and global stellar populations in a large IFS galaxy survey. We find a strong correlation of stellar population age with location in the ($V / \sigma$, $\epsilon_{\rm{e}}$) diagram that links the ratio of ordered rotation to random motions in a galaxy to its observed ellipticity. For the large majority of galaxies that are oblate rotating spheroids, we find that characteristic stellar age follows the intrinsic ellipticity of galaxies remarkably well. This trend is still observed when galaxies are separated into early-type and late-type samples.},

Instead of using the azimuthally averaged profiles of data the maps of the gas surface densities (THINGS, HERACLES), of the velocity dispersions of stars (VENGA) and gas (THINGS) and of the surface brightness of the galaxy (S$^4$G) were analyzed. All these maps were collected for the same region with a noticeable star formation rate and were superimposed on each other. Using the data on the rotation curve values of $Q\_\mathrm{eff}$ were calculated for each pixel in the image. The areas within the contours $Q\_\mathrm{eff}\lt3$ were compared with the ongoing star formation regions ($\Sigma\_\mathrm{SFR}\gt 0.007 \, M\_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$) and showed a good coincidence between them. The Romeo-Falstad disc instability diagnostics taking into account the thickness of the stellar and gas layers does not change the result. If the one-fluid instability criterion is used, the coincidence is worse. The analysis was carried out for the area $r \lt $ 0.5$r\_{25} $. Leroy et al. (2008) using azimuthally averaged data obtained $Q\_\mathrm{eff} \approx 3-4$ for this area of the disc, which makes it stable against non-axisymmetric perturbations and gas dissipation, and does not predict the location of star forming regions. Since in the galaxies the distribution of hydrogen and the regions of star formation is often patchy, the relationship between gravitational instability and star formation should be sought using data maps rather than azimuthally averaged data.},

  title       = {The MOSDEF Survey: Metallicity Dependence of the PAH Emission at High Redshift and Implications for 24 micron-inferred IR Luminosities and Star Formation Rates at z~2},
  abstract    = {We present results on the variation of 7.7 micron Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission in galaxies spanning a wide range in metallicity at z ~ 2. For this analysis, we use rest-frame optical spectra of 476 galaxies at 1.37 < z < 2.61 from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey to infer metallicities and ionization states. Spitzer/MIPS 24 micron and Herschel/PACS 100 and 160 micron observations are used to derive rest-frame 7.7 micron luminosities (L(7.7)) and total IR luminosities (L(IR)), respectively. We find significant trends between the ratio of L(7.7) to L(IR) (and to dust-corrected SFR) and both metallicity and [OIII]/[OII] (O32) emission-line ratio. The latter is an empirical proxy for the ionization parameter. These trends indicate a paucity of PAH emission in low metallicity environments with harder and more intense radiation fields. Additionally, L(7.7)/L(IR) is significantly lower in the youngest quartile of our sample (ages of 500 Myr) compared to older galaxies, which may be a result of the delayed production of PAHs by AGB stars. The relative strength of L(7.7) to L(IR) is also lower by a factor of ~ 2 for galaxies with masses $M_* < 10^{10}M_{\odot}$, compared to the more massive ones. We demonstrate that commonly-used conversions of L(7.7) (or 24 micron flux density; f(24)) to L(IR) underestimate the IR luminosity by more than a factor of 2 at $M_*$ ~ $10^{9.6-10.0} M_{\odot}$. We adopt a mass-dependent conversion of L(7.7) to L(IR) with L(7.7)/L(IR)= 0.09 and 0.22 for $M_* < 10^{10}$ and $> 10^{10} M_{\odot}$, respectively. Based on the new scaling, the SFR-$M_*$ relation has a shallower slope than previously derived. Our results also suggest a higher IR luminosity density at z ~ 2 than previously measured, corresponding to a ~ 30% increase in the SFR density.},

  abstract    = {We investigate the recent star formation history (SFH) in the inner region of 57 nearly face-on spiral galaxies selected from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey. For each galaxy we use the integral field spectroscopy from CALIFA to obtain two-dimensional maps and radial profiles of three parameters that are sensitive indicators of the recent SFH: the 4000\AA\ break (D$_n$(4000)), and the equivalent width of H$\delta$ absorption (EW(H$\delta_A$)) and H$\alpha$ emission (EW(H$\alpha$)). We have also performed photometric decomposition of bulge/bar/disk components based on SDSS optical image. We identify a class of 17 "turnover" galaxies whose central region present significant drop in D$_n$(4000), and most of them correspondingly show a central upturn in EW(H$\delta_A$) and EW(H$\alpha$). This indicates that the central region of the turnover galaxies has experienced star formation in the past 1-2 Gyr, which makes the bulge younger and more star-forming than surrounding regions. We find almost all (15/17) the turnover galaxies are barred, while only half of the barred galaxies in our sample (15/32) are classified as a turnover galaxy. This finding provides strong evidence in support of the theoretical expectation that the bar may drive gas from the disc inward to trigger star formation in galaxy center, an important channel for the growth/rejuvenation of pseudobulges in disc galaxies.},

We confirm the blueward shift in the color-magnitude relation for dwarf ellipticals, compared to CMR for bright ellipticals, as seen in previous studies. However, we find the deviation in color across the UV to near-IR for dE's is a strong signal of a younger age for dwarf ellipticals, one that indicates decreasing mean age with lower stellar mass. Lower mass dE's are found to have mean ages of 4 Gyrs and mean [Fe/H] values of -1.2. Age and metallicity increase to the most massive dE's with mean ages similar to normal ellipticals (12 Gyrs) and their lowest metallicities ([Fe/H] = -0.3). Deduced initial star formation rates for dE's, combined with their current metallicities and central stellar densities, suggests a connection between field LSB dwarfs and cluster dE's, where the cluster environment halts star formation for dE's triggering a separate evolutionary path.},

The sample uses data from GALEX, SDSS, 2MASS and Spitzer to cover the filters NUV, ugri, JHK and 3.6mum. Various two-color diagrams, using the half-light aperture defined in the 2MASS J filter, are very coherent from color to color, meaning that galaxies defined to be red in one color are always red in other colors. Comparison to globular cluster colors demonstrates that ellipticals are *not* composed of a single age, single metallicity (e.g., [Fe/H]) stellar population, but require a multi-metallicity model using a chemical enrichment scenario. Such a model is sufficient to explain two-color diagrams and the color-magnitude relations for all colors using only metallicity as a variable on a solely 12 Gyrs stellar population with no evidence of stars younger than 10 Gyrs. The [Fe/H] values that match galaxy colors range from -0.5 to +0.4, much higher (and older) than population characteristics deduced from Lick/IDS line-strength system studies, indicating an inconsistency between galaxy colors and line indices values for reasons unknown. The NUV colors have unusual behavior signaling the rise and fall of the UV upturn with elliptical luminosity. Models with BHB tracks can reproduce this behavior indicating the UV upturn is strictly a metallicity effect.},

  abstract     = {We present the first study of the isotropy of the distribution of morphological types of galaxies in the Local Universe out to around 200 Mpc using more than 60,000 galaxies from the HyperLeda database. We divide the sky into two opposite hemispheres and compare the abundance distribution of the morphological types, $T$, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. This is repeated for different directions in the sky and the KS statistic as a function of sky coordinates is obtained. For three samples of galaxies within around 100, 150, and 200 Mpc, we find a significant hemispherical asymmetry with a vanishingly small chance of occurring in an isotropic distribution. Astonishingly, regardless of this extreme significance, the hemispherical asymmetry is aligned with the Celestial Equator at the 97.1-99.8% and with the Ecliptic at the 94.6-97.6% confidence levels, estimated using a Monte Carlo analysis. Shifting $T$ values randomly within their uncertainties has a negligible effect on this result. When a magnitude limit of $B\leq 15$ mag is applied, the sample within 100 Mpc shows no significant anisotropy after random shifting of $T$. However, the direction of the asymmetry in the samples within 150 and 200 Mpc and $B\leq 15$ mag is found to be within an angular separation of 32 degrees from $(l,b)=(123.7, 24.6)$ with 97.2% and 99.9% confidence levels, respectively. This direction is only 2.6 degrees away from the Celestial North Pole. Unless the Local Universe has a significant anisotropic distribution of galaxy types aligned with the orientation or the orbit of the Earth (which would be a challenge for the Cosmological Principle), our results show that there seems to be a systematic bias in the classification of galaxy morphological types between the data from the Northern and the Southern Equatorial sky. Further studies are absolutely needed to find out the exact source of this anisotropy.},

This H$\alpha$ extension is approximately three times the effective radius of the host galaxy and displays a tail-like morphology. We analyze its gas-phase metallicities, gaseous kinematics, and emission-line ratios, and discuss whether this H$\alpha$ extension could be diffuse ionized gas, a gas accretion event, or something else. We find that this warm, ionized gas structure is most consistent with gas accretion through recycled wind material, which could be an important process that regulates the low-mass end of the galaxy stellar mass function.},

  title       = {Equilibrium model prediction for the scatter in the star-forming main sequence},
  abstract    = {The analytic "equilibrium model" for galaxy evolution using a mass balance equation is able to reproduce mean observed galaxy scaling relations between stellar mass, halo mass, star formation rate (SFR) and metallicity across the majority of cosmic time with a small number of parameters related to feedback. Here we aim to test this data-constrained model to quantify deviations from the mean relation between stellar mass and SFR, i.e. the star-forming galaxy main sequence (MS). We implement fluctuation in halo accretion rates parameterised from merger-based simulations, and quantify the intrinsic scatter introduced into the MS under the assumption that fluctuations in star formation follow baryonic inflow fluctuations. We predict the 1-sigma MS scatter to be ~ 0.2 - 0.25 dex over the stellar mass range 10^8 Mo to 10^11 Mo and a redshift range 0.5 < z < 3 for SFRs averaged over 100 Myr. The scatter increases modestly at z > 3, as well as by averaging over shorter timescales. The contribution from merger-induced star formation is generally small, around 5% today and 10 - 15% during the peak epoch of cosmic star formation. These results are generally consistent with available observations, suggesting that deviations from the MS primarily reflect stochasticity in the inflow rate owing to halo mergers.},

  title       = {Why do high-redshift galaxies show diverse gas-phase metallicity gradients?},
  abstract    = {Recent spatially resolved observations of galaxies at z=0.6-3 reveal that high-redshift galaxies show complex kinematics and a broad distribution of gas-phase metallicity gradients. To understand these results, we use a suite of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project, which include physically motivated models of the multi-phase ISM, star formation, and stellar feedback. Our simulations reproduce the observed diversity of kinematic properties and metallicity gradients, broadly consistent with observations at z=0-3. Strong negative metallicity gradients only appear in galaxies with a rotating disk, but not all rotationally supported galaxies have significant gradients. Strongly perturbed galaxies with little rotation always have flat gradients. The kinematic properties and metallicity gradient of a high-redshift galaxy can vary significantly on short time-scales, associated with starburst episodes. Feedback from a starburst can destroy the gas disk, drive strong outflows, and flatten a pre-existing negative metallicity gradient. The time variability of a single galaxy is statistically similar to the entire simulated sample, indicating that the observed metallicity gradients in high-redshift galaxies reflect the instantaneous state of the galaxy rather than the accretion and growth history on cosmological time-scales. We find weak dependence of metallicity gradient on stellar mass and specific star formation rate (sSFR). Low-mass galaxies and galaxies with high sSFR tend to have flat gradients, likely due to the fact that feedback is more efficient in these galaxies. We argue that it is important to resolve feedback on small scales in order to produce the diverse metallicity gradients observed.},

  title       = {SDSS-IV MaNGA: Bulge-Disc Decomposition of IFU Datacubes (BUDDI)},
  abstract    = {With the availability of large integral-field unit (IFU) spectral surveys of nearby galaxies, there is now the potential to extract spectral information from across the bulges and discs of galaxies in a systematic way. This information can address questions such as how these components built up with time, how galaxies evolve and whether their evolution depends on other properties of the galaxy such as its mass or environment. We present BUDDI, a new approach to fit the two-dimensional light profiles of galaxies as a function of wavelength to extract the spectral properties of these galaxies' discs and bulges. The fitting is carried out using GalfitM, a modified form of Galfit which can fit multi-waveband images simultaneously. The benefit of this technique over traditional multi-waveband fits is that the stellar populations of each component can be constrained using knowledge over the whole image and spectrum available. The decomposition has been developed using commissioning data from the SDSS-IV Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey with redshifts z<0.14 and coverage of at least 1.5 effective radii for a spatial resolution of 2.5 arcsec FWHM and field of view of >22 arcsec, but can be applied to any IFU data of a nearby galaxy with similar or better spatial resolution and coverage. We present an overview of the fitting process, the results from our tests, and we finish with example stellar population analyses of early-type galaxies from the MaNGA survey to give an indication of the scientific potential of applying bulge-disc decomposition to IFU data.},

  abstract     = {We study the properties of 66 galaxies with kinematically misaligned gas and stars from MaNGA survey. The fraction of kinematically misaligned galaxies varies with galaxy physical parameters, i.e. M*, SFR and sSFR. According to their sSFR, we further classify these 66 galaxies into three categories, 10 star-forming, 26 "Green Valley" and 30 quiescent ones. The properties of different types of kinematically misaligned galaxies are different in that the star-forming ones have positive gradient in D4000 and higher gas-phase metallicity, while the green valley/quiescent ones have negative D4000 gradients and lower gas-phase metallicity on average. There is evidence that all types of the kinematically misaligned galaxies tend to live in more isolated environment. Based on all these observational results, we propose a scenario for the formation of star forming galaxies with kinematically misaligned gas and stars - the progenitor accretes misaligned gas from a gas-rich dwarf or cosmic web, the cancellation of angular momentum from gas-gas collisions between the pre-existing gas and the accreted gas largely accelerates gas inflow, leading to fast centrally-concentrated star-formation. The higher metallicity is due to enrichment from this star formation. For the kinematically misaligned green valley and quiescent galaxies, they might be formed through gas-poor progenitors accreting kinematically misaligned gas from satellites which are smaller in mass.},

Based on available optical and near-infrared observations of the HEROES galaxies, we derive the 3D distribution of stars and dust in these galaxies. For the sake of uniformity, we apply the same technique to retrieve galaxy properties for the entire sample: we use a stellar model consisting of a S\'ersic bulge and three double-exponential discs (a superthin disc for a young stellar population and thin and thick discs for old populations). For the dust component, we adopt a double-exponential disc with the new THEMIS dust-grain model. We fit oligochromatic radiative transfer (RT) models to the optical and near-infrared images with the fitting algorithm FitSKIRT and do panchromatic simulations with the SKIRT code at wavelengths ranging from ultraviolet to submillimeter. We confirm the previously stated dust energy balance problem in galaxies: for the HEROES galaxies, the dust emission derived from our RT calculations underestimates the real observations by a factor 1.5-4 for all galaxies except NGC 973 and NGC 5907 (apparently, the latter galaxy has a more complex geometry than we used). The comparison between our RT simulations and the observations at mid-infrared-submillimeter wavelengths shows that most of our galaxies exhibit complex dust morphologies (possible spiral arms, star-forming regions, more extended dust structure in the radial and vertical directions). We suggest that, in agreement with the results from Saftly et al. (2015), the large- and small-scale structure is the most probable explanation for the dust energy balance problem.},

  title       = {A massive core for a cluster of galaxies at a redshift of 4.3},
  abstract    = {Massive galaxy clusters are now found as early as 3 billion years after the Big Bang, containing stars that formed at even earlier epochs. The high-redshift progenitors of these galaxy clusters, termed 'protoclusters', are identified in cosmological simulations with the highest dark matter overdensities. While their observational signatures are less well defined compared to virialized clusters with a substantial hot intra-cluster medium (ICM), protoclusters are expected to contain extremely massive galaxies that can be observed as luminous starbursts. Recent claimed detections of protoclusters hosting such starbursts do not support the kind of rapid cluster core formation expected in simulations because these structures contain only a handful of starbursting galaxies spread throughout a broad structure, with poor evidence for eventual collapse into a protocluster. Here we report that the source SPT2349-56 consists of at least 14 gas-rich galaxies all lying at z = 4.31 based on sensitive observations of carbon monoxide and ionized carbon. We demonstrate that each of these galaxies is forming stars between 50 and 1000 times faster than our own Milky Way, and all are located within a projected region only $\sim$ 130 kiloparsecs in diameter. This galaxy surface density is more than 10 times the average blank field value (integrated over all redshifts) and $>$1000 times the average field volume density. The velocity dispersion ($\sim$ 410 km s$^{-1}$) of these galaxies and enormous gas and star formation densities suggest that this system represents a galaxy cluster core at an advanced stage of formation when the Universe was only 1.4 billion years old. A comparison with other known protoclusters at high redshifts shows that SPT2349-56 is a uniquely massive and dense system that could be building one of the most massive structures in the Universe today.},

Arecibo observations with the 700-800 MHz receiver on the 305-m diameter William E. Gordon Telescope detected, serendipitously, HI in absorption against 4C+15.05 while using it as a bandpass calibrator for another object in an HI absorption project. Although the redshift we derive is different from that commonly in use in the literature (nominally $z=0.405$), it agrees very well with the value of $z=0.833$ determined by \cite{Stickel+96}. This absorption feature is best fitted by a sum of three Gaussians, which yield an average redshift of $z=0.8336 \pm 0.0004$, although without corresponding high resolution imaging it is not possible to say whether the components are parts of outflows or inflows. A total column density of $N(HI) = 2.39 \pm 0.13 \times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ is derived, relatively high compared to many radio-loud sources. These results are compared to various relationships in the literature.},

  abstract    = {We present a composite model and radiative transfer simulations of the massive star forming core W33A MM1. The model was tailored to reproduce the complex features observed with ALMA at $\approx 0.2$ arcsec resolution in CH$_3$CN and dust emission. The MM1 core is fragmented into six compact sources coexisting within $\sim 1000$ au. In our models, three of these compact sources are better represented as disc-envelope systems around a central (proto)star, two as envelopes with a central object, and one as a pure envelope. The model of the most prominent object (Main) contains the most massive (proto)star ($M_\star\approx7~M_\odot$) and disc+envelope ($M_\mathrm{gas}\approx0.4~M_\odot$), and is the most luminous ($L_\mathrm{Main} \sim 10^4~L_\odot$). The model discs are small (a few hundred au) for all sources. The composite model shows that the elongated spiral-like feature converging to the MM1 core can be convincingly interpreted as a filamentary accretion flow that feeds the rising stellar system. The kinematics of this filament is reproduced by a parabolic trajectory with focus at the center of mass of the region. Radial collapse and fragmentation within this filament, as well as smaller filamentary flows between pairs of sources are proposed to exist. Our modelling supports an interpretation where what was once considered as a single massive star with a $\sim 10^3$ au disc and envelope, is instead a forming stellar association which appears to be virialized and to form several low-mass stars per high-mass object.},

The third is a light dark matter particle, coupled to a dark photon. The phase transition is triggered in a ring where the Unruh temperature of a static observer falls below the deSitter temperature, thus explaining the apparent coincidence that Milgrom's $a_0 \approx a_\Lambda = c^2 \sqrt{\frac{\Lambda}{3}}$ This phase transition drives the dark matter particles to a regime characterized by a broken $U(1)$ invariance and an approximate scale invariance. In this regime, the dark matter condenses to a super-current characterized by a differentially rotating ring with a flat rotation curve, coupled to a dark magnetic field. The baryonic Tully Fisher relation is a direct consequence of the approximate scale invariance.},

  abstract    = {[Abridged] We study the abundance and clustering properties of HI at redshifts $z\leqslant5$ using TNG100, a large state-of-the-art magneto-hydrodynamic simulation of a 75 Mpc/h box size. We show that most of the HI lies within dark matter halos and quantify the average HI mass hosted by halos of mass M at redshift z. We find that only halos with circular velocities larger than $\simeq$ 30 km/s contain HI. While the density profiles of HI exhibit a large halo-to-halo scatter, the mean profiles are universal across mass and redshift. The HI in low-mass halos is mostly located in the central galaxy, while in massive halos is concentrated in the satellites. We show that the HI and matter density probability distribution functions differ significantly. Our results point out that for small halos the HI bulk velocity goes in the same direction and has the same magnitude as the halo peculiar velocity, while in large halos differences show up. We find that halo HI velocity dispersion follows a power-law with halo mass. We find a complicated HI bias, with HI becoming non-linear already at $k=0.3$ h/Mpc at $z\gtrsim3$. Our simulation reproduces the DLAs bias value from observations. We find that the clustering of HI can be accurately reproduced by perturbative methods. We identify a new secondary bias, by showing that the clustering of halos depends not only on mass but also on HI content. We compute the amplitude of the HI shot-noise and find that it is small at all redshifts. We study the clustering of HI in redshift-space, and show that linear theory can explain the ratio between the monopoles in redshift- and real-space down to small scales at high redshift. We find that the amplitude of the Fingers-of-God effect is larger for HI than for matter. We point out that accurate 21 cm maps can be created from N-body or approximate simulations rather than full hydrodynamic simulations.},

The spectroscopic data are taken with the optical DOLoRes and near-IR NICS instruments at TNG, and include the previously unexplored range between C III] $\lambda$1910 and [O III] $\lambda\lambda$4959,5007. We investigate the possible presence of multiple BALs by computing "balnicity" and absorption indexes (i.e. BI, BI$_0$ and AI) for the transitions Si IV $\lambda$1400, C IV $\lambda$1549, Al III $\lambda$1860 and Mg II $\lambda$2800. No clear evidence for the presence of absorption features is found in addition to the already known, prominent BAL associated to C IV, which supports a high-ionization BAL classification for APM 08279+5255. We also study the properties of the [O III], H$\beta$ and Mg II emission lines. We find that [O III] is intrinsically weak ($F_{\rm [OIII]}/F_{\rm H\beta} \lesssim 0.04$), as it is typically found in luminous quasars with a strongly blueshifted C IV emission line ($\sim$2500 km s$^{-1}$ for APM 08279+5255). We compute the single-epoch black hole mass based on Mg II and H$\beta$ broad emission lines, finding $M_{\rm BH} = (2 \div 3) \times 10^{10}\mu^{-1}$ M$_\odot$, with the magnification factor $\mu$ that can vary between 4 and 100 according to CO and rest-frame UV-to-mid-IR imaging respectively. Using a Mg II equivalent width (EW)-to-Eddington ratio relation, the EW$_{\rm MgII} \sim 27$ \AA\ measured for APM 08279+5255 translates into an Eddington ratio of $\sim$0.4, which is more consistent with $\mu=4$.

Asymmetric broad profiles of $^{12}$CO lines peaked at $-58$ km s$^{-1}$ are found at the eastern and southwestern edges of the radio emission. This represents a kinematic signature consistent with an SNR-MC interaction. We also find that a superbubble, $\sim 37'$ in radius, appears to surround the SNR from HI 21cm (V$_{\rm {LSR}} \sim -61$-$-68$ km s$^{-1}$), WISE mid-IR, and optical extinction data. We build a multi-band photometric stellar sample of stars within the superbubble region and find 82 OB star candidates. The likely peak distance in the stars' distribution seems consistent with the distance previously suggested for CTB 87. We suggest the arc-like radio emission is mainly the relic of the part of blastwave that propagates into the MC complex and is now in a radiative stage while the other part of blastwave has been expanding into the low-density region in the superbubble. This scenario naturally explains the lack of the X-ray emission related to the ejecta and blastwave. The SNR-MC interaction also favours a hadronic contribution to the {\gamma}-ray emission from the CTB 87 region.},

  abstract = {Using a compilation of 25 studies from the literature, we investigate the evolution of the star-forming galaxy (SFG) main sequence (MS) in stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) out to z ~ 6. After converting all observations to a common set of calibrations, we find a remarkable consensus among MS observations (~0.1 dex 1σ interpublication scatter). By fitting for time evolution of the MS in bins of constant mass, we deconvolve the observed scatter about the MS within each observed redshift bin. After accounting for observed scatter between different SFR indicators, we find the width of the MS distribution is ~0.2 dex and remains constant over cosmic time. Our best fits indicate the slope of the MS is likely time-dependent, with our best-fit log SFR( M * , t ) = (0.84 ± 0.02 – 0.026 ± 0.003 × t )log M * – (6.51 ± 0.24 – 0.11 ± 0.03 × t ), where t is the age of the universe in Gyr. We use our fits to create empirical evolutionary tracks in order to constrain MS galaxy star formation histories (SFHs), finding that (1) the most accurate representations of MS SFHs are given by delayed-τ models, (2) the decline in fractional stellar mass growth for a "typical" MS galaxy today is approximately linear for most of its lifetime, and (3) scatter about the MS can be generated by galaxies evolving along identical evolutionary tracks assuming an initial 1σ spread in formation times of ~1.4 Gyr.},

  title       = {Exploring Simulated Early Star Formation in the Context of the Ultrafaint Dwarf Galaxies},
  abstract    = {Ultrafaint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) are typically assumed to have simple, stellar populations with star formation ending at reionization. Yet as the observations of these galaxies continue to improve, their star formation histories (SFHs) are revealed to be more complicated than previously thought. In this paper, we study how star formation, chemical enrichment, and mixing proceed in small, dark matter halos at early times using a high-resolution, cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation. The goals are to inform the future use of analytic models and to explore observable properties of the simulated halos in the context of UFD data. Specifically, we look at analytic approaches that might inform metal enrichment within and beyond small galaxies in the early Universe. We find that simple assumptions for modeling the extent of supernova-driven winds agree with the simulation on average whereas inhomogeneous mixing and gas flows have a large effect on the spread in simulated stellar metallicities. In the context of the UFDs, this work demonstrates that simulations can form halos with a complex SFH and a large spread in the metallicity distribution function within a few hundred Myr in the early Universe. In particular, bursty and continuous star formation are seen in the simulation and both scenarios have been argued from the data. Spreads in the simulated metallicities, however remain too narrow and too metal-rich when compared to the UFDs. Future work is needed to help reduce these discrepancies and advance our interpretation of the data.},

The large wavelength range of these observations and the availability of spectroscopic redshifts allow us to unambiguously identify the peak of the redshifted thermal emission from dust at \~{}300 {$\mu$}m. The SEDs of both galaxies are reasonably well fit by synthetic templates of local galaxies with L $_{IR}$ \~{} 10$^{11}$ L $_{sun}$-10$^{12}$ L $_{sun}$ yet both galaxies have L $_{IR}$ \~{} 10$^{13}$ L $_{sun}$. This suggests that these galaxies are not high-redshift analogs of the Hyper-LIRGs/ULIRGs used in local templates, but are instead ``scaled up'' versions of local ULIRGs/LIRGs. Several lines of evidence point to both galaxies hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN); however, the relatively cool best-fit templates and the optical emission line ratios suggest that the AGN is not the dominant source heating the dust. For both galaxies, the star formation rate determined from the best-fit FIR SEDs (SFR(L $_{IR}$)) agrees with the SFR determined from the dust-corrected H{$\alpha$} luminosity (SFR(H{$\alpha$})) to within a factor of \~{}2; however, when the SFR of these galaxies is estimated using only the observed 24 {$\mu$}m flux and the standard luminosity-dependent template method (SFR(24 {$\mu$}m)), it systematically overestimates the SFR by as much as a factor of six. A larger sample of 24 K-selected galaxies at z\~{} 2.3 drawn from the Kriek et al. GNIRS sample shows the same trend between SFR(24 {$\mu$}m) and SFR(H{$\alpha$}). Using that sample, we show that SFR(24 {$\mu$}m) and SFR(H{$\alpha$}) are in better agreement when SFR(24 {$\mu$}m) is estimated using the log average of local templates rather than selecting a single luminosity-dependent template, because this incorporates lower luminosity templates. The better agreement between SFRs from lower luminosity templates suggests that the FIR SEDs of the BLAST-detected galaxies may be typical for massive star-forming galaxies at z \~{} 2, and that the majority are scaled up versions of lower luminosity local galaxies.},

These galaxies have near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy that samples the rest-frame Balmer/4000 {\AA} break as well as deep photometry in 13 broadband filters. New to our analysis is Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) data that extend the SEDs into the rest-frame NIR. Comparing parameters determined from SED fits with and without the IRAC data we find that the IRAC photometry significantly improves the confidence intervals of {$\tau$}, A$_{v}$ , M $_{star}$, and SFR for individual galaxies, but does not systematically alter the mean parameters of the sample. We use the IRAC data to assess how well current stellar population synthesis codes describe the rest-frame NIR SEDs of young galaxies where discrepancies between treatments of the thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch phase of stellar evolution are most pronounced. The models of Bruzual and Charlot, Maraston, and Charlot and Bruzual all successfully reproduce the SEDs of our galaxies with $\lt$=5\% differences in the quality of fit; however, the best-fit masses from each code differ systematically by as much as a factor of 1.5, and other parameters vary more, up to factors of 2-3. A comparison of best-fit stellar population parameters from different stellar population synthesis (SPS) codes, dust laws, and metallicities shows that the choice of SPS code is the largest systematic uncertainty in most parameters, and that systematic uncertainties are typically larger than the formal random uncertainties. The SED fitting confirms our previous result that galaxies with strongly suppressed SF account for \~{}50\% of the K-bright population at z\~{} 2.3; however, the uncertainty in this fraction is large due to systematic differences in the specific star formation rates derived from the three SPS models.},

  abstract      = {We compare estimates of stellar mass, M $_{*}$, and dynamical mass, M $_{d}$, for a sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Under the assumption of dynamical homology (i.e.,$\backslash$tilde$\{$M$\}$\_d{\tilde} {$\sigma$}\_0\^{}2 R\_e, where {$\sigma$}$_{0}$ is the central velocity dispersion and R $_{e}$ is the effective radius), we find a tight but strongly nonlinear relation between the two mass estimates: the best-fit relation is M\_* {\prop} $\backslash$tilde$\{$M$\}$\_d\^{}$\{$0.73$\}$, with an observed scatter of 0.15 dex. We also find that, at fixed M $_{*}$, the ratio M\_*/$\backslash$tilde$\{$M$\}$\_d depends strongly on galaxy structure, as parameterized by the S{\'e}rsic index, n. The size of the differential effect is on the order of 0.6 dex across 2 $\lt$ n $\lt$ 10. The apparent n-dependence of M\_*/$\backslash$tilde$\{$M$\}$\_d is qualitatively and quantitatively similar to expectations from simple, spherical and isotropic dynamical models, indicating that assuming homology gives the wrong dynamical mass. To explore this possibility, we have also derived dynamical mass estimates that explicitly account for differences in galaxies' structures. Using this ``structure-corrected'' dynamical mass estimator, M $_{d,n }$, the best-fit relation is M $_{*}$ vprop M $^{0.92±0.01(±0.08)}$ $_{d,n }$ with an observed scatter of 0.13 dex. While the data are thus consistent with a linear relation, they do prefer a slightly shallower slope. Further, we see only a small residual trend in M $_{*}$/M $_{d,n }$ with n. We find no statistically significant systematic trends in M $_{*}$/M $_{d,n }$ as a function of observed quantities (e.g., apparent magnitude, redshift), or as a function of tracers of stellar populations (e.g., H{$\alpha$} equivalent width, mean stellar age), nor do we find significantly different behavior for different kinds of galaxies (i.e.,central versus satellite galaxies, emission versus non-emission galaxies). At 99\% confidence, the net differential bias in M $_{*}$/M $_{d,n }$ across a wide range of stellar populations and star formation activities is lsim0.12 dex ({\ap}40\%). The very good agreement between stellar mass and structure-corrected dynamical mass strongly suggests, but does not unambiguously prove, that (1) galaxy non-homology has a major impact on dynamical mass estimates, and (2) there are no strong systematic biases in the stellar mass-to-light ratios derived from broadband optical spectral energy distributions. Further, accepting the validity of both our stellar and dynamical mass estimates, these results suggest that the central dark-to-luminous mass ratio has a relatively weak mass dependence, but a very small scatter at fixed mass.},

  abstract      = {Scaling relations between galaxy structures and dynamics have been studied extensively for early- and late-type galaxies, both in the local universe and at high redshifts. The abundant differences between the properties of disky and elliptical, or star-forming and quiescent, galaxies seem to be characteristic of the local universe; such clear distinctions begin to disintegrate as observations of massive galaxies probe higher redshifts. In this paper we investigate the existence of the mass fundamental plane of all massive galaxies ({$\sigma$} $\gt$\~{} 100 km s$^{-1}$). This work includes local galaxies (0.05 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 0.07) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, in addition to 31 star-forming and 72 quiescent massive galaxies at intermediate redshift (z \~{} 0.7) with absorption-line kinematics from deep Keck-DEIMOS spectra and structural parameters from Hubble Space Telescope imaging. In two-parameter scaling relations, star-forming and quiescent galaxies differ structurally and dynamically. However, we show that massive star-forming and quiescent galaxies lie on nearly the same mass fundamental plane, or the relationship between stellar mass surface density, stellar velocity dispersion, and effective radius. The scatter in this relation (measured about log {$\sigma$}) is low: 0.072 dex (0.055 dex intrinsic) at z \~{} 0 and 0.10 dex (0.08 dex intrinsic) at z \~{} 0.7. This 3D surface is not unique: virial relations, with or without a dependence on luminosity profile shapes, can connect galaxy structures and stellar dynamics with similar scatter. This result builds on the recent finding that mass fundamental plane has been stable for early-type galaxies since z \~{} 2. As we now find that this also holds for star-forming galaxies to z \~{} 0.7, this implies that these scaling relations of galaxies will be minimally susceptible to progenitor biases owing to the evolving stellar populations, structures, and dynamics of galaxies through cosmic time.},

  abstract      = {The fundamental plane (FP) is an empirical relation between the size, surface brightness, and velocity dispersion of early-type galaxies. This relation has been studied extensively for early-type galaxies in the local universe to constrain galaxy formation mechanisms. The evolution of the zero point of this plane has been extended to high redshifts to study the luminosity evolution of massive galaxies, under the assumption of structural homology. In this work, we assess this assumption by replacing surface brightness with stellar mass density and present the evolution of the ``mass FP'' for massive, quiescent galaxies since z \~{} 2. By accounting for stellar populations, we thereby isolate and trace structural and dynamical evolution. Despite the observed dramatic evolution in the sizes and morphologies of massive galaxies since z \~{} 3, we find that quiescent galaxies lie on the mass FP out to z \~{} 2. In contrast with \~{}1.4 dex evolution in the luminosity FP, average residuals from the z \~{} 0 mass FP are less than \~{}0.15 dex since z \~{} 2. Assuming the Hyde {\amp} Bernardi mass FP slope, we find that this minimal offset scales as (1 + z)$^{-0.095 ± 0.043}$. This result lends credence to previous studies that derived luminosity evolution from the FP. Therefore, despite their compact sizes and suggestions that massive galaxies are more disk-like at z \~{} 2, the relationship between their dynamics and structural properties are consistent with local early-type galaxies. Finally, we find no strong evidence for a tilt of the mass FP relative to the virial plane, but emphasize the need for full models including selection biases to fully investigate this issue.},

Of these, 56 are quiescent with high signal-to-noise absorption line spectra, enabling us to determine robust stellar velocity dispersions for the largest sample yet available beyond a redshift of 1. Together with effective radii measured from deep Hubble Space Telescope images, we calculate dynamical masses and address key questions relating to the puzzling size growth claimed by many observers for quiescent galaxies over the redshift interval 0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2. Our large sample provides the first opportunity to carefully examine the relationship between stellar and dynamical masses at high redshift. We find this relation closely follows that determined locally. We also confirm the utility of the locally established empirical calibration which enables high-redshift velocity dispersions to be estimated photometrically, and we determine its accuracy to be 35\%. To address recent suggestions that progenitor bias{\mdash}the continued arrival of recently quenched larger galaxies{\mdash}can largely explain the size evolution of quiescent galaxies, we examine the growth at fixed velocity dispersion assuming this quantity is largely unaffected by the merger history. Using the velocity dispersion-age relation observed in the local universe, we demonstrate that significant size and mass growth have clearly occurred in individual systems. Parameterizing the relation between mass and size growth over 0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1.6 as RvpropM $^{α}$, we find {$\alpha$} = 1.6 {\plusmn} 0.3, in agreement with theoretical expectations from simulations of minor mergers. Relaxing the assumption that the velocity dispersion is unchanging, we examine growth assuming a constant ranking in galaxy velocity dispersion. This approach is applicable only to the large-dispersion tail of the distribution, but yields a consistent growth rate of {$\alpha$} = 1.4 {\plusmn} 0.2. Both methods confirm that progenitor bias alone is insufficient to explain our new observations and that quiescent galaxies have grown in both size and stellar mass over 0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1.6.},

We investigate dust in distant star-forming galaxies using near-infrared grism spectra of the 3D-HST survey combined with archival multi-wavelength photometry. These data allow us to make a direct comparison between dust around star-forming regions (A $_{V, H II }$) and the integrated dust content (A $_{V, star}$). We select a sample of 163 galaxies between 1.36 $\lt$= z $\lt$= 1.5 with H{$\alpha$} signal-to-noise ratio $\gt$=5 and measure Balmer decrements from stacked spectra to calculate A $_{V, H II }$. First, we stack spectra in bins of A $_{V, star}$, and find that A $_{V, H II }$ = 1.86 A $_{V, star}$, with a significance of {$\sigma$} = 1.7. Our result is consistent with the two-component dust model, in which galaxies contain both diffuse and stellar birth cloud dust. Next, we stack spectra in bins of specific star formation rate (log SSFR), star formation rate (log SFR), and stellar mass (log M $_{*}$). We find that on average A $_{V, H II }$ increases with SFR and mass, but decreases with increasing SSFR. Interestingly, the data hint that the amount of extra attenuation decreases with increasing SSFR. This trend is expected from the two-component model, as the extra attenuation will increase once older stars outside the star-forming regions become more dominant in the galaxy spectrum. Finally, using Balmer decrements we derive dust-corrected H{$\alpha$} SFRs, and find that stellar population modeling produces incorrect SFRs if rapidly declining star formation histories are included in the explored parameter space.},

At shorter wavelengths, the shape is identical to that of the Calzetti et al. relation, but with a lower normalization. Hence, the new attenuation curve results in star formation rates (SFRs) that are {\ap} 20\% lower, and stellar masses that are $\{${$\Delta$} $\}$$\{$log$\}$($\{$M$\}$$^{*}$$\{$/M$\}$$_{⊙ }$){\sime} 0.16 dex lower, than those obtained with the Calzetti relation. We find that the difference in the total attenuation of the ionized gas and stellar continuum correlates strongly with SFR, such that for dust-corrected SFRs {\gsim} 20 M$_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$, assuming a Chabrier initial mass function, the nebular emission lines suffer an increasing degree of obscuration relative to the continuum. A simple model that can account for these trends is one in which the UV through optical stellar continuum is dominated by a population of less-reddened stars, while the nebular line and bolometric luminosities become increasingly dominated by dustier stellar populations for galaxies with large SFRs, as a result of the increased dust enrichment that accompanies such galaxies. Consequently, UV- and SED-based SFRs may underestimate the total SFR at even modest levels of {\ap}20 M$_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$.  Based on data obtained at the W.M.

  abstract      = {With the goal of investigating the degree to which the MIR emission traces the SFR, we analyze Spitzer 8 and 24 {$\mu$}m data of star-forming regions in a sample of 33 nearby galaxies with available HST NICMOS images in the Pa{$\alpha$} (1.8756 {$\mu$}m) emission line. The galaxies are drawn from the SINGS sample and cover a range of morphologies and a factor \~{}10 in oxygen abundance. Published data on local low-metallicity starburst galaxies and LIRGs are also included in the analysis. Both the stellar continuum-subtracted 8 {$\mu$}m emission and the 24 {$\mu$}m emission correlate with the extinction-corrected Pa{$\alpha$} line emission, although neither relationship is linear. Simple models of stellar populations and dust extinction and emission are able to reproduce the observed nonlinear trend of the 24 {$\mu$}m emission versus number of ionizing photons, including the modest deficiency of 24 {$\mu$}m emission in the low-metallicity regions, which results from a combination of decreasing dust opacity and dust temperature at low luminosities. Conversely, the trend of the 8 {$\mu$}m emission as a function of the number of ionizing photons is not well reproduced by the same models. The 8 {$\mu$}m emission is contributed, in larger measure than the 24 {$\mu$}m emission, by dust heated by nonionizing stellar populations, in addition to the ionizing ones, in agreement with previous findings. Two SFR calibrations, one using the 24 {$\mu$}m emission and the other using a combination of the 24 {$\mu$}m and H{$\alpha$} luminosities (Kennicutt and coworkers), are presented. No calibration is presented for the 8 {$\mu$}m emission because of its significant dependence on both metallicity and environment. The calibrations presented here should be directly applicable to systems dominated by ongoing star formation.

  abstract = {We present kinematic measurements of a large sample of galaxies from the Team Keck Redshift Survey in the GOODS-N field. We measure line-of-sight velocity dispersions from integrated emission for 1089 galaxies with median redshift 0.637 and spatially resolved kinematics for a subsample of 380 galaxies. This is the largest sample of galaxies to z\~{}1 with kinematics to date and allows us to measure kinematic properties without morphological preselection. Emission-line widths provide a dynamical measurement for the bulk of blue galaxies. To fit the spatially resolved kinematics, we construct models that fit both line-of-sight rotation amplitude and velocity dispersion. Integrated line width correlates well with a combination of the velocity gradient and dispersion and is a robust measure of galaxy kinematics. The spatial extents of emission and continuum are similar, and there is no evidence that line widths are affected by nuclear or clumpy emission. The measured rotation gradient depends strongly on slit position angle alignment with galaxy major axis, but integrated line width does not. Even for galaxies with well-aligned slits, some have kinematics dominated by dispersion (V/{$\sigma$}$\lt$1) rather than rotation. These are probably objects with disordered velocity fields, not dynamically hot stellar systems. About 35\% of the spatially resolved sample are dispersion dominated; galaxies that are both dispersion dominated and bright exist at high redshift but appear rare at low redshift. This kinematic morphology may probe galaxies' evolutionary state. It is linked to photometric morphology in HST ACS images: dispersion-dominated galaxies include a higher fraction of irregulars and chain galaxies, while rotation-dominated galaxies are mostly disks and irregulars. Only one-third of chain/hyphen galaxies are dominated by rotation; high-redshift elongated objects cannot be assumed to be inclined disks.  Based in part on observations taken at the W. M.

  abstract = {We investigate the well-known correlations between the dynamical mass-to-light ratio (M/L) and other global observables of elliptical (E) and lenticular (S0) galaxies. We construct two-integral Jeans and three-integral Schwarzschild dynamical models for a sample of 25 E/S0 galaxies with SAURON integral-field stellar kinematics to about one effective (half-light) radius R$_{e}$. They have well-calibrated I-band Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 and large-field ground-based photometry, accurate surface brightness fluctuation distances, and their observed kinematics is consistent with an axisymmetric intrinsic shape. All these factors result in an unprecedented accuracy in the M/L measurements. We find a tight correlation of the form (M/L) = (3.80 +/- 0.14) {\times} ({$\sigma$}$_{e}$/200kms$^{-1}$)$^{0.84+/-0.07}$ between the M/L (in the I band) measured from the dynamical models and the luminosity-weighted second moment {$\sigma$}$_{e}$ of the LOSVD within R$_{e}$. The observed rms scatter in M/L for our sample is 18 per cent, while the inferred intrinsic scatter is \~{}13 per cent. The (M/L)-{$\sigma$}$_{e}$ relation can be included in the remarkable series of tight correlations between {$\sigma$}$_{e}$ and other galaxy global observables. The comparison of the observed correlations with the predictions of the Fundamental Plane (FP), and with simple virial estimates, shows that the `tilt' of the FP of early-type galaxies, describing the deviation of the FP from the virial relation, is almost exclusively due to a real M/L variation, while structural and orbital non-homology have a negligible effect. When the photometric parameters are determined in the `classic' way, using growth curves, and the {$\sigma$}$_{e}$ is measured in a large aperture, the virial mass appears to be a reliable estimator of the mass in the central regions of galaxies, and can be safely used where more `expensive' models are not feasible (e.g. in high-redshift studies). In this case the best-fitting virial relation has the form (M/L)$_{vir}$= (5.0 +/- 0.1) {\times}R$_{e}${$\sigma$}$^{2}$$_{e}$/(LG), in reasonable agreement with simple theoretical predictions. We find no difference between the M/L of the galaxies in clusters and in the field. The comparison of the dynamical M/L with the (M/L)$_{pop}$ inferred from the analysis of the stellar population, indicates a median dark matter fraction in early-type galaxies of \~{}30 per cent of the total mass inside one R$_{e}$, in broad agreement with previous studies, and it also shows that the stellar initial mass function varies little among different galaxies. Our results suggest a variation in M/L at constant (M/L)$_{pop}$, which seems to be linked to the galaxy dynamics. We speculate that fast-rotating galaxies have lower dark matter fractions than the slow-rotating and generally more-massive ones. If correct, this would suggest a connection between the galaxy assembly history and the dark matter halo structure. The tightness of our correlation provides some evidence against cuspy nuclear dark matter profiles in galaxies.},

  abstract      = {The assembly of galaxies can be described by the distribution of their star formation as a function of cosmic time. Thanks to the WFC3 grism on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) it is now possible to measure this beyond the local Universe. Here we present the spatial distribution of H{$\alpha$} emission for a sample of 54 strongly star-forming galaxies at z \~{} 1 in the 3D-HST Treasury survey. By stacking the H{$\alpha$} emission, we find that star formation occurred in approximately exponential distributions at z \~{} 1, with a median S{\'e}rsic index of n = 1.0 {\plusmn} 0.2. The stacks are elongated with median axis ratios of b/a = 0.58 {\plusmn} 0.09 in H{$\alpha$} consistent with (possibly thick) disks at random orientation angles. Keck spectra obtained for a subset of eight of the galaxies show clear evidence for rotation, with inclination corrected velocities of 90-330 km s$^{-1}$. The most straightforward interpretation of our results is that star formation in strongly star-forming galaxies at z \~{} 1 generally occurred in disks. The disks appear to be ``scaled-up'' versions of nearby spiral galaxies: they have EW(H{$\alpha$}) \~{} 100 {\AA} out to the solar orbit and they have star formation surface densities above the threshold for driving galactic scale winds.},

  abstract      = {ALMA Cycle 2 observations of the long wavelength dust emission in 180 star-forming (SF) galaxies are used to investigate the evolution of ISM masses at z = 1 to 6.4. The ISM masses exhibit strong increases from z = 0 to $\rm \ltz\gt$ = 1.15 and further to $\rm \ltz\gt$ = 2.2 and 4.8, particularly amongst galaxies above the SF galaxy main sequence (MS). The galaxies with highest SFRs at $\rm \ltz\gt$ = 2.2 and 4.8 have gas masses 100 times that of the Milky Way and gas mass fractions reaching 50 to 80$\backslash$\%, i.e. gas masses 1 - 4$\times$ their stellar masses. For the full sample of galaxies, we find a single, very simple SF law: $\rm SFR \propto M\_{\rm ISM}^{0.9}$, i.e. a `linear' dependence on the ISM mass -- on and above the MS. Thus, the galaxies above the MS are converting their larger ISM masses into stars on a timescale similar to those on the MS. At z $\gt 1$, the entire population of star-forming galaxies has $\sim$5 - 10$\times$ shorter gas depletion times ($\sim0.2$ Gyr) than galaxies at low redshift. These $\{$$\backslash$bf shorter depletion times are due to a different, dominant mode of SF in the early universe$\}$ -- dynamically driven by compressive, high dispersion gas motions and/or galaxy interactions. The dispersive gas motions are a natural consequence of the extraordinarily high gas accretion rates which must occur to maintain the prodigious SF.},

  abstract      = {We use the first systematic data sets of CO molecular line emission in z \~{} 1-3 normal star-forming galaxies (SFGs) for a comparison of the dependence of galaxy-averaged star formation rates on molecular gas masses at low and high redshifts, and in different galactic environments. Although the current high-z samples are still small and biased towards the luminous and massive tail of the actively star-forming `main-sequence', a fairly clear picture is emerging. Independent of whether galaxy-integrated quantities or surface densities are considered, low- and high-z SFG populations appear to follow similar molecular gas-star formation relations with slopes 1.1 to 1.2, over three orders of magnitude in gas mass or surface density. The gas-depletion time-scale in these SFGs grows from 0.5 Gyr at z \~{} 2 to 1.5 Gyr at z \~{} 0. The average corresponds to a fairly low star formation efficiency of 2 per cent per dynamical time. Because star formation depletion times are significantly smaller than the Hubble time at all redshifts sampled, star formation rates and gas fractions are set by the balance between gas accretion from the halo and stellar feedback.  In contrast, very luminous and ultraluminous, gas-rich major mergers at both low and high z produce on average four to 10 times more far-infrared luminosity per unit gas mass. We show that only some fraction of this difference can be explained by uncertainties in gas mass or luminosity estimators; much of it must be intrinsic. A possible explanation is a top-heavy stellar mass function in the merging systems but the most likely interpretation is that the star formation relation is driven by global dynamical effects. For a given mass, the more compact merger systems produce stars more rapidly because their gas clouds are more compressed with shorter dynamical times, so that they churn more quickly through the available gas reservoir than the typical normal disc galaxies. When the dependence on galactic dynamical time-scale is explicitly included, disc galaxies and mergers appear to follow similar gas-to-star formation relations. The mergers may be forming stars at slightly higher efficiencies than the discs.

  abstract = {We investigate models of self-consistent chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium (IGM) from z = 6.0 -$\gt$ 1.5, based on hydrodynamic simulations of structure formation that explicitly incorporate outflows from star-forming galaxies. Our main result is that outflow parametrizations derived from observations of local starburst galaxies, in particular momentum-driven wind scenarios, provide the best agreement with observations of CIV absorption at z \~{} 2-5. Such models sufficiently enrich the high-z IGM to produce a global mass density of CIV absorbers that is relatively invariant from z = 5.5 -$\gt$ 1.5, in agreement with observations. This occurs despite continual IGM enrichment causing an increase in volume-averaged metallicity by \~{} {\times} 5-10 over this redshift range, because energy input accompanying the enriching outflows causes a drop in the global ionization fraction of CIV. Comparisons to observed CIV column density and linewidth distributions and CIV-based pixel optical depth ratios provide significant constraints on wind models. Our best-fitting outflow models show mean IGM temperatures only slightly above our no-outflow case, metal filling factors of just a few per cent with volume-weighted metallicities around 10$^{-3}$ at z \~{} 3, significant amounts of collisionally ionized CIV absorption and a metallicity-density relationship that rises rapidly at low overdensities and flattens at higher ones. In general, we find that outflow speeds must be high enough to enrich the low-density IGM at early times but low enough not to overheat it, and concurrently must significantly suppress early star formation while still producing enough early metals. It is therefore non-trivial that locally calibrated momentum-driven wind scenarios naturally yield the desired strength and evolution of outflows, and suggest that such models represent a significant step towards understanding the impact of galactic outflows on galaxies and the IGM across cosmic time.},

We show that low-redshift galaxies divide into two distinct families at a stellar mass of 3 {\times} 10$^{10}$ M$_{solar}$. Lower-mass galaxies have young stellar populations, low surface mass densities and the low concentrations typical of discs. Their star formation histories are more strongly correlated with surface mass density than with stellar mass. A significant fraction of the lowest-mass galaxies in our sample have experienced recent starbursts. At given stellar mass, the sizes of low-mass galaxies are lognormally distributed with dispersion {$\sigma$}(lnR$_{50}$) \~{} 0.5, in excellent agreement with the idea that they form with little angular momentum loss through cooling and condensation in a gravitationally dominant dark matter halo. Their median stellar surface mass density scales with stellar mass as {$\mu$}$_{*}$\~{}M$^{0.54}$$_{*}$, suggesting that the stellar mass of a disc galaxy is proportional to the three halves power of its halo mass. All of this suggests that the efficiency of the conversion of baryons into stars in low-mass galaxies increases in proportion to halo mass, perhaps as a result of supernova feedback processes. At stellar masses above 3 {\times} 10$^{10}$ M$_{solar}$, there is a rapidly increasing fraction of galaxies with old stellar populations, high surface mass densities and the high concentrations typical of bulges. In this regime, the size distribution remains lognormal, but its dispersion decreases rapidly with increasing mass and the median stellar mass surface density is approximately constant. This suggests that the star formation efficiency decreases in the highest-mass haloes, and that little star formation occurs in massive galaxies after they have assembled.},

By design, these constraints depend only weakly on the {$\alpha$}/Fe element abundance ratio. Our sample includes galaxies of all types spanning the full range in star formation activity, from dormant early-type to actively star-forming galaxies. By analysing a subsample of 44254 high-quality spectra, we show that, in the mean, galaxies follow a sequence of increasing stellar metallicity, age and stellar mass at increasing 4000-{\AA}break strength. For galaxies of intermediate mass, stronger Balmer absorption at fixed 4000-{\AA}break strength is associated with higher metallicity and younger age. We investigate how stellar metallicity and age depend on total galaxy stellar mass. Low-mass galaxies are typically young and metal-poor, massive galaxies old and metal-rich, with a rapid transition between these regimes over the stellar mass range 3 {\times} 10$^{9}$$\lt$\~{}M$_{*}$$\lt$\~{} 3 {\times} 10$^{10}$M$_{solar}$. Both high- and low-concentration galaxies follow these relations, but there is a large dispersion in stellar metallicity at fixed stellar mass, especially for low-concentration galaxies of intermediate mass. Despite the large scatter, the relation between stellar metallicity and stellar mass is similar to the correlation between gas-phase oxygen abundance and stellar mass for star-forming galaxies. This is confirmed by the good correlation between stellar metallicity and gas-phase oxygen abundance for galaxies with both measures. The substantial range in stellar metallicity at fixed gas-phase oxygen abundance suggests that gas ejection and/or accretion are important factors in galactic chemical evolution.},

  abstract      = {We present the modeling of SINFONI integral field dynamics of 18 star-forming galaxies at z \~{} 2 from H{$\alpha$} line emission. The galaxies are selected from the larger sample of the SINS survey, based on the prominence of ordered rotational motions with respect to more complex merger-induced dynamics. The quality of the data allows us to carefully select systems with kinematics dominated by rotation, and to model the gas dynamics across the whole galaxy using suitable exponential disk models. We obtain a good correlation between the dynamical mass and the stellar mass, finding that large gas fractions (M $_{gas}$ {\ap} M $_{*}$) are required to explain the difference between the two quantities. We use the derived stellar mass and maximum rotational velocity V $_{max}$ from the modeling to construct for the first time the stellar mass Tully-Fisher relation at z \~{} 2.2. The relation obtained shows a slope similar to what is observed at lower redshift, but we detect an evolution of the zero point. We find that at z \~{} 2.2 there is an offset in log(M $_{*}$) for a given rotational velocity of 0.41 {\plusmn} 0.11 with respect to the local universe. This result is consistent with the predictions of the latest N-body/hydrodynamical simulations of disk formation and evolution, which invoke gas accretion onto the forming disk in filaments and cooling flows. This scenario is in agreement with other dynamical evidence from SINS, where gas accretion from the halo is required to reproduce the observed properties of a large fraction of the z \~{} 2 galaxies.

The hypothesis is made that stars move off the main sequence after burning about 10 per cent of their hydrogen mass and that stars have been created at a uniform rate in the solar neighborhood for the last five billion years. Using this hypothesis and the observed luminosity function, the rate of star creation as a function of stellar mass is calculated. The total number and mass of stars which have moved off the main sequence is found to be comparable with the total number of white dwarfs and with the total mass of all fainter main-sequence stars, respectively.},

  abstract      = {Much of our knowledge of galaxies comes from analysing the radiation emitted by their stars, which depends on the present number of each type of star in the galaxy. The present number depends on the stellar initial mass function (IMF), which describes the distribution of stellar masses when the population formed, and knowledge of it is critical to almost every aspect of galaxy evolution. More than 50 years after the first IMF determination, no consensus has emerged on whether it is universal among different types of galaxies. Previous studies indicated that the IMF and the dark matter fraction in galaxy centres cannot both be universal, but they could not convincingly discriminate between the two possibilities. Only recently were indications found that massive elliptical galaxies may not have the same IMF as the Milky Way. Here we report a study of the two-dimensional stellar kinematics for the large representative ATLAS$^{3D}$ sample of nearby early-type galaxies spanning two orders of magnitude in stellar mass, using detailed dynamical models. We find a strong systematic variation in IMF in early-type galaxies as a function of their stellar mass-to-light ratios, producing differences of a factor of up to three in galactic stellar mass. This implies that a galaxy's IMF depends intimately on the galaxy's formation history.},

Using our new population synthesis model that accounts for the effect of variable abundance ratios of 11 elements, we analyze very high quality absorption line spectra of 38 early-type galaxies and the nuclear bulge of M31. These data extend to 1 {$\mu$}m and they therefore include the IMF-sensitive spectral features Na I, Ca II, and FeH at 0.82 {$\mu$}m, 0.86 {$\mu$}m, and 0.99 {$\mu$}m, respectively. The models fit the data well, with typical rms residuals $\lt$\~{} 1\%. Strong constraints on the IMF and therefore the stellar mass-to-light ratio, (M/L)$_{stars}$, are derived for individual galaxies. We find that the IMF becomes increasingly bottom-heavy with increasing velocity dispersion and [Mg/Fe]. At the lowest dispersions and [Mg/Fe] values the derived IMF is consistent with the Milky Way (MW) IMF, while at the highest dispersions and [Mg/Fe] values the derived IMF contains more low-mass stars (is more bottom-heavy) than even a Salpeter IMF. Our best-fit (M/L)$_{stars}$ values do not exceed dynamically based M/L values. We also apply our models to stacked spectra of four metal-rich globular clusters in M31 and find an (M/L)$_{stars}$ that implies fewer low-mass stars than a MW IMF, again agreeing with dynamical constraints. We discuss other possible explanations for the observed trends and conclude that variation in the IMF is the simplest and most plausible.},

The sequence of interstellar dust mantle accretion and grain- grain coagulation into aggregates, and their consequences for the interstellar dust size distribution, extinction and dust thermal emission, is explored. The effects of accretion and coagulation on the interstellar gas-to-dust ratio in the Milky Way and in distant galaxies are estimated. The importance of interstellar grain-surface epoxide species is re-visited and the likely and consequent connection between dense interstellar cloud dust and cometary dust explored. A possible connection between and the origin of the suite of interstellar OCN-containing molecules, and their interesting chemistry, is discussed. Finally, pathways to amino acid formation and their likelihood as a universal basis for life everywhere in the universe is speculated upon.},

  abstract      = {We use the results of previous work building a halo model formalism for the distribution of neutral hydrogen, along with experimental parameters of future radio facilities, to place forecasts on astrophysical and cosmological parameters from next generation surveys. We consider 21 cm intensity mapping surveys conducted using the BINGO, CHIME, FAST, TianLai, MeerKAT and SKA experimental configurations. We work with the 5-parameter cosmological dataset of $\{$$\Omega\_m, \sigma\_8, h, n\_s, \Omega\_b$$\}$ assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and the astrophysical parameters $\{$$v\_{c,0}, \beta$$\}$ which represent the cutoff and slope of the HI- halo mass relation. We explore (i) quantifying the effects of the astrophysics on the recovery of the cosmological parameters, (ii) the dependence of the cosmological forecasts on the details of the astrophysical parametrization, and (iii) the improvement of the constraints on probing smaller scales in the HI power spectrum. For an SKA I MID intensity mapping survey alone, probing scales up to $\ell\_{\rm max} = 1000$, we find a factor of $1.1 - 1.3$ broadening in the constraints on $\Omega\_b$ and $\Omega\_m$, and of $2.4 - 2.6$ on $h$, $n\_s$ and $\sigma\_8$, if we marginalize over astrophysical parameters without any priors. However, even the prior information coming from the present knowledge of the astrophysics largely alleviates this broadening. These findings do not change significantly on considering an extended HIHM relation, illustrating the robustness of the results to the choice of the astrophysical parametrization. Probing scales up to $\ell\_{\rm max} = 2000$ improves the constraints by factors of 1.5-1.8. The forecasts improve on increasing the number of tomographic redshift bins, saturating, in many cases, with 4 - 5 redshift bins. We also forecast constraints for intensity mapping with other experiments, and draw similar conclusions.},

  abstract      = {The stellar velocity dispersion, $\sigma$, is a quantity of crucial importance for spiral galaxies, where it enters fundamental dynamical processes such as gravitational instability and disc heating. Here we analyse a sample of 34 nearby spirals from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) spectroscopic survey, and present reliable radial profiles of $\sigma\_{R}$ as well as accurate measurements of $\langle\sigma\_{R}\rangle$, the radial average of $\sigma\_{R}$ over one effective (half-light) radius. We show that there is a trend for $\sigma\_{R}$ to increase with decreasing $R$, consistent with a process of disc heating mediated by local gravitational instabilities and radial inflow, and that $\langle\sigma\_{R}\rangle$ correlates with stellar mass ($M\_{\star}$), molecular gas mass ($M\_{\mathrm{mol}}$), star formation rate ($\mathrm{SFR}$) and other galaxy properties. The most significant and strongest correlation is the one with $M\_{\star}$: $\log\langle\sigma\_{R}\rangle = 0.45\,\log(M\_{\star}/\mbox{M}\_{\odot})-2.77\;[\mbox{km\,s}^{-1}]$, which has a rms scatter of 0.10 dex (26\%). This tight scaling relation is applicable to spiral galaxies of type Sa--Sd and stellar mass $M\_{\star}\approx10^{9.5}\mbox{--}10^{11.5}\ \mbox{M}\_{\odot}$. Simple models that relate $\sigma\_{R}$ to the stellar surface density and disc scale length roughly reproduce that scaling, but overestimate $\langle\sigma\_{R}\rangle$ significantly.},

The aim of the paper is to analyse the propagation of star formation in the galaxy and to understand the role of the ongoing star formation in the evolution of the central 'galaxy-sized' supergiant HI shell (SGS), where all regions of star formation are observed. We show that star formation in the galaxy occurs in large unified complexes rather than in individual giant HII regions. Evidence of the triggered star formation is observed both on scales of individual complexes and of the whole galaxy. We identified two supernova-remnant candidates and one late-type WN star and analysed their spectrum and surrounding-gas kinematics. We provide arguments indicating that the SGS in Holmberg I is destructing by the influence of star formation occurring on its rims.},

These massive starless clump candidates are excellent sites to search for the initial phases of massive star formation before the feedback from massive star formation effects the clump. In this study, we search for the spectroscopic signature of inflowing gas toward starless clumps, some of which are massive enough to form a massive star. We observed 101 starless clump candidates identified in the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) in HCO+ J = 1-0 using the 12m Arizona Radio Observatory telescope. We find a small blue excess of E = (Nblue - Nred)/Ntotal = 0.03 for the complete survey. We identified 6 clumps that are good candidates for inflow motion and used a radiative transfer model to calculate mass inflow rates that range from 500 - 2000 M /Myr. If the observed line profiles are indeed due to large-scale inflow motions, then these clumps will typically double their mass on a free fall time. Our survey finds that massive BGPS starless clump candidates with inflow signatures in HCO+ J = 1-0 are rare throughout our Galaxy.},

  abstract    = {State-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations have star particles with typical mass between $\sim$$10^8$ and $\sim$$10^3$ M$_{\odot}$ according to resolution, and treat them as simple stellar populations. On the other hand, observations in nearby galaxies resolve individual stars and provide us with single star properties. An accurate and fair comparison between predictions from simulations and observations is a crucial task. We introduce a novel approach to consistently populate star particles with stars. We developed a technique to generate a theoretical catalogue of mock stars whose characteristics are derived from the properties of parent star particles from a cosmological simulation. Also, a library of stellar evolutionary tracks and synthetic spectra is used to mimic the photometric properties of mock stars. The aim of this tool is to produce a database of synthetic stars from the properties of parent star particles in simulations: such a database represents the observable stellar content of simulated galaxies and allows a comparison as accurate as possible with observations of resolved stellar populations. With this innovative approach we are able to provide a colour-magnitude diagram from a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. This method is flexible and can be tailored to fit output of different codes used for cosmological simulations. Also, it is of paramount importance with ongoing survey data releases (e.g. GAIA and surveys of resolved stellar populations), and will be useful to predict properties of stars with peculiar chemical features and to compare predictions from hydrodynamical models with data of different tracers of stellar populations.},

  abstract    = {We present a detailed analysis of 317 $2.0 \leq z \leq 2.7$ star-forming galaxies from the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS). Using complementary spectroscopic observations with Keck/LRIS and Keck/MOSFIRE, as well as spectral energy distribution (SED) fits to broadband photometry, we examine the joint rest-UV and rest-optical properties of the same galaxies, including stellar and nebular dust attenuation, metallicity, and star formation rate (SFR). The inferred parameters of the stellar population (reddening, age, SFR, and stellar mass) are strongly dependent on the details of the assumed stellar population model and attenuation curve. Nebular reddening is generally larger than continuum reddening, but with large scatter. Compared to local galaxies, high-redshift galaxies have lower gas-phase metallicities (and/or higher nebular excitation) at fixed nebular reddening, and higher nebular reddening at fixed stellar mass, consistent with gas fractions that increase with redshift. We find that continuum reddening is more strongly correlated than nebular reddening with $12 + \log(\mathrm{O}/\mathrm{H})_{\mathrm{O3N2}}$; this may reflect the dependence of both continuum reddening and O3N2 on the ionizing radiation field produced by the massive stars. Finally, we show that SFRs estimated from the attenuation-corrected H$\alpha$ luminosities are systematically lower than those estimated from the UV continuum, when plausible spectral synthesis models and attenuation curves are assumed.},

  abstract    = {The cloud-scale physics of star formation and feedback represent the main uncertainty in galaxy formation studies. Progress is hampered by the limited empirical constraints outside the restricted environment of the Local Group. In particular, the poorly-quantified time evolution of the molecular cloud lifecycle, star formation, and feedback obstructs robust predictions on the scales smaller than the disc scale height that are resolved in modern galaxy formation simulations. We present a new statistical method to derive the evolutionary timeline of molecular clouds and star-forming regions. By quantifying the excess or deficit of the gas-to-stellar flux ratio around peaks of gas or star formation tracer emission, we directly measure the relative rarity of these peaks, which allows us to derive their lifetimes. We present a step-by-step, quantitative description of the method and demonstrate its practical application. The method's accuracy is tested in nearly 300 experiments using simulated galaxy maps, showing that it is capable of constraining the molecular cloud lifetime and feedback time-scale to $<0.1$ dex precision. Access to the evolutionary timeline provides a variety of additional physical quantities, such as the cloud-scale star formation efficiency, the feedback outflow velocity, the mass loading factor, and the feedback energy or momentum coupling efficiencies to the ambient medium. We show that the results are robust for a wide variety of gas and star formation tracers, spatial resolutions, galaxy inclinations, and galaxy sizes. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can be applied out to high redshift ($z\lesssim4$) with a feasible time investment on current large-scale observatories. This is a major shift from previous studies that constrained the physics of star formation and feedback in the immediate vicinity of the Sun.},

We discuss how the simulation results of different groups can be understood in terms of the basic properties of the soliton. Importantly, simulations imply that the energy per unit mass in the soliton and in the virialised host halo should be approximately equal. This relation lends itself to observational tests, because it predicts that the peak circular velocity, measured for the host halo in the outskirts of the galaxy, should approximately repeat itself in the central region. Contrasting this prediction to the measured rotation curves of well-resolved near-by galaxies, we show that ULDM in the mass range $m\sim (10^{-22}\div 10^{-21})$ eV, which has been invoked as a possible solution to the small-scale puzzles of $\Lambda$CDM, is in tension with the data. We suggest that a dedicated analysis of the Milky Way inner gravitational potential could probe ULDM up to $m\lesssim 10^{-19}$ eV.},

  abstract      = {We use high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations from the FIRE (Feedback in Realistic Environments) project to make predictions for the covering fractions of neutral hydrogen around galaxies at z = 2-4. These simulations resolve the interstellar medium of galaxies and explicitly implement a comprehensive set of stellar feedback mechanisms. Our simulation sample consists of 16 main haloes covering the mass range M$_{h}$ {\ap} 10$^{9}$-6 {\times} 10$^{12}$ M$_{⊙}$ at z = 2, including 12 haloes in the mass range M$_{h}$ {\tilde} 10$^{11}$-10$^{12}$ M$_{⊙}$ corresponding to Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). We process our simulations with a ray tracing method to compute the ionization state of the gas. Galactic winds increase the H I covering fractions in galaxy haloes by direct ejection of cool gas from galaxies and through interactions with gas inflowing from the intergalactic medium. Our simulations predict H I covering fractions for Lyman limit systems (LLSs) consistent with measurements around z {\tilde} 2-2.5 LBGs; these covering fractions are a factor {\tilde}2 higher than our previous calculations without galactic winds. The fractions of H I absorbers arising in inflows and in outflows are on average {\tilde}50 per cent but exhibit significant time variability, ranging from {\tilde}10 to {\tilde}90 per cent. For our most massive haloes, we find a factor {\tilde}3 deficit in the LLS covering fraction relative to what is measured around quasars at z {\tilde} 2, suggesting that the presence of a quasar may affect the properties of halo gas on {\tilde}100 kpc scales. The predicted covering fractions, which decrease with time, peak at M$_{h}$ {\tilde} 10$^{11}$-10$^{12}$ M$_{⊙}$, near the peak of the star formation efficiency in dark matter haloes. In our simulations, star formation and galactic outflows are highly time dependent; H I covering fractions are also time variable but less so because they represent averages over large areas.},

The disk-averaged SFRs and gas densities for the combined sample are well represented by a Schmidt law with index N = 1.4 +/- 0.15. The Schmidt law provides a surprisingly tight parametrization of the global star formation law, extending over several orders of magnitude in SFR and gas density. An alternative formulation of the star formation law, in which the SFR is presumed to scale with the ratio of the gas density to the average orbital timescale, also fits the data very well. Both descriptions provide potentially useful ``recipes'' for modeling the SFR in numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.},

  abstract = {We present, for five spiral galaxies, HI data which, along with the H{$\alpha$} rotation curves, are used to derive the distribution of dark matter within these objects. A new method for extracting rotation curves from HI data cubes is presented, which takes into account the existence of a warp and minimizes projection effects. The rotation curves obtained are tested by taking them as input in the construction of model data cubes that are compared with the observed ones: the agreement is excellent. Model data cubes built using rotation curves obtained with standard methods, such as the first-moment analysis, however, fail the test. The HI rotation curves agree well with the H{$\alpha$} data, where they coexist. Moreover, the combined H{$\alpha$} + HI rotation curves are smooth, symmetric and extend to large radii.  The rotation curves are decomposed into stellar, gaseous and dark matter contributions, and the inferred density distribution is compared with various mass distributions: dark haloes with a central density core, {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) haloes (NFW and Moore profiles), HI scaling and MOND. The observations point to haloes with constant-density cores of size r$_{core}$ \~{} r$_{opt}$ and central densities scaling approximately as {$\rho$}$_{0}$ \~{} r$^{-2/3}$$_{core}$. {$\Lambda$}CDM models (which predict a central cusp in the density profile) are in clear conflict with the data.

The models assume that each galaxy is axisymmetric, with a two-integral distribution function, arbitrary inclination angle, a position-independent stellar mass-to-light ratio Upsilon, and a central massive dark object (MDO) of arbitrary mass M\_{\bull}. They provide acceptable fits to 32 of the galaxies for some value of M\_{\bull} and Upsilon the four galaxies that cannot be fitted have kinematically decoupled cores. The mass-to-light ratios inferred for the 32 well-fitted galaxies are consistent with the fundamental-plane correlation Upsilon \~{} L\^{}0.2, where L is galaxy luminosity. In all but six galaxies the models require at the 95\% confidence level an MDO of mass M\_{\bull} \~{} 0.006M\_bulge = 0.006UpsilonL. Five of the six galaxies consistent with M\_{\bull} = 0 are also consistent with this correlation. The other (NGC 7332) has a much stronger upper limit on M\_{\bull}. We predict the second-moment profiles that should be observed at HST resolution for the 32 galaxies that our models describe well. We consider various parameterizations for the probability distribution describing the correlation of the masses of these MDOs with other galaxy properties. One of the best models can be summarized thus: a fraction f \~{}= 0.97 of early-type galaxies have MDOs, whose masses are well described by a Gaussian distribution in log (M\_{\bull}/M\_bulge) of mean -2.28 and standard deviation \~{}0.51. There is also marginal evidence that M\_{\bull} is distributed differently for ``core'' and ``power law'' galaxies, with core galaxies having a somewhat steeper dependence on M\_bulge.},

Estimates, using semi-analytical methods and essentially based on momentum conservation, are made of possible dust-cleansing effects. Our calculations indicate that the amounts of cleansed neutral gas are limited to a relatively thin shell surrounding the HII region around the early-type stars. It seems possible that the proposed mechanism acting in individual giant molecular clouds may produce significant abundance effects for masses corresponding to single stars or small groups of stars. The effects of cleansing are, however, severely constrained by the thinness of the cleansed shell of gas and by turbulence in the cloud, why the mechanism can hardly be important in cleansing masses corresponding to rich clusters, such as the mass of the original M67.},

We located diffuse X-ray emission from 16 galaxy clusters using Chandra observations. We studied the properties of these clusters and their members, using Chandra data in conjunction with optical and near-IR imaging and spectroscopy. We measured X-ray luminosities and gas temperatures of each cluster, as well as velocity dispersions of their member galaxies. We compared these results to scaling relations derived from virialized clusters, finding significant offsets of up to 3-4$\sigma$ for some clusters, which could indicate they are disturbed or still forming. We explored if other properties of the clusters correlated with these offsets by performing a set of tests of virialization and substructure on our sample, including Dressler-Schectman tests, power ratios, analyses of the velocity distributions of galaxy populations, and centroiding differences. For comparison to a wide range of studies, we used two sets of tests: ones that did and did not use spectral energy distribution fitting to obtain rest-frame colours, stellar masses, and photometric redshifts of galaxies. Our results indicated that the difference between the stellar mass or light mean-weighted center and the X-ray center, as well as the projected offset of the most-massive/brightest cluster galaxy from other cluster centroids had the strongest correlations with scaling relation offsets, implying they are the most robust indicators of cluster virialization and can be used for this purpose when X-ray data is insufficiently deep for reliable $L_X$ and $T_X$ measurements.},

  abstract    = {We present a new Galaxy population synthesis Model (GalMod). GalMod is a star-count model featuring an asymmetric bar/bulge as well as spiral arms and related extinction. The model, initially introduced in Pasetto et al. (2016b), has been here completed with a central bar, a new bulge description, new disk vertical profiles and several new bolometric corrections. The model can generate synthetic mock catalogs of visible portions of the Milky Way (MW), external galaxies like M31, or N-body simulation initial conditions. At any given time, e.g., a chosen age of the Galaxy, the model contains a sum of discrete stellar populations, namely bulge/bar, disk, halo. These populations are in turn the sum of different components: the disk is the sum of spiral arms, thin disks, a thick disk, and various gas components, while the halo is the sum of a stellar component, a hot coronal gas, and a dark matter component. The Galactic potential is computed from these population density profiles and used to generate detailed kinematics by considering up to the first four moments of the collisionless Boltzmann equation. The same density profiles are then used to define the observed color-magnitude diagrams in a user-defined field of view from an arbitrary solar location. Several photometric systems have been included and made available on-line and no limits on the size of the field of view are imposed thus allowing full sky simulations, too. Finally, we model the extinction adopting a dust model with advanced ray-tracing solutions. The model's web page (and tutorial) can be accessed at www.GalMod.org.},

The catalogs include doublets with rest-frame line equivalent widths down to a few ${\rm m\AA}$, all detected at a significance above 3$\sigma$, and covering the redshifts between $1<z \lesssim 5$, properties that make them useful for a wide range of chemical evolution studies.},

Methods: Using the IRAM Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) in combination with the 30m telescope, we have observed in the IRAM large program CORE the 1.37mm continuum and spectral line emission at high angular resolution (\~{}0.4'') for a sample of 20 well-known high-mass star-forming regions with distances below 5.5kpc and luminosities larger than 10\^{}4Lsun. Results: We present the overall survey scope, the selected sample, the observational setup and the main goals of CORE. Scientifically, we concentrate on the mm continuum emission on scales on the order of 1000AU. We detect strong mm continuum emission from all regions, mostly due to the emission from cold dust. The fragmentation properties of the sample are diverse. We see extremes where some regions are dominated by a single high-mass core whereas others fragment into as many as 20 cores. A minimum-spanning-tree analysis finds fragmentation at scales on the order of the thermal Jeans length or smaller suggesting that turbulent fragmentation is less important than thermal gravitational fragmentation. The diversity of highly fragmented versus singular regions can be explained by varying initial density structures and/or different initial magnetic field strengths. Conclusions: The smallest observed separations between cores are found around the angular resolution limit which indicates that further fragmentation likely takes place on even smaller spatial scales. The CORE project with its numerous spectral line detections will address a diverse set of important physical and chemical questions in the field of high-mass star formation.},

We show that the mass-weighted age of a galaxy correlates strongly with stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_*$) and ongoing star-formation (SF) activity, with the stellar content in higher-$\sigma_*$ galaxies having formed earlier and faster. The SFHs of quiescent galaxies are generally consistent with passive evolution since their main SF epoch, but a minority show clear evidence of a rejuvenation event in their recent past. The mean age of stars in galaxies that are star-forming is generally significantly younger, with SF peaking after $z<1.5$ for almost all star-forming galaxies in the sample: many of these still have either constant or rising SFRs on timescales $>100$Myrs. This indicates that $z>2$ progenitors of $z\sim1$ star-forming galaxies are generally far less massive. Finally, despite considerable variance in the individual SFHs, we show that the current SF activity of massive galaxies ($>$L$_*$) at $z\sim1$ correlates with SF levels at least $3$Gyrs prior: SFHs retain `memory' on a large fraction of the Hubble time. Our results illustrate a novel approach to resolve the formation phase of galaxies, and in identifying their individual evolutionary paths, connects progenitors and descendants across cosmic time. This is uniquely enabled by the high-quality continuum spectroscopy provided by the LEGA-C survey.},

Our purpose is to coordinate and facilitate the efforts of a diverse group of researchers in the broad areas of the interstellar medium, Galactic magnetic fields and cosmic rays, and our goal is to develop more comprehensive insights into the structures and roles of interstellar magnetic fields and their interactions with cosmic rays. To achieve a higher level of self-consistency, depth and rigour can only be achieved by the coordinated efforts of experts in diverse areas of astrophysics involved in observational, theoretical and numerical work. We present our view of the present status of this topic, identify its key unsolved problems and suggest a strategy that will underpin our work. The backbone of the consortium is the Interstellar MAGnetic field INference Engine, a publicly available Bayesian platform that employs robust statistical methods to explore the multi-dimensional likelihood space using any number of modular inputs. It provides an interpretation and modelling framework that has the power and flexibility to include a variety of observational, theoretical and numerical lines of evidence into a self-consistent and comprehensive picture of the thermal and non-thermal interstellar media. An important innovation is that a consistent understanding of the phenomena that are directly or indirectly influenced by the Galactic magnetic field, such as the deflection of ultra-high energy cosmic rays or extragalactic backgrounds, is made an integral part of the modelling. The IMAGINE Consortium, which is informal by nature and open to new participants, hereby presents a methodological framework for the modelling and understanding of Galactic magnetic fields that is available to all communities whose research relies on a state-of-the-art solution to this problem.

The improvements concern: (a) an enlarged spectral library including Pop III stars; (b) the inclusion of spectral noise in the training procedure, and (c) an accurate evaluation of uncertainties. We extensively validate the optimized code and compare its performance against empirical methods and other available emission line codes (PYQZ and HII-CHI-MISTRY) on a sample of 62 SDSS stacked galaxy spectra and 75 observed HII regions. Very good agreement is found for metallicity. However, ionization parameters derived by GAME tend to be higher. We show that this is due to the use of too limited libraries in the other codes. The main advantages of GAME are the simultaneous use of all the measured spectral lines, and the extremely short computational times. We finally discuss the code potential and limitations.},

Consequently, we are able to measure the integrated extragalactic background light from discrete sources at these frequencies. By integrating down to a 1.4 GHz flux density of $\approx$2$ \mu$Jy, we measure integrated, extragalactic brightness temperatures from discrete sources of $105.63\pm10.56 $mK, $21.76\pm3.09 \mu$K, $8.80\pm0.95 \mu$K, $2.59\pm0.27 \mu$K, and $1.15\pm0.10 \mu$k at 1.4, 30, 44, 70, and 100 GHz, respectively. Our measurement at 1.4 GHz is slightly larger than previous measurements, most likely due to using NVSS data compared to older interferometric data in the literature, but still remains a factor of $\approx$4.5 below that required to account for the excess extragalactic sky brightness measured at 1.4 GHz by ARCADE 2. The fit to ARCADE 2 total extragalactic sky brightness measurements is also a factor of $\approx$8.6, 6.6, 6.2, and 4.9 times brighter than what we estimate from discrete sources at 30, 44, 70 and 100 GHz, respectively. The extragalactic sky spectrum (i.e., $T\_{\rm b} \propto \nu^{\beta}$) from discrete sources appears to flatten with increasing frequency, having a spectral index of $\beta=-2.82\pm0.06$ between 1.4 and 30 GHz and $\beta=-2.39\pm0.12$ between 30 and 100 GHz. We believe that the spectral flattening most likely arises from a combination of Gigahertz-peaked sources and the spectral hardening of radio-detected sources at higher frequencies, particularly at faint flux densities. However, the precise origin of a hard component of energetic electrons responsible for the emission remains unclear.},

Clump1, which concentrates \~{}1/3 of the whole disk flux density at \~{}1cm, is resolved as a narrow arc with a deprojected aspect ratio chi$\gt$5.3, and with half the azimuthal width than at 342 GHz. The spectral trends in the morphology of Clump1 are quantitatively consistent with the Lyra-Lin prescriptions for dust trapping in an anticyclonic vortex, provided with a very elongated chi\~{}16 and cold T\~{}20K vortex. Such physical conditions imply an appreciably optically thick continuum even in cm-waves. A secondary and shallower peak at 342GHz is \~{}twice fainter relative to Clump1 at 33GHz.

  abstract    = {The 9.7$\mu$m interstellar spectral feature, arising from the Si--O stretch of amorphous silicate dust, is the strongest extinction feature in the infrared (IR). In principle, the spectral profile of this feature could allow one to diagnose the mineralogical composition of interstellar silicate material. However, observationally, the 9.7$\mu$m interstellar silicate extinction profile is not well determined. Here we utilize the Spitzer/IRS spectra of five early-type (one O- and four B-type) stars and compare them with that of unreddened stars of the same spectral type to probe the interstellar extinction of silicate dust around 9.7$\mu$m. We find that, while the silicate extinction profiles all peak at ~9.7$\mu$m, two stars exhibit a narrow feature of FWHM ~2.0$\mu$m and three stars display a broad feature of FWHM ~3.0$\mu$m. We also find that the width of the 9.7$\mu$m extinction feature does not show any environmental dependence. With a FWHM of ~2.2$\mu$m, the mean 9.7\mu m extinction profile, obtained by averaging over our five stars, closely resembles that of the prototypical diffuse interstellar medium along the lines of sight toward Cyg OB2 No.12 and WR 98a. Finally, an analytical formula is presented to parameterize the interstellar extinction in the IR at $0.9\mu {\rm m} < \lambda < 15\mu {\rm m}$.},

  abstract    = {We use a suite of cosmological zoom galaxy formation simulations and dust radiative transfer calculations to explore the use of the monochromatic 850 $\mu$m luminosity (L$_{\nu,850}$) as a molecular gas mass (M$_{\rm mol}$) estimator in galaxies between $0 < z < 9.5$ for a broad range of masses. For our fiducial simulations, where we assume the dust mass is linearly related to the metal mass, we find that empirical L$_{\nu,850}$-M$_{\rm mol}$ calibrations accurately recover the molecular gas mass of our model galaxies, and that the L$_{\nu,850}$-dependent calibration is preferred. We argue the major driver of scatter in the L$_{\nu,850}$-M$_{\rm mol}$ relation arises from variations in the molecular gas to dust mass ratio, rather than variations in the dust temperature, in agreement with the previous study of Liang et al. Emulating a realistic measurement strategy with ALMA observing bands that are dependent on the source redshift, we find that estimating S$_{\nu,850}$ from continuum emission at a different frequency contributes 10-20% scatter to the L$_{\nu,850}$-M$_{\rm mol}$ relation. This additional scatter arises from a combination of mismatches in assumed T$_{\rm dust}$ and $\beta$ values, as well as the fact that the SEDs are not single-temperature blackbodies. Finally we explore the impact of a dust prescription in which the dust-to-metals ratio varies with metallicity. Though the resulting mean dust temperatures are $\sim 50\%$ higher, the dust mass is significantly decreased for low-metallicity halos. As a result, the observationally calibrated L$_{\nu,850}$-M$_{\rm mol}$ relation holds for massive galaxies, independent of the dust model, but below L$_{\nu,850}\lesssim10^{28}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (metallicities $\log_{10}({\rm Z}/{\rm Z}_{\odot})\lesssim -0.8$) we expect galaxies will deviate from literature observational calibrations by $\gtrsim0.5$ dex.},

The deep exposures allow us to target individual spectra of massive galaxies to F160W=22.5AB. Our fitting approach uses a set of six base models adapted to the redshift and spectral resolution of each observation, and fits the weights of the base models via a MCMC method. The sample comprises a mixed distribution of quiescent (19) and star-forming galaxies (33). Using the cumulative distribution of stellar ages by mass, we define a ``quenching timescale'' that is found to correlate with stellar mass. The other population parameters, aside from metallicity, do not show such a strong correlation, although all display the characteristic segregation between quiescent and star-forming populations. Radial colour gradients within each galaxy are also explored, finding a wider scatter in the star-forming subsample, but no conclusive trend with respect to the population parameters. Environment is also studied, with at most a subtle effect towards older ages in high-density environments.},

To alleviate this problem, Zhang (2010, MNRAS, 406, L95) proposed a self-calibration method, independent of IA modeling. This proposal relies on several scaling relations between two point clustering of IA and matter/galaxy fields, which were previously only tested with analytical IA models. In this paper, these relations are tested comprehensively with a $N$-body simulation of $3072^3$ simulation particles and boxsize 600 $h^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc}$. They are verified at the accuracy level of $\mathcal{O}(1)\\%$ over angular scales and source redshifts of interest. We further confirm that these scaling relations are generic, insensitive to halo mass, weighting in defining halo ellipticities, photo-$z$ error, and mis-alignment between galaxy ellipticities and halo ellipticities. We also present and verify three new scaling relations on the B-mode IA. These results consolidate and complete the theory side of the proposed self-calibration technique.},

  abstract    = {We introduce a new dual power law (DPL) probability distribution function for the mass distribution of stellar and substellar objects at birth, otherwise known as the initial mass function (IMF). The model contains both deterministic and stochastic elements, and provides a unified framework within which to view the formation of brown dwarfs and stars resulting from an accretion process that starts from extremely low mass seeds. It does not depend upon a top down scenario of collapsing (Jeans) masses or an initial lognormal or otherwise IMF-like distribution of seed masses. Like the modified lognormal power law (MLP) distribution, the DPL distribution has a power law at the high mass end, as a result of exponential growth of mass coupled with equally likely stopping of accretion at any time interval. Unlike the MLP, a power law decay also appears at the low mass end of the IMF. This feature is closely connected to the accretion stopping probability rising from an initially low value up to a high value. This might be associated with physical effects of ejections sometimes (i.e., rarely) stopping accretion at early times followed by outflow driven accretion stopping at later times, with the transition happening at a critical time (therefore mass). Comparing the DPL to empirical data, the critical mass is close to the substellar mass limit, suggesting that the onset of nuclear fusion plays an important role in the subsequent accretion history of a young stellar object.},

  abstract    = {Interstellar dust is an important component of the galactic ecosystem, playing a key role in multiple galaxy formation processes. We present a novel numerical framework for the dynamics and size evolution of dust grains implemented in the moving-mesh hydrodynamics code AREPO suited for cosmological galaxy formation simulations. We employ a particle-based method for dust subject to dynamical forces including drag and gravity. The drag force is implemented using a second-order semi-implicit integrator and validated using several dust-hydrodynamical test problems. Each dust particle has a grain size distribution, describing the local abundance of grains of different sizes. The grain size distribution is discretised with a second-order piecewise linear method and evolves in time according to various dust physical processes, including accretion, sputtering, shattering, and coagulation. We present a novel scheme for stochastically forming dust during stellar evolution and new methods for sub-cycling of dust physics time-steps. Using this model, we simulate an isolated disc galaxy to study the impact of dust physical processes that shape the interstellar grain size distribution. We demonstrate, for example, how dust shattering shifts the grain size distribution to smaller sizes resulting in a significant rise of radiation extinction from optical to near-ultraviolet wavelengths. Our framework for simulating dust and gas mixtures can readily be extended to account for other dynamical processes relevant in galaxy formation, like magnetohydrodynamics, radiation pressure, and thermo-chemical processes.},

We have carried out a high-resolution IR spectroscopic study of 72 M giants in the inner bulge using the CRIRES (ESO/VLT) facility. Our spectra cover the wavelength range of 2.0818 - 2.1444 $\mu$m with the resolution of R$\sim$50,000 and have signal-to-noise ratio of 50 - 100. Our stars are located along the bulge minor axis at l = 0$^\circ$, b = $\pm$0$^\circ$, $\pm$1$^\circ$, $\pm$2$^\circ$ and +3$^\circ$, selected with the aim of investigating any North-South asymmetries in the metallicity distribution function and composition, and comparing them to the outer bulge fields. Our sample was analysed in a homogeneous way using the most current K-band line list. We clearly detect a bimodal MDF with a metal-rich peak at $\rm \sim +0.3\,dex$ and a metal-poor peak at $\rm \sim -0.5\,dex$. Only a single star is found to exceed $\rm [Fe/H]=+0.5\,dex$. They show a symmetric behaviour along the $\pm$1$^\circ$, $\pm$2$^\circ$ fields. The Galactic Center field reveals in contrast a mainly metal-rich population with a mean metallicity of $\rm +0.3\,dex$. We derived $\rm [Mg/Fe]$ and $\rm [Si/Fe]$ abundances which are consistent with trends from the outer bulge, with a gradually decreasing trend with increasing metallicity. We confirm for the supersolar metallicity stars the decreasing trend in \mgfe\ and \sife\ as expected from chemical evolution models. With the caveat of a relatively small sample, we do not find significant differences in the chemical abundances between the Northern and the Southern fields, hence the evidence is consistent with symmetry in chemistry between North and South.},

We employ HI, SFR, stellar mass, and metallicity (gradient) measurements from the literature, spanning a wide range (5 dex) in stellar and gas mass and (1.6 dex) in metallicity. We consider metallicities as observed, or rescaled to match the mass-metallicity relation determined for SDSS galaxies. At intermediate to high metallicities (0.3-2 times solar), we find that the HI surface densities saturate at sufficiently large total gas surface density. The maximal HI columns vary approximately inversely with metallicity, and show little variation with spatial resolution, galactocentric radius, or among galaxies. In the central parts of massive spiral galaxies the HI gas is depressed by factors of 2. The observed behavior is naturally reproduced by metallicity dependent shielding theories for the HI-to-H2 transitions in star-forming galaxies. We show that the inverse scaling of the maximal HI columns with metallicity suggests that the area filling fraction of atomic-molecular complexes in galaxies is of order unity, and weakly dependent on metallicity.},

  abstract    = {Context. The presence of dust in the neutral interstellar medium (ISM) dramatically changes the metal abundances that we measure. Understanding the metal content in the neutral ISM, and a direct comparison between different environments, has been hampered to date because of the degeneracy to the observed ISM abundances caused by the effects of metallicity, the presence of dust, and nucleosynthesis. Aims. We study the metal and dust content in the neutral ISM consistently in different environments, and assess the universality of recently discovered sequences of relative abundances. We also intend to assess the validity of [Zn/Fe] as a tracer of dust in the ISM. This has recently been cast into doubt based on observations of stellar abundances, and needs to be addressed before we can safely use it to study the ISM. Methods. In this letter we present a simple comparison of relative abundances observed in the neutral ISM in the Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds, and damped Lyman-{\alpha} Absorbers (DLAs). The main novelty in this comparison is the inclusion of the Magellanic Clouds. Results. The same sequences of relative abundances are valid for the Galaxy, Magellanic Clouds, and DLAs. These sequences are driven by the presence of dust in the ISM and seem 'universal'. Conclusions. The metal and dust properties in the neutral ISM appear to follow a similar behaviour in different environments. This suggests that a dominant fraction of the dust budget is built up from grain growth in the ISM depending of the physical conditions and regardless of the star formation history of the system. In addition, the DLA gas behaves like the neutral ISM, at least from a chemical point of view. Finally, despite the deviations in [Zn/Fe] observed in stellar abundances, [Zn/Fe] is a robust dust tracer in the ISM of different environments, from the Galaxy to DLAs.},

Using a recent theory for the addition of cosmic ray-induced reactions to astrochemical models, we calculated the radiochemical yields, called $G$ values, for the primary dust grain ice-mantle constituents. We show that the inclusion of this non-thermal chemistry can lead to the formation of complex organic molecules from simpler ice-mantle constituents, even under cold core conditions. In addition to enriching ice-mantles, we find that these new radiation-chemical processes can lead to increased gas-phase abundances as well, particularly for HOCO, NO$_2$, HC$_2$O, methyl formate (HCOOCH$_3$), and ethanol (CH$_3$CH$_2$OH). These model results imply that HOCO - and perhaps NO$_2$ - might be observable in TMC-1. Future detections of either of these two species in cold interstellar environments could provide strong support for the importance of cosmic ray-driven radiation chemistry. The increased gas-phase abundance of methyl formate can be compared with abundances achieved through other formation mechanisms such as pure gas-phase chemistry and three-body surface reactions.},

  title       = {CHORUS II. Subaru/HSC Determination of the Ly$α$ Luminosity Function at $z=7.0$: Constraints on Cosmic Reionization Model Parameter},
  abstract    = {We present the Ly$\alpha$ luminosity function (LF) derived from 34 Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at $z=7.0$ on the sky of $3.1$ deg$^2$, the largest sample so far obtained at a redshift $z\gtrsim7$. The LAE sample is made by deep large-area Subaru narrowband observations conducted by the Cosmic HydrOgen Reionization Unveiled with Subaru (CHORUS) project. The $z=7.0$ Ly$\alpha$ LF of our project is consistent with those of the previous DECam and Subaru studies at the bright and faint ends, respectively, while our $z=7.0$ Ly$\alpha$ LF has uncertainties significantly smaller than those of the previous study results. Exploiting the small errors of our measurements, we investigate the shape of the faint to bright-end Ly$\alpha$ LF. We find that the $z=7.0$ Ly$\alpha$ LF shape can be explained by the steep slope of $\alpha \simeq -2.5$ suggested at $z=6.6$, and that there is no clear signature of a bright-end excess at $z\simeq 7$ claimed by the previous work, which was thought to be made by the ionized bubbles around bright LAEs whose Ly$\alpha$ photons could easily escape from the partly neutral IGM at $z\simeq 7$. We estimate the Ly$\alpha$ luminosity densities (LDs) with Ly$\alpha$ LFs at $z\simeq 6-8$ given by our and the previous studies, and compare the evolution of the UV-continuum LD estimated with dropouts. The Ly$\alpha$ LD monotonically decreases from $z\sim 6$ to $8$, and evolves stronger than the UV-continuum LD, indicative of the Ly$\alpha$ damping wing absorption of the IGM towards the heart of the reionization epoch.},

  abstract    = {We evaluate dust-corrected far ultraviolet (FUV) star formation rates (SFRs) for samples of star-forming galaxies at $z\sim0$ and $z\sim0.7$ and find significant differences between values obtained through corrections based on UV colour, from a hybrid mid-infrared (MIR) plus FUV relation, and from a radiative transfer based attenuation correction method. The performances of the attenuation correction methods are assessed by their ability to remove the dependency of the corrected SFR on inclination, as well as returning, on average, the expected population mean SFR. We find that combining MIR (rest-frame $\sim$13$\mu$m) and FUV luminosities gives the most inclination independent SFRs and reduces the intrinsic SFR scatter out of the methods tested. However, applying the radiative transfer based method of Tuffs et al. gives corrections to the FUV SFR that are inclination independent and in agreement with the expected SFRs at both $z\sim0$ and $z\sim0.7$. SFR corrections based on the UV-slope perform worse than the other two methods tested. For our local sample, the UV-slope method works on average but does not remove inclination biases. At $z\sim$0.7 we find that the UV-slope correction used locally flattens the inclination dependence compared to the raw FUV measurements but was not sufficient to correct for the large attenuation observed at $z\sim$0.7.},

Abundances in the catalog were derived from averaged spectra, obtained by stacking individual spectra according to central velocity dispersion, as a proxy of galaxy mass. We tested initial mass functions already used in a previous work, as well as two new models, based on low-mass tapered ("bimodal") IMFs, where the IMF becomes either (1) bottom-heavy in more massive galaxies, or (2) is time-dependent, switching from top-heavy to bottom-heavy in the course of galactic evolution. We found that the best agreement between models and observations is given either by models with a constant, Salpeter IMF, or by those with a time-dependent distribution. We further tested the models by calculating their M/L ratios. We conclude that a constant, time-independent bottom-heavy IMF does not reproduce the data, especially the increase of the [{\alpha}/Fe] ratio with galactic stellar mass, whereas a variable IMF, switching to bottom-heavy at late times can match observations.},

We examine the environments of low redshift ($z<0.2$) radio-selected AGN, quantified through galaxy clustering, and find that halo mass provides similar mass scalings to black hole mass in the Fundamental Plane relations. AGN properties are strongly environment-dependent: massive haloes are more likely to host radiatively inefficient (low-excitation) radio AGN, as well as a higher fraction of radio luminous, extended sources. These AGN populations have different radio -- optical luminosity scaling relations, and the observed mass scalings in the parent AGN sample are built up by combining populations preferentially residing in different environments. Accounting for environment-driven selection effects, the optical Fundamental Plane of supermassive black holes is likely to be mass-independent, as predicted by models.},

This work is part of the B-fields In Star-forming Region Observations (BISTRO) survey initiated to understand the role of magnetic fields in star formation for nearby star-forming molecular clouds. We present a first look at the geometry and strength of magnetic fields in Oph-B. The field geometry is traced over $\sim$0.2 pc, with clear detection of both of the sub-clumps of Oph-B. The field pattern appears significantly disordered in sub-clump Oph-B1. The field geometry in Oph-B2 is more ordered, with a tendency to be along the major axis of the clump, parallel to the filamentary structure within which it lies. The degree of polarization decreases systematically towards the dense core material in the two sub-clumps. The field lines in the lower density material along the periphery are smoothly joined to the large scale magnetic fields probed by NIR polarization observations. We estimated a magnetic field strength of 630$\pm$410 $\mu$G in the Oph-B2 sub-clump using a Davis-Chandeasekhar-Fermi analysis. With this magnetic field strength, we find a mass-to-flux ratio $\lambda$= 1.6$\pm$1.1, which suggests that the Oph-B2 clump is slightly magnetically super-critical.},

  abstract    = {We discuss the nature of a discrete, compact radio source (NGC 4725 B) located $\approx$1.9 kpc from the nucleus in the nearby star-forming galaxy NGC 4725, which we believe to be a new detection of extragalactic Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME). Based on detections at 3, 15, 22, 33, and 44 GHz, NGC 4725 B is a $\mu$Jy radio source peaking at $\approx$33 GHz. While the source is not identified in $BVRI$ photometry, we detect counterparts in the mid-infrared $Spitzer$/IRAC bands (3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0 $\mu$m) that appear to be associated with dust emission in the central region of NGC 4725. Consequently, we conclude that NGC 4725 B is a new detection of AME, and very similar to a recent detection of AME in an outer-disk star-forming region in NGC 6946. We find that models of electric dipole emission from rapidly rotating ultra-small grains are able to reproduce the radio spectrum for reasonable interstellar medium conditions. Given the lack of an optical counterpart and the shape of the radio spectrum, NGC 4725 B appears consistent with a nascent star-forming region in which young ($\lesssim 3$ Myr) massive stars are still highly enshrouded by their natal cocoons of gas and dust with insufficient supernovae occurring to produce a measurable amount of synchrotron emission.},

  abstract    = {Observations have revealed that the star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (M$_{\rm star}$) of star-forming galaxies follow a tight relation known as the galaxy main sequence. However, what physical information is encoded in this relation is under debate. Here, we use the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to study the mass dependence, evolution and origin of scatter in the SFR-M$_{\rm star}$ relation. At $z=0$, we find that the scatter decreases slightly with stellar mass from 0.35 dex at M$_{\rm star} \approx 10^9$ M$_{\odot}$ to 0.30 dex at M$_{\rm star} \gtrsim 10^{10.5}$ M$_{\odot}$, in excellent agreement with observations. The scatter decreases from $z=0$ to $z=5$ by 0.05 dex at M$_{\rm star} \gtrsim 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ and by 0.15 dex for lower masses. We show that the scatter at $z=0.1$ originates from a combination of (slightly dominant) fluctuations on short time-scales ($\lesssim 1$ Gyr) that are presumably associated with self-regulation from cooling, star formation and outflows, and long time-scale ($\sim 10$ Gyr) variations related to differences in halo formation times. At high masses, differences in black hole formation efficiency cause additional scatter, but also diminish the scatter caused by different halo formation times. While individual galaxies cross the main sequence multiple times during their evolution, they fluctuate around tracks associated with their halo properties, i.e. galaxies above/below the main sequence at $z = 0.1$ tend to have been above/below the main sequence for $\gg1$ Gyr.},

  abstract = {After stars formed in the early Universe, their ultraviolet light is expected, eventually, to have penetrated the primordial hydrogen gas and altered the excitation state of its 21-centimetre hyperfine line. This alteration would cause the gas to absorb photons from the cosmic microwave background, producing a spectral distortion that should be observable today at radio frequencies of less than 200 megahertz. Here we report the detection of a flattened absorption profile in the sky-averaged radio spectrum, which is centred at a frequency of 78 megahertz and has a best-fitting full-width at half-maximum of 19 megahertz and an amplitude of 0.5 kelvin. The profile is largely consistent with expectations for the 21-centimetre signal induced by early stars; however, the best-fitting amplitude of the profile is more than a factor of two greater than the largest predictions. This discrepancy suggests that either the primordial gas was much colder than expected or the background radiation temperature was hotter than expected. Astrophysical phenomena (such as radiation from stars and stellar remnants) are unlikely to account for this discrepancy; of the proposed extensions to the standard model of cosmology and particle physics, only cooling of the gas as a result of interactions between dark matter and baryons seems to explain the observed amplitude. The low-frequency edge of the observed profile indicates that stars existed and had produced a background of Lyman-{$\alpha$} photons by 180{\thinsp}million years after the Big Bang. The high-frequency edge indicates that the gas was heated to above the radiation temperature less than 100{\thinsp}million years later.},

  title       = {A Theory for the Variation of Dust Attenuation Laws in Galaxies},
  abstract    = {In this paper, we provide a physical model for the origin of variations in the shapes and bump strengths of dust attenuation laws in galaxies by combining a large suite of cosmological "zoom-in" galaxy formation simulations with 3D Monte Carlo dust radiative transfer calculations. We model galaxies over 3 orders of magnitude in stellar mass, ranging from Milky Way like systems through massive galaxies at high-redshift. Critically, for these calculations we employ a constant underlying dust extinction law in all cases, and examine how the role of geometry and radiative transfer effects impact the resultant attenuation curves. Our main results follow. Despite our usage of a constant dust extinction curve, we find dramatic variations in the derived attenuation laws. The slopes of normalized attenuation laws depend primarily on the complexities of star-dust geometry. Increasing fractions of unobscured young stars flatten normalized curves, while increasing fractions of unobscured old stars steepen curves. Similar to the slopes of our model attenuation laws, we find dramatic variation in the 2175 Angstrom ultraviolet (UV) bump strength, including a subset of curves with little to no bump. These bump strengths are primarily influenced by the fraction of unobscured O and B stars in our model, with the impact of scattered light having only a secondary effect. Taken together, these results lead to a natural relationship between the attenuation curve slope and 2175 Angstrom bump strength. Finally, we apply these results to a 25 Mpc/h box cosmological hydrodynamic simulation in order to model the expected dispersion in attenuation laws at integer redshifts from z=0-6. A significant dispersion is expected at low redshifts, and decreases toward z=6. We provide tabulated results for the best fit median attenuation curve at all redshifts.},

  month         = may,
  abstract      = {In previous contributions, we have presented an analytical model describing the evolution of molecular clouds (MCs) undergoing global and hierarchical collapse. Here, we show that it can be used to estimate the ages of MCs for which pairs of parameters are known. The model cloud evolution is characterized by an initial increase in its mass, density, and star formation rate (SFR) and efficiency (SFE) as it contracts gravitationally, followed by a decrease of these quantities as newly formed massive stars begin to disrupt the cloud. The main controlling parameter of the model is the maximum mass reached by the cloud during its evolution. Thus, specifying the instantaneous mass and some other variable completely determines the cloud's evolutionary stage. We apply this capability of the model to interpret the observed scatter in SFEs of the cloud sample compiled by Lada et al. as an evolutionary effect. The model predicts that, although clouds such as California and Orion A have similar masses, they are in different evolutionary stages, causing them to have different SFRs and SFEs. Furthermore, the model predicts that the California cloud will eventually reach a significantly larger total mass than the Orion A cloud. Next, we apply the model to provide estimated ages of the clouds since the time when approximately 25$\backslash$\% of their mass had become molecular. We find ages ranging from $\sim 1.5$ to 27 Myr, with the most inactive clouds being the youngest. Another prediction is that clouds with low SFEs should have massive atomic envelopes that constitute the majority of their gravitational mass. Finally, we discuss the model prediction that low-mass clouds ($M \sim 10^3-10^4 M\_\odot$) end their lives with a mini-burst of star formation, reaching SFRs $\sim 300-500\, M\_\odot$ Myr$^{-1}$, at which time they have contracted to become compact massive star-forming clumps, embedded within larger GMCs.},

Far-infrared lines can be used to probe the structure and kinematics of such high-redshift galaxies as well as to accurately determine their spectroscopic redshifts. We use a cosmological simulation of galaxy formation to study the physical properties of [OIII] 88 $\backslash$mu m emitters. In a comoving volume of 50 $h^{-1}$ Mpc on a side, we locate 34 galaxies with stellar masses greater than $10^8\ {\rm M\_\odot}$ at $z = 9$, and more than 270 such galaxies at $z = 7$. We calculate the [OIII] 88 $\backslash$mu m luminosities ($L\_{\rm OIII}$) by combining a physical model of HII regions with emission line calculations using the photoionization code CLOUDY. We show that the resulting $L\_{\rm OIII}$, for a given star formation rate, is slightly higher than predicted from the empirical relation for local galaxies, and is consistent with recent observations of galaxies at redshifts 7 - 9. Bright [OIII] emitters with $L\_{\rm OIII} \gt 10^8 {\rm L\_\odot}$ have stellar masses greater than $10^9\ {\rm M\_\odot}$, star formation rates higher than $3\ {\rm M\_\odot\ yr}^{-1}$, and the typical metallicity is $\sim 0.1\ {\rm Z\_\odot}$. The galaxies are hosted by dark matter halos with masses greater than $10^{10.5}\ {\rm M\_\odot}$. Massive galaxies show characteristic structure where the [OIII] emitting gas largely overlaps with young stars, but the emission peak is separated from the main stellar population, suggesting the stochastic and localized nature of star formation in the first galaxies. We propose to use the [OIII] 5007 $\backslash$AA$\backslash$ line, to be detected by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), to study the properties of galaxies whose [OIII] 88 $\backslash$mu m line emission has been already detected with ALMA.},

We find that with increasing stellar mass M both the normalization and strength of the gradient in dust attenuation increases. Galaxies with a mean mass of $\langle \mathrm{log}\;M\rangle =9.2$M⊙ have little dust attenuation at all radii, whereas galaxies with $\langle \mathrm{log}\;M\rangle =10.2$M⊙ have AHα ≈ 2 mag in their central regions.

This expression can be used to correct spatially resolved measurements of Hα to radial distributions of star formation. When applied to our data, we find that the star formation rates (SFRs) in the central r < 1 kpc of galaxies in the highest mass bin are ~6 M⊙ yr−1, six times higher than before correction and approximately half of the total SFR of these galaxies. If this high central SFR is maintained for several Gyr, a large fraction of the stars in present-day bulges likely formed in situ.},

  title       = {First gas-phase metallicity gradients of $0.1 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.8$ galaxies with MUSE},
  abstract    = {Galaxies at low-redshift typically possess negative gas-phase metallicity gradients (centres more metal-rich than their outskirts). Whereas, it is not uncommon to observe positive metallicity gradients in higher-redshift galaxies ($z \gtrsim 0.6$). Bridging these epochs, we present gas-phase metallicity gradients of 84 star-forming galaxies between $0.08 < z < 0.84$. Using the galaxies with reliably determined metallicity gradients, we measure the median metallicity gradient to be negative ($-0.039^{+0.007}_{-0.009}$ dex/kpc). Underlying this, however, is significant scatter: $(8\pm3)\%\ [7]$ of galaxies have significantly positive metallicity gradients, $(38 \pm 5)\%\ [32]$ have significantly negative gradients, $(31\pm5)\%\ [26]$ have gradients consistent with being flat. (The remaining $(23\pm5)\%\ [19]$ have unreliable gradient estimates.) We notice a slight trend for a more negative metallicity gradient with both increasing stellar mass and increasing star formation rate (SFR). However, given the potential redshift and size selection effects, we do not consider these trends to be significant. Indeed, once we normalize the SFR relative to that of the main sequence, we do not observe any trend between the metallicity gradient and the normalized SFR. This is contrary to recent studies of galaxies at similar and higher redshifts. We do, however, identify a novel trend between the metallicity gradient of a galaxy and its size. Small galaxies ($r_d < 3$ kpc) present a large spread in observed metallicity gradients (both negative and positive gradients). In contrast, we find no large galaxies ($r_d > 3$ kpc) with positive metallicity gradients, and overall there is less scatter in the metallicity gradient amongst the large galaxies. These large (well-evolved) galaxies may be analogues of present-day galaxies, which also show a common negative metallicity gradient.},

  title       = {An Approach to Estimate the Binding energy of Interstellar Species},
  abstract    = {One of the major obstacles to accurately model the interstellar chemistry is an inadequate knowledge about the binding energy (BE) of interstellar species with dust grains. In denser region of molecular cloud, where very complex chemistry is active, interstellar dust is predominantly covered by H2O molecules and thus it is essential to know the interaction of gas phase species with water ice to trace realistic physical and chemical processes. To this effect, we consider water (cluster) ice to calculate the BE of several atoms, molecules, and radicals of astrochemical interest. Systematic studies have been carried out to come up with a relatively more accurate BE of astrophysically relevant species on water ice. We increase the size of the water cluster methodically to capture the realistic situation. Sequentially one, three, four, five and six water molecules are considered to represent water ice analogue in increasing order of complexity. We notice that for most of the species considered here, as we increase the cluster size, our calculated BE value starts to converge towards the experimentally obtained value. More specifically, our computed results with water c-pentamer (average deviation from experiment ~ 15.8%) and c-hexamer (chair) (average deviation from experiment ~ 16.7%) configuration are found to be more nearer as the experimentally obtained value than other water clusters considered.},

  abstract    = {The 21-cm signal in the vicinity of the first stars is expected to reflect properties of the first stars. In this study we pay special attention to tracing the time evolution of the ionizing photons' escape fraction, which affects the distribution of neutral hydrogen, by performing radiation hydrodynamics (RHD) simulations resolving dense gas in a halo. We find that the radial profile of 21-cm differential brightness temperature is quite sensitive to the stellar and halo masses, which reflects the time evolution of the escape fraction. In the case of a less massive star, ionizing photons hardly escape from its host halo due to the absorption by dense halo gas, thus an deep 21-cm absorption feature at just outside the halo lasts a long time. Whereas photons from a massive star well working to heat the ambient intergalactic medium turn out to cause a spatially extended 21-cm emission signature. Although individual signals are found to be undetectable with the Square Kilometre Array, our analysis using the results from the RHD simulations indicates that the properties of the first stars are imprinted on the 21-cm global signal: its amplitude depends not only on the cosmic star formation rate density, but also on the typical mass of the first stars due to the stellar-mass-dependent heating rate. Thus, we suggest that the initial mass function of the first stars is an essential factor in understanding the global signal.},

The tidal coherence of a galaxy environment is estimated as the cosine of the angle between two minor eigenvectors of the tidal field smoothed at the scales of $2$ and $30\,h^{-1}$Mpc centered on each of the local galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Data Release 10. Creating four luminosity-selected samples of the Sloan galaxies, we control them to have identical density distributions, in order to nullify the dominant effect of the local density. It is found that the samples containing more luminous wall and field galaxies yield lower mean values of the tidal coherence, which trend turns out to be robust against the variation of the smoothing scales. At fixed morphology, the same trend is found for the late-type spiral and lenticular galaxies in both of the field and wall environments. The early-type spiral field galaxies show no significant dependence on the tidal coherence, while both of the least and most luminous elliptical wall galaxies are found to dwell in the regions with highest tidal coherence.},

  abstract    = {The spiral waves detected in the protostellar disc surrounding Elias 2-27 have been suggested as evidence of the disc being gravitationally unstable. However, previous work has shown that a massive, stable disc undergoing an encounter with a massive companion are also consistent with the observations. We compare the spiral morphology of smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations modelling both cases. The gravitationally unstable disc produces symmetric, tightly wound spiral arms with constant pitch angle, as predicted by the literature. The companion disc's arms are asymmetric, with pitch angles that increase with radius. However, these arms are not well-fitted by standard analytic expressions, due to the high disc mass and relatively low companion mass. We note that differences (or indeed similarities) in morphology between pairs of spirals is a crucial discriminant between scenarios for Elias 2-27, and hence future studies must fit spiral arms individually. If Elias 2-27 continues to show symmetric tightly wound spiral arms in future observations, then we posit that it is the first observed example of a gravitationally unstable protostellar disc.},

Such strong magnetic fields prevent the formation of stars because patches of the interstellar medium are magnetically subcritical. Here we present the results from global numerical simulations of strongly magnetised and self-gravitating galactic discs, which show that the buoyancy of the magnetic field due to the Parker instability leads at first to the formation of giant filamentary regions. These filamentary structures become gravitationally unstable and fragment into $\sim10^5 M_{\odot}$ clouds that attract kpc long, coherent filamentary flows that build them into GMCs. Our results thus provide a solution to the long-standing problem of how the transition from sub- to supercritical regions in the interstellar medium proceeds.},

As a consequence, stars stripped from a satellite obtain a range of values for $\Omega_z$ and hence of frequency ratios, such that they spread into two dimensions, forming a ribbon-like structure with vertical extent comparable to that of the progenitor orbit. This has implications for the detectability of and search for tidal debris from Galactic satellites on disc orbits.},

  abstract    = {We study the direct gas-phase oxygen abundance using the well-detected auroral [OIII]4363 line in the stacked spectra of a sample of local analogs of high-redshift galaxies. These local analogs share the same location as $z\sim2$ star-forming galaxies on the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagram. This type of analog has the same ionized interstellar medium (ISM) properties as high-redshift galaxies. We establish empirical metallicity calibrations between the direct gas-phase oxygen abundances ($7.8<12+\log(\rm{O/H})<8.4$) and the N2/O3N2 indices in our local analogs. We find significant systematic offsets between the metallicity calibrations for our local analogs of high-redshift galaxies and those derived from the local HII regions and a sample of local reference galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The N2 and O3N2 metallicities will be underestimated by 0.05-0.1~dex relative to our calibration if one simply applies the local metallicity calibration in previous studies to high-redshift galaxies. Local metallicity calibrations also cause discrepancies of metallicity measurements in high-redshift galaxies using the N2 and O3N2 indicators. In contrast, our new calibrations produce consistent metallicities between these two indicators. We also derive metallicity calibrations for R23, O32, log([OIII]/H\beta), and log([NeIII]/[OII]) indices in our local analogs, which show significant offset compared to those in the SDSS reference galaxies. By comparing with MAPPINGS photoionization models, the different empirical metallicity calibration relations in the local analogs and the SDSS reference galaxies can be shown to be primarily due to the change of ionized ISM conditions.},

  abstract    = {Using a sample of nearly half a million galaxies, intersected by over 8 million lines of sight from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 12, we extend our previous study of the recombination radiation emitted by the gaseous halos of nearby galaxies. We identify an inflection in the radial profile of the H$\alpha$+N[{\small II}] radial emission profile at a projected radius of $\sim 50$ kpc and suggest that beyond this radius the emission from ionized gas in spatially correlated halos dominates the profile. We confirm that this is a viable hypothesis using results from a highly simplified theoretical treatment in which the dark matter halo distribution from cosmological simulations is straightforwardly populated with gas. Whether we fit the fraction of halo gas in a cooler (T $= 12,000$ K), smooth ($c = 1$) component (0.26 for galaxies with M$_* = 10^{10.88}$ M$_\odot$ and 0.34 for those with M$_* = 10^{10.18}$ M$_\odot$) or take independent values of this fraction from published hydrodynamical simulations (0.19 and 0.38, respectively), this model successfully reproduces the radial location and amplitude of the observed inflection. We also observe that the physical nature of the gaseous halo connects to primary galaxy morphology beyond any relationship to the galaxy's stellar mass and star formation rate. We explore whether the model reproduces behavior related to the central galaxy's stellar mass, star formation rate, and morphology. We find that it is unsuccessful in reproducing the observations at this level of detail and discuss various shortcomings of our simple model that may be responsible.},

The bias is more pronounced for diffuse emission. The visibility based power spectrum estimator, however, gives an unbiased estimate of the true power spectrum.

  abstract    = {We investigate the impact of cosmic rays (CRs) on galactic outflows from a multi-phase interstellar medium with solar neighbourhood conditions. The three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamical simulations include CRs as a relativistic fluid in the advection-diffusion approximation. The thermal and chemical state of the ISM is computed with a non-equilibrium chemical network. We find that CRs (injected with 10 \% of the supernova energy) efficiently support the launching of outflows and strongly affect their phase structure. Outflows leaving the midplane are denser ($\rho \sim 10^{-26}\,\mathrm{g\,cm}^{-3}$), colder ($\sim 10^4\,\mathrm{K}$), and slower ($\sim 30\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$) if CRs are considered in addition to thermal SNe. The CR supported outflows are also smoother, in particular at larger heights ($> 1\,\mathrm{kpc}$ above the midplane) without the direct impact of SN explosions. Approximately $5\% - 25\%$ of the injected CR energy is lost via hadronic cooling. Smaller diffusion coefficients lead to slightly larger hadronic losses but allow for steeper CR pressure gradients, stronger outflows and larger accelerations. Up to a height of $z \sim1\,\mathrm{kpc}$ there are large volumes in approximate pressure equilibrium between thermal and CR component. At larger altitudes the CR pressure is $10-100$ times as large as the thermal counterpart. More than $\sim 1\,\mathrm{kpc}$ away from the midplane, CRs provide the dominant gas acceleration mechanism.},

ALMA observations of the dust continuum in the COSMOS field are used to estimate molecular gas masses at $z$ $\approx$ 0.5-3.5. We also use a local universe sample from the ALFALFA HI survey after converting it to molecular masses. The molecular mass ($M_{ISM}$) scaling relation shows a dependence on $z$, $M_{*}$, and sSFR relative to the MS, but no dependence on environmental overdensity $\Delta$ ($M_{ISM}$ $\propto$ $\Delta^{0.03}$). Similarly, gas mass fraction (f$_{gas}$) and depletion timescale ($\tau$) show no environmental dependence to $z$ $\sim$ 3.5. At $\langle z\rangle$ $\sim$ 1.8, the average $\langle M_{ISM}\rangle$,$\langle$f$_{gas}\rangle$, and $\langle \tau \rangle$ in densest regions is (1.6$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^{11}$ $M_{\odot}$, 55$\pm$2%, and 0.8$\pm$0.1 Gyr, respectively, similar to those in the lowest density bin. Independent of the environment, f$_{gas}$ decreases and $\tau$ increases with increasing cosmic time. Cosmic molecular mass density ($\rho$) in the lowest density bins peaks at $z$ $\sim$ 1-2 and this peak happens at $z$ $<$ 1 in densest bins. This differential evolution of $\rho$ across environments is likely due to the growth of the large-scale structure with cosmic time. Our results suggest that the molecular gas content and the subsequent star-formation activity of log($M_{*}$/$M_{\odot}$) $\gtrsim$ 10 star-forming and starburst galaxies is primarily driven by internal processes, not their local environment since $z$ $\sim$ 3.5},

We use the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to measure $\sim$15 Hn$\alpha$ recombination transitions simultaneously and average these data to improve our spectral signal-to-noise ratio. We show that our data can be used to estimate the total ionizing photon flux of these two sources, and we derive their SFRs within the GBT beam: $\Psi\_{\rm OB} = 3.46$ M$\_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for M51 and $\Psi\_{\rm OB} = 0.56$ M$\_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for NGC628. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to detect RRLs from normal galaxies that are not undergoing a starburst with current instrumentation and reasonable integration times ($\sim$12 hr for each source). We also show that we can characterize the overall star-forming properties of M51 and NGC628, although the GBT beam cannot resolve individual HII region complexes. Our results suggest that future instruments, such as the Square Kilometre Array and the Next Generation Very Large Array, will be able to detect RRL emission from a multitude of Milky Way-like galaxies, making it possible to determine SFRs of normal galaxies unaffected by extinction and to measure global star formation properties in the local universe.},

  abstract      = {Aiming to characterise the properties of the molecular gas in the ultraluminous infrared galaxy Mrk273 and its outflow, we used the NOEMA interferometer to image the dense gas molecular tracers HCN, HCO+, HNC, HOC+ and HC3N at 86GHz and 256GHz with angular resolutions of 4.9x4.5 arcsec (3.7x3.4 kpc) and 0.61x0.55 arcsec (460x420 pc). We also modelled the flux of several H2O lines observed with Herschel using a radiative transfer code that includes excitation by collisions as well as by far-infrared photons. The disk of the Mrk273 north nucleus has two components with decoupled kinematics. The gas in the outer parts (1.5 kpc) rotates with a south-east to north-west direction, while in the inner disk (300 pc) follows a north-east to south-west rotation. The central 300 pc, which hosts a compact starburst region, is filled with dense and warm gas, contains a dynamical mass of (4-5)x10\^{}9M\_sun, a luminosity of L'\_HCN=(3-4)x10\^{}8 K km/s pc\^{}2, and a dust temperature of 55 K. At the very centre, a compact core with R\~{}50 pc has a luminosity of L\_IR=4x10\^{}11L\_sun (30\% of the total infrared luminosity), and a dust temperature of 95 K. The core is expanding at low velocities \~{}50-100 km/s, probably affected by the outflowing gas. We detect the blue-shifted component of the outflow, while the red-shifted counterpart remains undetected in our data. Its cold and dense phase reaches fast velocities up to \~{}1000 km/s, while the warm outflowing gas has more moderate maximum velocities of \~{}600 km/s. The outflow is detected as far as 460 pc from the centre in the northern direction, and has a mass of dense gas $\lt$8x10\^{}8M\_sun. The difference between the position angles of the inner disk (\~{}70 degree) and the outflow (\~{}10 degree) indicates that the outflow is likely powered by the AGN, and not by the starburst. Regarding the chemistry, we measure an extremely low HCO+/HOC+ ratio of 10+-5 in the inner disk of Mrk273.},

  title       = {Resolved Star Formation Efficiency in the Antennae Galaxies},
  abstract    = {We use Atacama Large Millimeter Array CO(3-2) observations in conjunction with optical observations from the Hubble Space Telescope to determine the ratio of stellar to gas mass for regions in the Antennae Galaxies. We adopt the term "instantaneous mass ratio" IMR(t) = M$_{stars}$/(M$_{gas}$ +M$_{stars}$), that is equivalent to the star formation efficiency for an idealized system at t = 0. We use two complementary approaches to determining the IMR(t) based on 1) the enclosed stellar and molecular mass within circular apertures centered on optically-identified clusters, and 2) a tessellation algorithm that defines regions based on CO emission. We find that only a small number of clusters appear to have IMR(0) = SFE > 0.2, which suggests that only a small fraction of these clusters will remain bound. The results suggest that by ages of $10^{6.7}$ years, some clusters will have lost all of their associated molecular gas, and by $10^{7.5}$ years this is true for the majority of clusters. There appears to be slight dependence of the IMR(t) on the CO surface brightness, which could support the idea that dense molecular environments are more likely to form bound clusters. However, the IMR(t) appears to have a strong dependence on extinction, which likely traces the evolutionary state of clusters.},

We examine the number of spiral arms, their relative pitch angle, and the presence of a galactic bar in the disc, and show that both the slope and dispersion of the M$_{⋆}$-SFR relation is constant when varying all the above parameters. We also show that mergers (both major and minor), which represent the strongest conditions for increases in star formation at a constant mass, only boost the SFR above the main relation by {\tilde}0.3 dex; this is significantly smaller than the increase seen in merging systems at z $\gt$ 1. Of the galaxies lying significantly above the M$_{⋆}$-SFR relation in the local Universe, more than 50 per cent are mergers. We interpret this as evidence that the spiral arms, which are imperfect reflections of the galaxy's current gravitational potential, are either fully independent of the various quenching mechanisms or are completely overwhelmed by the combination of outflows and feedback. The arrangement of the star formation can be changed, but the system as a whole regulates itself even in the presence of strong dynamical forcing.},

The SFRs are estimated from H{$\alpha$} in combination with 22 {$\mu$}m observation from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer.

We confirm that the dispersion increases with M* from 0.37 {\plusmn} 0.01 dex at $\{$log$\}$(M*/$\{$M$\}$$_{⊙ }$)$\backslash$lt 9.6 to 0.51 {\plusmn} 0.02 dex at $\{$log$\}$(M*/$\{$M$\}$$_{⊙ }$) $\backslash$gt  10.2. Despite star formation being mostly associated with disks, the dispersion of disk sSFR still increases with M*. We conclude that the presence of bulges/bars is likely responsible for the large dispersion of sSFR in massive SFGs, while low-mass SFGs are mostly disk dominated and thus have a small dispersion. Our results suggest that star formation on galactic scales is dramatically affected by central dense structures through both enhancing and/or quenching processes, while lower-mass SFGs tend to have less bursty SFHs. However, the dispersion of the sSFR becomes significantly smaller and remains constant when only disk-dominated SFGs are counted. This finding implies that the impact of stochastic stellar feedback on star formation is likely to follow the same pattern in all disk galaxies, showing no correlation with halo potential.},

Using local galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we have classified galaxies according to their emission line ratios, and studied their location on the star formation rate-stellar mass plane. We find that galaxies form a sequence from the `blue cloud' galaxies which are actively forming stars, through a combination of composite, Seyfert, and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region galaxies, ending as `red-and-dead' galaxies. The sequence supports an evolutionary pathway for galaxies in which star formation quenching by active galactic nuclei plays a key role.},

  abstract = {Aims:We study the relationship between the local environment of galaxies and their star formation rate (SFR) in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey, GOODS, at z{\tilde}1.   <BR />Methods: We use ultradeep imaging at 24 {$\mu$}m with the MIPS camera onboard $\{$Spitzer$\}$ to determine the contribution of obscured light to the SFR of galaxies over the redshift range 0.8{\le} z {\le}1.2. Accurate galaxy densities are measured thanks to the large sample of  1200 spectroscopic redshifts with high ( 70\%) spectroscopic completeness. Morphology and stellar masses are derived from deep HST-ACS imaging, supplemented by ground based imaging programs and photometry from the IRAC camera onboard $\{$Spitzer$\}$.   <BR />Results: We show that the star formation-density relation observed locally was reversed at z{\tilde} 1: the average SFR of an individual galaxy increased with local galaxy density when the universe was less than half its present age. Hierarchical galaxy formation models (simulated lightcones from the Millennium model) predicted such a reversal to occur only at earlier epochs (z$\gt$2) and at a lower level. We present a remarkable structure at z{\tilde} 1.016, containing X-ray traced galaxy concentrations, which will eventually merge into a Virgo-like cluster. This structure illustrates how the individual SFR of galaxies increases with density and shows that it is the  1-2 Mpc scale that affects most the star formation in galaxies at z{\tilde}1. The SFR of z{\tilde}1 galaxies is found to correlate with stellar mass suggesting that mass plays a role in the observed star formation-density trend. However the specific SFR (=SFR/M$_{star}$) decreases with stellar mass while it increases with galaxy density, which implies that the environment does directly affect the star formation activity of galaxies. Major mergers do not appear to be the unique or even major cause for this effect since nearly half (46\%) of the luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) at z{\tilde} 1 present the HST-ACS morphology of spirals, while only a third present a clear signature of major mergers. The remaining galaxies are divided into compact (9\%) and irregular (14\%) galaxies. Moreover, the specific SFR of major mergers is only marginally stronger than that of spirals.   <BR />Conclusions: These findings constrain the influence of the growth of large-scale structures on the star formation history of galaxies. Reproducing the SFR-density relation at z{\tilde}1 is a new challenge for models, requiring a correct balance between mass assembly through mergers and in-situ star formation at early epochs.},

They have unveiled a range of atypical kinematic phenomena, which require detailed modelling to understand. We present results from a cosmological simulation that includes stellar and AGN feedback. We find that the distribution of angles between the gas and stellar angular momenta of galaxies is not affected by projection effects. We examine five galaxies ($\approx 6$ per cent of well resolved galaxies) that display atypical kinematics; two of the galaxies have kinematically distinct cores (KDC), while the other three have counter-rotating gas and stars. All five form the majority of their stars in the field, subsequently falling into cosmological filaments where the relative orientation of the stellar angular momentum and the bulk gas flow leads to the formation of a counter-rotating gas disc. The accreted gas exchanges angular momentum with pre-existing co-rotating gas causing it to fall to the centre of the galaxy. This triggers low-level AGN feedback, which reduces star formation. Later, two of the galaxies experience a minor merger (stellar mass ratio $\sim1/10$) with a galaxy on a retrograde orbit compared to the spin of the stellar component of the primary. This produces the KDCs, and is a different mechanism than suggested by other works. The role of minor mergers in the kinematic evolution of galaxies may have been under-appreciated in the past, and large, high-resolution cosmological simulations will be necessary to gain a better understanding in this area.},

We used up to nine flux points (BVRIZYJHKs magnitudes), its errors and redshifts to compute M$\_{\rm{star}}$, SFR and sSFR through spectral energy distribution fitting technique. We use a z-dependent sSFR value to distinguish star-forming (SF) from quiescent galaxies. To analyse the SFR and sSFR history we split our sample in two redshift bins: galaxies at $0.4 \lt z \lt 0.6$ and $0.6 \lt z \lt 0.9$. We separate the effects of environment and stellar mass on galaxies by comparing the properties of star-forming and quiescent galaxies at fixed environment (projected radius) and fixed stellar mass. For the selected spectroscopic sample of more than 500 galaxies, the well-known correlation between SFR and $M\_{\rm star}$ is already in place at $z \sim 0.9$, for both SF and quenched galaxies. Our results are consistent with no evidence that SFR (or sSFR) depends on environment, suggesting that for cluster galaxies at an intermediate-to-high redshift range, mass is the primary characteristic that drives SFR.},

The measured column density is $N$(OH) = (6.3$\pm$0.8)$\times$10$^{13}$($\frac{T\_{\rm ex}}{3.5}$)($\frac{1.0}{f\_c^{\rm OH}}$) cm$^{-2}$, where $f\_c^{\rm OH}$ and $T\_{\rm ex}$ are the covering factor and the excitation temperature of the absorbing gas, respectively. In our Galaxy, the column densities of OH in diffuse clouds are of the order of $N$(OH)$\sim$10$^{13-14}$ cm$^{-2}$. From the incidence (number per unit redshift; $n\_{21}$) of HI 21-cm absorbers at $0.5\ltz\lt1$ and assuming no redshift evolution, we estimate the incidence of OH absorbers (with log$N$(OH)$\gt$13.6) to be $n\_{\rm OH}$ = $0.008^{+0.018}\_{-0.008}$ at $z\sim0.1$. Based on this we expect to detect 10$^{+20}\_{-10}$ such OH absorbers from the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey. Using HI 21-cm and OH 1667 MHz absorption lines detected towards Q0248+430, we estimate ($\Delta F/F$) = (5.2$\pm$4.5)$\times 10^{-6}$, where $F \equiv g\_p (\alpha^2/\mu)^{1.57}$, $\alpha$ $-$ the fine structure constant, $\mu$ $-$ the electron-proton mass ratio and $g\_p$ $-$ the proton gyromagnetic ratio.

We trace the total gas using a combination of the 21cm HI line for atomic hydrogen, and CO($\textit{J}$=2-1) data for molecular hydrogen. We have also traced the total gas using dust masses. We study the star-formation law in terms of molecular gas, total gas, and gas from dust. We perform an analysis of the star-formation law on a variety of pixel scales, from 25$^{\prime\prime}$ to 500$^{\prime\prime}$ (100pc to 2kpc). At kpc scales, we find that a linear Schmidt-type power law index is suitable for molecular gas, but the index appears to be much higher with total gas, and gas from dust.

In this paper, the role of Interstellar Radiation Field (ISRF) on ices in Elias 29 is addressed. This object is the most luminous protostar in $\rho$ Oph E molecular cloud, and is surrounded by many Young Stellar Objects distant only a few arcminutes. In addition, other two brightness BV stars (S1 and HD 147889) enhance the external irradiation in Elias 29. This study was carried out by using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC-3D assuming an internal and external irradiation. As result, we found that HD 147889 dominates the ISRF, instead of the closest protostars, and contributes to enhance the external irradiation in 44 times the standard value. Furthermore, remarkable effects are observed in FIR spectrum, as well as in near-IR image. Additionally, the snowline positions of volatile compounds, such as CO, O$\_2$, N$\_2$ and CH$\_4$ are redefined to a toroidal-shaped morphology in the envelope, with low FUV flux (10$^{-7}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$). In such scenario, the formation of complex molecules as result of hydrogenation or oxygenation of volatile species are expected to be severely affected.},

We select data homogeneously from recent data sets, including PNe at large Galactocentric distances. The radial oxygen gradient calculated for the general PN population, which probes the region between the Galactic center and out to $\sim$28 kpc, is shallow, with slope $\sim$-0.02 dex kpc$^{-1}$, in agreement with previous findings. We looked for time evolution of the metallicity gradient using PNe with different age progenitors as metallicity probes. We identify PNe whose progenitor stars are younger than 1 Gyr (YPPNe), and those whose progenitor stars are older than 7.5 Gyr (OPPNe), based on the comparison between evolutionary yields and elemental abundances of the PNe. By studying OPPNe and YPPNe separately we found that: (i) The OPPNe oxygen gradient is shallower ($\sim-0.015$ dex kpc$^{-1}$) than that derived from YPPNe ($\sim-0.027$ dex kpc$^{-1}$); (ii) the OPPNe inner radial distribution of oxygen is compatible with no gradient to the radial extent of the thick disk population ($\sim$10 kpc), similarly to what has been observed in thick disk stars; (iii) planetary nebulae (especially OPPNe) indicate that significant gradient slope is limited to Galactocentric distances between $\sim$10 to $\sim$13.5 kpc, as observed for open clusters and field stars. Outside this range, the distribution is almost flat. We found that the radial oxygen gradient is steeper for a PN population closer to the Galactic disk, similarly to what is observed in the general stellar population by the SEGUE survey. We use our novel population dating to compare our results with current chemical evolutionary models, and with gradients from other Galactic populations, for insight on galaxy chemical evolution.},

The variations of absorption lines are inversely correlated with the changes in the ionizing continuum. We also find that large variations of C IV narrow absorption lines are difficult to form on a short timescale.},

H-ATLAS $J084933.4+021443$, a $z=2.41$ binary HyLIRG with at least two additional luminous companion galaxies, is thus an optimal test-ground for studies of star formation and galaxy evolution during ``cosmic noon''. We have used ALMA to obtain resolved imaging and kinematics of atomic and molecular emission lines, and rest-frame $340$ to $1160$GHz continuum emission, for the known luminous component galaxies in H-ATLAS $J084933.4+021443$: W, T, M, C. All four component galaxies are spatially ($\sim 0 .\!\!^{''} 3$ or $2.5$kpc) resolved in CO J:7-6, [C$\_\mathrm{I}$] 2-1, H$\_2$O and the millimetre (mm) to sub-mm continuum. Rotation-dominated gas kinematics is confirmed in W and T. The significant extension to component T, in gas and continuum, along its kinematic minor axis, is attributable to its lensing magnification. Spatially resolved sub-mm spectral energy distributions reveal that component W is well fit with greybody emission from dust at a single temperature over the full extent of the galaxy, despite it containing a powerful AGN, while component T requires an additional component of hotter nuclear dust and additional sources of emission in the mm. We confirm that [C$\_\mathrm{I}$] 2-1 can be used as a rough tracer of warm/dense molecular gas in extreme systems, though the [C$\_\mathrm{I}$] 2-1/CO luminosity ratio increases sub-linearly. We obtain an exquisite and unprecedented resolved ($2.5$-kpc-scale) ``warm/dense molecular gas'' Schmidt-Kennicutt (SK) relationship for components W and T. Gas exhaustion times for all apertures in W (T) are $1-4$Gyr ($0.5-2$Gyr). Both W and T follow a resolved ``warm/dense gas'' SK relationship with power law $n\sim1.7$, significantly steeper than the $n\sim1$ found previously via ``cold'' molecular gas in nearby ``normal'' star-forming galaxies.},

We derive the BLFs and BMFs from the K-band and stellar mass, far-infrared luminosities, star formation rate, dust and gas masses cumulative distributions using a copula method which is outlined in detail. The use of the bivariate computed taking into account the upper limits allows us to derive on a more solid statistical ground the relationship between the observed physical quantities. The analysis shows that the behaviour of the morphological (optically selected) subsamples is quite different. A statistically meaningful result can be obtained over the whole HRS sample only from the relationship between the K-band and the stellar mass, while for the remaining physical quantities (dust and gas masses, far-IR luminosity and star formation rate), the analysis is distinct for late-type (LT) and early-type galaxies (ETG). However, the number of ETGs is small to perform a robust statistical analysis, and in most of the case results are discussed only for the LTG subsample. The Luminosity and Mass Functions (LFs, MFs) of LTGs are generally dependent on the K-band and the various dependencies are discussed in detail. We are able to derive the corresponding LFs and MFs and compare them with those computed with other samples. Our statistical analysis allows us to characterise the HRS, that, although non homogeneously selected and partially biased towards low IR luminosities, may be considered as representative of the local LT galaxy population.},

In total we detect 63 sources, of which 50 have luminosity L$_X \geq 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$, classifying them as ultra luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). We find that the total XLF is not significantly different from XLFs derived for other kinds of galaxies, with a tendency of having a larger fraction of high X-ray luminosity objects. Both the total number of ULXs and the number of ULXs per unit star formation rate are found in the upper envelope of the more normal galaxies distribution. Further analysis would be needed to address the issue of the nature of the compact component in the binary system.},

  abstract      = {ALMA surveys of nearby star-forming regions have shown that the dust mass in the disk is correlated with the stellar mass, but with a large scatter. This scatter could indicate either different evolutionary paths of disks or different initial conditions within a single cluster. We present ALMA Cycle 3 follow-up observations for 14 Class II disks that were low S/N detections or non-detections in our Cycle 2 survey of the $\sim 2$ Myr-old Chamaeleon I star-forming region. With 5 times better sensitivity, we detect millimeter dust continuum emission from six more sources and increase the detection rate to 94$\backslash$\% (51/54) for Chamaeleon I disks around stars earlier than M3. The stellar-disk mass scaling relation reported in $\backslash$citet$\{$pascucci2016$\}$ is confirmed with these updated measurements. Faint outliers in the $F\_{mm}$--$M\_*$ plane include three non-detections (CHXR71, CHXR30A, and T54) with dust mass upper limits of 0.2 M$\_\oplus$ and three very faint disks (CHXR20, ISO91, and T51) with dust masses $\sim 0.5$ M$\_\oplus$. By investigating the SED morphology, accretion property and stellar multiplicity, we suggest for the three millimeter non-detections that tidal interaction by a close companion ($\lt$100 AU) and internal photoevaporation may play a role in hastening the overall disk evolution. The presence of a disk around only the secondary star in a binary system may explain the observed stellar SEDs and low disk masses for some systems.},

  abstract      = {For the first time both H$\alpha$ and far-ultraviolet (FUV) observations from an HI-selected sample are used to determine the dust-corrected star formation rate density (SFRD: $\dot{\rho}$) in the local Universe. Applying the two star formation rate indicators on 294 local galaxies we determine log($\dot{\rho}$$ \_{H\alpha}) = -1.68~^{+0.13}\_{-0.05}$ [M$\_{\odot} $ yr$^{-1} $ Mpc$^{-3}]$ and log($\dot{\rho}\_{FUV}$) $ = -1.71~^{+0.12}\_{-0.13}$ [M$\_\odot $ yr$^{-1} $ Mpc$^{-3}]$. These values are derived from scaling H$\alpha$ and FUV observations to the HI mass function. Galaxies were selected to uniformly sample the full HI mass (M$\_{HI}$) range of the HI Parkes All-Sky Survey (M$\_{HI} \sim10^{7}$ to $\sim10^{10.7}$ M$\_{\odot}$). The approach leads to relatively larger sampling of dwarf galaxies compared to optically-selected surveys. The low HI mass, low luminosity and low surface brightness galaxy populations have, on average, lower H$\alpha$/FUV flux ratios than the remaining galaxy populations, consistent with the earlier results of Meurer. The near-identical H$\alpha$- and FUV-derived SFRD values arise with the low H$\alpha$/FUV flux ratios of some galaxies being offset by enhanced H$\alpha$ from the brightest and high mass galaxy populations. Our findings confirm the necessity to fully sample the HI mass range for a complete census of local star formation to include lower stellar mass galaxies which dominate the local Universe.},

  abstract      = {The Carnegie-Irvine Galaxy Survey provides high-quality broad-band optical images of a large sample of nearby galaxies for detailed study of their structure. To probe the physical nature and possible cosmological evolution of spiral arms, a common feature of many disk galaxies, it is important to quantify their main characteristics. We describe robust methods to measure the number of arms, their mean strength, length, and pitch angle. The arm strength depends only weakly on the adopted radii over which it is measured, and it is stronger in bluer bands than redder bands. The vast majority of clearly two-armed (``grand-design'') spiral galaxies have systematically higher relative amplitude of the $m=2$ Fourier mode in the main spiral region. We use both one-dimensional and two-dimensional Fourier decomposition to measure the pitch angle, finding reasonable agreement between these two techniques with a scatter of $\sim$2$\deg$. To understand the applicability and limitations of our methodology to imaging surveys of local and distant galaxies, we create mock images with properties resembling observations of local ($z$ $\lesssim$ 0.1) galaxies by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and distant galaxies (0.1 $\lesssim$ $z$ $\lesssim$ 1.1) observed with the $Hubble$ $Space$ $Telescope$. These simulations lay the foundation for forthcoming quantitative statistical studies of spiral structure to understand its formation mechanism, dependence on galaxy properties, and cosmological evolution.},

The search for YSOs in the region using VISTA/VVV and Spitzer/GLIMPSE catalogs resulted in a total of 799 YSOs, with 66 Class I and 733 Class II YSOs. The search for near- and mid-infrared counterparts of the X-ray sources led to a total of 165 VISTA/VVV counterparts, and a total of 151 Spitzer/GLIMPSE counterparts. The infrared analysis of the X-ray counterparts allowed us to add an extra 123 YSOs associated with the region. We conclude that a total of 922 YSOs are associated with the region, with 67 Class I, 764 Class II, and 91 Class III YSOs. We also found that the region is composed of 11 subclusters. In the vicinity of the high-mass protostar, the stellar distribution has a core-halo structure. The subcluster containing the high-mass protostar is the densest and the youngest in the region, and the high-mass protostar is located at its center.

Our final sample includes 25 isolated, non-interacting star-forming galaxies with double-horned or boxy CO integrated line profiles located at redshifts z $\lt$= 0.3, drawn from a larger ensemble of 67 detected objects. The best reverse Ks-band, stellar mass and baryonic mass CO TFRs are respectively M\_Ks = (-8.4+/-2.9) [log(W\_50/sini)-2.5]+(-23.5 +/- 0.5), log (Mstar/Msun) =(5.2+/-3.0) [log(W\_50/sini)-2.59]+(10.1+/-0.5) and log (Mb/Msun) = (4.9+/-2.8) [log(W\_50/sini)-2.5]+(10.2+/-0.5), where M\_Ks is the total absolute Ks-band magnitude of the objects, Mstar and Mb their total stellar and baryonic masses, and W\_50 the width of their line profile at 50\% of the maximum. Dividing the sample into different redshift bins and comparing to the TFRs of a sample of local (z = 0) star-forming galaxies from the literature, we find no significant evolution in the slopes and zero-points of the TFRs since z = 0.3, this in either luminosity or mass. In agreement with a growing number of CO TFR studies of nearby galaxies, we more generally find that CO is a suitable and attractive alternative to neutral hydrogen (HI). Our work thus provides an important benchmark for future higher redshift CO TFR studies.},

We used multi-wavelength optical photometry and imaging at ground-based telescopes and archival imaging and spectroscopic UV data from the spaceborn GALEX and SPEAR/FIMS instruments. We used Monte Carlo RT and both observational data and synthetic models for the ISRF in the solar neighbourhood. The line-of-sight extinctions through the clouds have been determined using near infrared excesses of background stars and the 200/250um far infrared emission by dust measured using the ISO and Herschel space observatories. The optical surface brightness of the target clouds can be explained in terms of scattered light. The dust albedo ranges from 0.58 at 3500A to 0.72 at 7500A. The SED of LDN1780 is explained in terms of optical depth and background scattered light effects instead of ERE. The FUV surface brightness of LDN 1780 cannot be explained by scattered light only. In LDN1780 H2 fluorescent emission in the wavelength range 1400A-1700A has been detected and analysed. Our albedo values agree with the predictions of the dust model of Weingartner and Draine and with the THEMIS CMM model for evolved core-mantle grains. The H2 fluorescent emission in LDN1780 shows a pronounced dichotomy with a preference for its southern side where enhanced illumination impinges from the Sco OB2 association and the O star zeta Oph. A good correlation is found between the H2 fluorescence and a previously mapped 21-cm excess emission. The H2 fluorescence emission in LDN1780 has been modelled using a PDR code; the resulting values for H2 column density and the total gas density are consistent with the estimates derived from CO observations and optical extinction along the line of sight.},

  abstract      = {We use a hybrid observational/theoretical approach to study the relation between galaxy kinematics and the derived stellar and halo masses of galaxies up to z=3 as a function of stellar mass, redshift and morphology. Our observational sample consists of a concatenation of 1125 galaxies with kinematic measurements at 0.4$\lt$z$\lt$3 from long-slit and integral-field studies. We investigate several ways to measure halo masses from observations based on results from semi-analytical models, showing that galaxy halo masses can be retrieved with a scatter of \~{}0.4 dex by using only stellar masses. We discover a third parameter, relating to the time of the formation of the halo, which reduces the scatter in the relation between the stellar and halo masses, such that systems forming earlier have a higher stellar mass to halo mass ratio, which we also find observationally. We find that this scatter correlates with morphology, such that early-type, or older stellar systems, have higher M\_*/M\_halo ratios. We furthermore show using this approach, and through weak lensing and abundance matching, that the ratio of stellar to halo mass does not significantly evolve with redshift at 1$\lt$z$\lt$3. This is evidence for the regulated hierarchical assembly of galaxies such that the ratio of stellar to dark matter mass remains approximately constant since $z = 2$. We use these results to show that the dark matter accretion rate evolves from $dM\_{\rm halo}/d{\rm t} \sim 4000$ M\_solar year$^{-1}$ at $z \sim 2.5$, to a few 100 M\_solar year$^{-1}$ by $z \sim 0.5$.},

  abstract      = {We present a detailed spectral modelling of NGC4993 -- the host galaxy of GW170817 -- and other SGRB host galaxies. In order to determine their physical conditions and the element abundances, we have gathered spectroscopic and photometric data from the literature. The observation data are sometimes missing preventing us from fully constraining the model. However, for most of the SGRB hosts the [OIII]5007/Hb and [NII]6548/Ha line ratios are reported. The analysis of NGC4993 by a composite model (photoionization+shock) confirms that an AGN, most probably a LINER or a LLAGN, is the gas photoionization source. Shock velocities and preshock densities are similar to those found in the narrow line region of AGN. O/H and N/H have solar values. For the other SGRB of the sample we have found that O/H ratios are nearly solar, while N/H cover a much larger range of values at redshifts close to 0.4. In NGC4993, the relative contribution to the SED of an old stellar population, characterized by a black body temperature of Tbb=4000K, with respect to Bremsstrahlung is higher by a factor $\gt$100 than in most of the local AGN and SB galaxies. For the other SGRB composing the sample, Tbb ranges between 2000K for SGRB100206A and 8000K for SGRB111117A.},

  abstract      = {What role does Galactic structure play in star formation? We have used the Herschel Hi-GAL compact-clump catalogue to examine trends in evolutionary stage over large spatial scales in the inner Galaxy. We examine the relationship between the fraction of clumps with embedded star formation (the star-forming fraction, or SFF) and other measures of star-formation activity. Based on a positive correlation between SFF and evolutionary indicators such as the luminosity-to-mass ratio, we assert that the SFF principally traces the average evolutionary state of a sample and must depend on the local fraction of rapidly-evolving, high-mass young stellar objects. The spiral-arm tangent point longitudes show small excesses in the SFF, though these can be accounted for by a small number of the most massive clusters, just 7.6\% of the total number of clumps in the catalogue. This suggests that while the arms tend to be home to the Galaxy's massive clusters, the remaining 92.4\% of Hi-GAL clumps in our catalogue do not show an enhancement of star formation within arms. Globally, the SFF is highest at the Galactic midplane and inner longitudes. We find no significant trend in evolutionary stage as a function of position across spiral arms at the tangent-point longitudes. This indicates that the angular offset observed between gas and stars, if coordinated by a density wave, is not evident at the clump phase; alternatively, the onset of star formation is not triggered by the spiral density wave.},

  abstract      = {Star-forming clumps dominate the rest-frame ultraviolet morphology of galaxies at the peak of cosmic star formation. If turbulence driven fragmentation is the mechanism responsible for their formation, we expect their stellar mass function to follow a power-law of slope close to $-2$. We test this hypothesis performing the first analysis of the stellar mass function of clumps hosted in galaxies at $z\sim 1-3.5$. The clump sample is gathered from the literature with similar detection thresholds and stellar masses determined in a homogeneous way. To overcome the small number statistics per galaxy (each galaxy hosts up to a few tens of clumps only), we combine all high-redshift clumps. The resulting clump mass function follows a power-law of slope $\sim -1.7$ and flattens at masses below $2\times 10^7$ M$\_{\odot}$. By means of randomly sampled clump populations, drawn out of a power-law mass function of slope $-2$, we test the effect of combining small clump populations, detection limits of the surveys, and blending on the mass function. Our numerical exercise reproduces all the features observed in the real clump mass function confirming that it is consistent with a power-law of slope $\simeq -2$. This result supports the high-redshift clump formation through fragmentation in a similar fashion as in local galaxies, but under different gas conditions.},

Our observations reach the lowest stellar mass ever probed in a resolved galaxy, with 50$\backslash$\% completeness at $\sim 0.17$ M$\_{\odot}$. Unresolved background galaxies however limit our purity below $\sim 0.23$ M$\_{\odot}$. If modeled with a single power law, we find that the IMF slope is $-1.45^{+0.29}\_{-0.3}$ (68$\backslash$\% credible intervals), compared to a Milky Way value of $-2.3$. For a broken power law, we obtain a low-mass slope of $-1.18\_{-0.33}^{+0.49}$, a high-mass slope of $-1.88\_{-0.49}^{+0.43}$ and a break mass of $0.57\_{-0.08}^{+0.12}$ M$\_{\odot}$, compared to $-1.3$, $-2.3$ and 0.5 M$\_{\odot}$ for a Kroupa IMF. For a log-normal IMF model we obtain values of $0.33\_{-0.16}^{+0.15}$ M$\_{\odot}$ for the location parameter and of $0.68\_{-0.12}^{+0.17}$ for $\sigma$ (0.22 M$\_{\odot}$ and 0.57 for the Chabrier system IMF). All three parametrizations produce similar agreement with the data. Our results agree with previous analysis of shallower optical HST data. However analysis of similar optical data of other dwarfs finds IMFs significantly more bottom-light than in the Milky Way. These results suggest two, non mutually exclusive, possibilities: that the discrepancy of the dwarf galaxies IMF with respect to the Milky Way is, at least partly, an artifact of using a single power law model, and that there is real variance in the IMF at low masses between the currently studied nearby dwarfs, with Com Ber being similar to the Milky Way, but other dwarfs differing significantly.},

While most models are able to fit the data at low redshift, some of them struggle to simultaneously fit observations at high redshift. We separate the galaxies into 'passive' and 'star-forming' classes and find that several of the models produce too many low-mass star-forming galaxies at high redshift compared to observations, in some cases by nearly a factor of 10 in the redshift range $2.5 \lt z \lt 3.0$. We also find important differences in the implied mass of the dark matter haloes the galaxies inhabit, by comparing with halo masses inferred from observations. Galaxies at high redshift in the models are in lower mass haloes than suggested by observations, and the star formation efficiency in low-mass haloes is higher than observed. We conclude that many of the models require a physical prescription that acts to dissociate the growth of low-mass galaxies from the growth of their dark matter haloes at high redshift.},

The observed line masses (M\_line,obs) of the filaments associated with V582 and IRAS 05231+3512 are \~{}37 and \~{}28 M\_sun/pc, respectively.

Our results favour radial collapse scenario in the filaments harboring V582 and IRAS 05231+3512. In the site S234, two filaments (i.e. ns1 (M\_line,obs \~{}130 M\_sun/pc) and ns2 (M\_line,obs \~{}45 M\_sun/pc)) are identified as thermally supercritical. An extended temperature structure at 27-30 K surrounds a relatively cold (\~{}19 K) \~{}8.9 pc long filament ns1. At least four condensations (M\_clump \~{}70-300 M\_sun) are seen in ns1, and are devoid of the GMRT 610 MHz radio emission. The filament ns2 hosting clumps is devoid of ongoing SF, and could be at an early stage of fragmentation. An intense SF activity, having the SF efficiency \~{}3.3\% and SF rate \~{}40-20 M\_sun/Myr (for t\_sf \~{}1-2 Myr), is observed in ns1.

  abstract      = {Recent papers have found that the inferred slope of the high-mass ($\gt1.5$ M$\_\odot$) IMF for field stars in the solar vicinity has a larger value ($\sim 1.7-2.1$) than the slopes ($\sim 1.2-1.7$; Salpeter= 1.35) inferred from numerous studies of young clusters. We attempt to reconcile this apparent contradiction. Stars mostly form in Giant Molecular Clouds, and the more massive stars ($\gtrsim 3$ M$\_\odot$) may have insufficient time before their deaths to uniformly populate the solar circle of the Galaxy. We examine the effect of small sample volumes on the $\{$$\backslash$it apparent$\}$ slope, $\Gamma\_{\rm app}$, of the high-mass IMF by modeling the present day mass function (PDMF) over the mass range $1.5-6$ M$\_\odot$. Depending on the location of the observer along the solar circle and the size of the sample volume, the apparent slope of the IMF can show a wide variance, with typical values steeper than the underlying universal value $\Gamma$. We show, for example, that the PDMFs observed in a small (radius $\sim 200$ pc) volume randomly placed at the solar circle have a $\sim 15-30$$\backslash$\% likelihood of resulting in $\Gamma\_{\rm app} \gtrsim \Gamma+ 0.35$ because of inhomogeneities in the surface densities of more massive stars. If we add the a priori knowledge that the Sun currently lies in an interarm region, where the star formation rate is lower than the average at the solar circle, we find an even higher likelihood ($\sim 50-60\\%$ ) of $\Gamma\_{\rm app} \gtrsim \Gamma+0.35$, corresponding to $\Gamma\_{\rm app} \gtrsim 1.7$ when the underlying $\Gamma= 1.35$.},

We find that the UV emission is extended at least up to 1.7 kpc, with the NUV emission more extended than the FUV. We create UV color maps ((F148W$-$N245M) and (F148W$-$N263M)) to study the temperature morphology of young stellar complexes with the help of theoretical models. We identify several complexes with temperature T $\gt$ 17500 K which are likely to be the OB associations present in the galaxy. These complexes show good spatial correlation with the H$\alpha$ emitting regions, H$~$I distribution and HST detected hot stars. The hot star forming regions are found to be clumpy in nature and show a hierarchical structure, with sizes in the range of 4 - 50 pc, with a large number with sizes $\lt$ 10 pc. The south western part of the galaxy shows many hot star forming regions, high level of H$\alpha$ emission and low column density of H$~$I which altogether denote a vigorous recent star formation. WLM is likely to have a large fraction of low mass compact star forming regions with mass M $\lt 10^3 M\_{\odot}$, in agreement with the size and mass of the CO clouds. We estimate the star formation rate of WLM to be $\sim$ 0.008 $M\_{\odot}/yr$, which is similar to the average value measured for nearby dwarf irregular galaxies.},

We find that the incidence and strength of the upturn remains constant up to $z=0.55$. In comparison, the prevalence and strength of the UV upturn is significantly diminished in the $z=0.7$ cluster, implying that the stellar population responsible for the upturn in a typical red sequence galaxy is only just developing at this redshift and is essentially fully-developed by $\sim 1$ Gyr later. Of all the mainstream models that seek to explain the UV upturn phenomenon, it is those that generate the upturn through the presence of a Helium-enhanced stellar subpopulation on the (hot) horizontal branch that are most consistent with this behaviour. The epoch ($z=0.7$) where the stars responsible for the upturn first evolve from the red giant branch places constraints on their age and chemical abundances. By comparing our results with the prediction made by the YEPS Helium-enhanced spectrophotometic models, we find that a solar metallicity sub-population that displays a consistent upturn between $0\ltz\lt0.55$ but then fades by $z=0.7$ would require a Helium abundance of $Y\geqslant0.45$, if formed at $z\_f\sim4$. Later formation redshifts and/or higher metallicity would further increase the Helium enhancement required to produce the observed upturn in these clusters and vice versa.},

  abstract      = {The birth of stars and the formation of galaxies are cornerstones of modern astrophysics. While much is known about how galaxies globally and their stars individually form and evolve, one fundamental property that affects both remains elusive. This is problematic because this key property, the birth mass distribution of stars, referred to as the stellar initial mass function (IMF), is a key tracer of the physics of star formation that underpins almost all of the unknowns in galaxy and stellar evolution. It is perhaps the greatest source of systematic uncertainty in star and galaxy evolution. The past decade has seen a growing number and variety of methods for measuring or inferring the shape of the IMF, along with progressively more detailed simulations, paralleled by refinements in the way the concept of the IMF is applied or conceptualised on different physical scales. This range of approaches and evolving definitions of the quantity being measured has in turn led to conflicting conclusions regarding whether or not the IMF is universal. Here I review and compare the growing wealth of approaches to our understanding of this fundamental property that defines so much of astrophysics. I summarise the observational measurements from stellar analyses, extragalactic studies and cosmic constraints, and highlight the importance of considering potential IMF variations, reinforcing the need for measurements to quantify their scope and uncertainties carefully, in order for this field to progress. I present a new framework to aid the discussion of the IMF and promote clarity in the further development of this fundamental field.},

We find that the relative masses of the SMBH and the NSC have a deep impact on the morphology of the circumnuclear gas. Extended disks form only inside the sphere of influence of the SMBH. In contrast, compact rings naturally form outside the SMBH's sphere of influence, where the gravity is dominated by the NSC. This result is in agreement with the properties of the Milky Way's circumnuclear ring, which orbits outside the SMBH sphere of influence.

Building on our previous work, we extend the Stochastically Lighting Up Galaxies code (slug) to include a high-resolution UV spectral synthesiser and equivalent width calculation capabilities. We first gain a qualitative understanding of how UV spectral features behave as the parameters that define a star cluster in slug (mass, age, extinction, and IMF slope alpha) are changed. We then exploit Bayesian inference techniques to recover the alpha values for clusters simulated with slug, using mock observations of these clusters comprised of broad-band photometry and equivalent width measurements of a selection of UV spectral features. We find some improvement when compared to attempts using broad-band photometry alone (with the interquartile range of the alpha posterior PDF shrinking by 32\%), although we still do not yet fully break the known degeneracy between the cluster mass and alpha. Finally, we make predictions about how effective real observations will be by quantifying our ability to constrain alpha as a function of limiting equivalent width. We find that observations sensitive to a modest equivalent width of 9 A are sufficient to improve the recovery of the IMF slope parameter by 32\% (interquartile range of posterior PDF median residuals), moving to 39\% when we include all the significant spectral features in the wavelength range 900-3000 A.},

  abstract      = {Evolutionary studies that compare galaxy structure as a function of redshift are complicated by the fact that any particular galaxy's appearance depends in part on the rest-frame wavelength of the observation. This leads to the necessity for a ``morphological k-correction'' between different pass-bands, especially when comparing the rest-frame optical or infrared (IR) to the ultraviolet (UV). This is of particular concern for high redshift studies that are conducted in the rest-frame UV. We investigate the effects of this ``band-pass shifting'' out of the UV by quantifying nearby galaxy structure via ``CAS parameters'' (concentration, asymmetry, and clumpiness). For this study we combine pan-chromatic data from the UV through the near-IR with GALEX (Galaxy Evolution Explorer) data of 2073 nearby galaxies in the ``NUV'' (\~{}230 nm) and 1127 in the ``FUV'' (\~{}150 nm), providing the largest study of this kind in the mid- to far-UV. We find a relationship between the CAS parameters and observed rest-frame wavelength that make galaxies appear more late-type at shorter wavelengths, particularly in the UV. The effect is strongest for E/S0 galaxies in the far-UV, which have concentrations and asymmetries that more resemble those of spiral and peculiar/merging galaxies in the optical. This may be explained by extended disks containing recent star formation. Here we also release the CAS values of the galaxies imaged in GALEX NUV and FUV for use in comparisons with deep HST imaging and JWST in the future.},

  abstract      = {Using a combined and consistently analysed GAMA, G10-COSMOS, and 3D-HST dataset we explore the evolution of the galaxy stellar-mass function over lookback times $t\_{\rm L} \in \left[0.2,12.5\right] {\rm h^{-1}\_{70} Gyr}$. We use a series of volume limited samples to fit Schechter functions in bins of $\sim\!$constant lookback time and explore the evolution of the best-fit parameters in both single and two-component cases. In all cases, we employ a fitting procedure that is robust to the effects of Eddington bias and sample variance. Surprisingly, when fitting a two-component Schechter function, we find essentially no evidence of temporal evolution in $M\_\star$, the two $\alpha$ slope parameters, or the normalisation of the low-mass component. Instead, our fits suggest that the various shape parameters have been exceptionally stable over cosmic time, as has the normalisation of the low-mass component, and that the evolution of the stellar-mass function is well described by a simple build up of the high-mass component over time. When fitting a single component Schechter function, there is an observed evolution in both $M\_\star$ and $\alpha$, however this is interpreted as being an artefact. Finally, we find that the evolution of the stellar-mass function, and the observed stellar mass density, can be well described by a simple model of constant growth in the high-mass source density over the last $11 {\rm h^{-1}\_{70} Gyr}$.},

  abstract      = {As a young massive cluster in the Central Molecular Zone, the Arches cluster is a valuable probe of the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) in the extreme Galactic Center environment. We use multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope observations to obtain high-precision proper motion and photometric measurements of the cluster, calculating cluster membership probabilities for stars down to 1.8 M$\_{\odot}$ between cluster radii of 0.25 pc -- 3.0 pc. We achieve a cluster sample with just \~{}8\% field contamination, a significant improvement over photometrically-selected samples which are severely compromised by the differential extinction across the field. Combining this sample with K-band spectroscopy of 5 cluster members, we forward model the Arches cluster to simultaneously constrain its IMF and other properties (such as age and total mass) while accounting for observational uncertainties, completeness, mass segregation, and stellar multiplicity. We find that the Arches IMF is best described by a 1-segment power law that is significantly top-heavy: $\alpha$ = 1.76 $\pm$ 0.03 (stat) $\pm$ 0.05 (sys), where dN/dm $\propto$ m$^{-\alpha}$, though we cannot discount a 2-segment power law model with a high-mass slope only slightly shallower than local star forming regions ($\alpha$ = 2.10 $\pm$ 0.11 $\pm$ 0.02) but with a break at 5.16$^{+1.25}\_{-0.65}$ $\pm$ 0.08 M$\_{\odot}$. In either case, the Arches IMF is significantly different than the standard IMF. Comparing the Arches to other young massive clusters in the Milky Way, we find tentative evidence for a systematically top-heavy IMF at the Galactic Center.},

  abstract      = {Massive galaxies in the early Universe have been shown to be forming stars at surprisingly high rates. Prominent examples are dust-obscured galaxies which are luminous when observed at sub-millimetre wavelengths and which may be forming stars at a rate of 1,000 solar masses (M$_{solar}$) per year. These intense bursts of star formation are believed to be driven by mergers between gas-rich galaxies. Probing the properties of individual star-forming regions within these galaxies, however, is beyond the spatial resolution and sensitivity of even the largest telescopes at present. Here we report observations of the sub-millimetre galaxy SMMJ2135-0102 at redshift z = 2.3259, which has been gravitationally magnified by a factor of 32 by a massive foreground galaxy cluster lens. This magnification, when combined with high-resolution sub-millimetre imaging, resolves the star-forming regions at a linear scale of only 100parsecs. We find that the luminosity densities of these star-forming regions are comparable to the dense cores of giant molecular clouds in the local Universe, but they are about a hundred times larger and 10$^{7}$ times more luminous. Although vigorously star-forming, the underlying physics of the star-formation processes at z\~{}2 appears to be similar to that seen in local galaxies, although the energetics are unlike anything found in the present-day Universe.},

  abstract = {In the local Universe, most galaxies are dominated by stars, with less than ten per cent of their visible mass in the form of gas. Determining when most of these stars formed is one of the central issues of observational cosmology. Optical and ultraviolet observations of high-redshift galaxies (particularly those in the Hubble Deep Field) have been interpreted as indicating that the peak of star formation occurred between redshifts of 1 and 1.5. But it is known that star formation takes place in dense clouds, and is often hidden at optical wavelengths because of extinction by dust in the clouds. Here we report a deep submillimetre-wavelength survey of the Hubble Deep Field; these wavelengths trace directly the emission from dust that has been warmed by massive star-formation activity. The combined radiation of the five most significant detections accounts for 30-50 per cent of the previously unresolved background emission in this area. Four of these sources appear to be galaxies in the redshift range 2$\lt$ z $\lt$ 4, which, assuming these objects have properties comparable to local dust-enshrouded starburst galaxies, implies a star-formation rate during that period about a factor of five higher than that inferred from the optical and ultraviolet observations.},

We carry out a comparative study of the bulge and global properties of a sample of spiral and S0 galaxies in a fixed environment. Our sample is flux limited and contains 262 spiral and 155 S0 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We have classified bulges into classical and pseudo-bulge categories based on their position on the Kormendy diagram. Dividing our sample into bins of galaxy stellar mass, we find that the fraction of S0 galaxies hosting a classical bulge is significantly higher than the classical bulge fraction seen in spirals even at fixed stellar mass. We have compared the bulge and the global properties of spirals and S0 galaxies in our sample and find indications that spiral galaxies which host a classical bulge, preferentially get converted into S0 population as compared to pseudo-bulge hosting spirals. By studying the star formation properties of our galaxies in the NUV-r colour-mass diagram, we find that the pseudo-bulge hosting spirals are mostly star forming while the majority of classical bulge host spirals are in the green valley or in the passive sequence. We suggest that some internal process, such as AGN feedback or morphological quenching due to the massive bulge, quenches these classical bulge hosting spirals and transforms them into S0 galaxies, thus resulting in the observed predominance of the classical bulge in S0 galaxies.},

  abstract      = {We investigate the value of the near-infrared imaging from upcoming surveys for constraining the ellipticities of galaxies. We select galaxies between 0.5 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3 that are brighter than expected Euclid sensitivity limits from the GOODS-S and N fields in CANDELS. The co-added CANDELS/HST V+I and J+H images are degraded in resolution and sensitivity to simulate Euclid-quality optical and near-infrared (NIR) images. We then run GALFIT on these simulated images and find that optical and NIR provide similar performance in measuring galaxy ellipticities at redshifts 0.5 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3. At z $\gt$ 1.0, the NIR-selected source density is higher by a factor of 1.4 and therefore the scatter in NIR-derived ellipticities is about 30\% smaller, implying a more precise ellipticity measurement. The good performance of the NIR is mainly because galaxies have an intrinsically smoother light distribution in the NIR bands than in the optical, the latter tracing the clumpy star-forming regions. In addition, the NIR bands have a higher surface brightness per pixel than the optical images, while being less affected by dust attenuation. Despite the worse spatial sampling and resolution of Euclid NIR compared to optical, the NIR approach yields equivalent or more precise galaxy ellipticity measurements. If systematics that affect shape such as dithering strategy and point spread function undersampling can be mitigated, inclusion of the NIR can improve galaxy ellipticity measurements over all redshifts. This is particularly important for upcoming weak lensing surveys, such as with Euclid and WFIRST.},

We report detections of the [O III] 52 um, [N III] 57 um, and [O I] 63 um lines from Herschel/PACS, and present high-resolution imaging of the [C II] 158 um line, and underlying continuum, using ALMA. We resolve the [C II] line emission into two spatially-offset Einstein rings, tracing the red- and blue-velocity components of the line, in the ALMA/Band-9 observations at 0.2`` resolution. The values seen in the [C II]/FIR ratio map, as low as \~{} 0.02\% at the peak of the dust continuum, are similar to those of local ULIRGs, suggesting an intense starburst in this source. This is consistent with the high intrinsic FIR luminosity (\~{} 3 x 10\^{}12 Lo), \~{} 16 Myr gas depletion timescale, and $\lt$ 8 Myr timescale since the last starburst episode, estimated from the hardness of the UV radiation field. By applying gravitational lensing models to the visibilities in the uv-plane, we find that the lensing magnification factor varies by a factor of two across SDP.11, affecting the observed line profiles. After correcting for the effects of differential lensing, a symmetric line profile is recovered, suggesting that the starburst present here may not be the result of a major merger, as is the case for local ULIRGs, but instead could be powered by star-formation activity spread across a 3-5 kpc rotating disk.},

This general insight appears to hold for populations including present-day star formation in small molecular clouds, rich and dense massive star-clusters forming in giant clouds, through to ancient and metal-poor exotic stellar populations that may be dominated by dark matter. This apparent universality of the IMF is a challenge for star formation theory, because elementary considerations suggest that the IMF ought to systematically vary with star-forming conditions.},
