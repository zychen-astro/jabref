  title       = {Characterizing Circumgalactic Gas around Massive Ellipticals at z ~ 0.4 I. Initial Results},
  abstract    = {We present a new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) absorption-line survey to study halo gas around 16 luminous red galaxies (LRGs) at z=0.21-0.55. The LRGs are selected uniformly with stellar mass Mstar>1e11 Msun and no prior knowledge of the presence/absence of any absorption features. Based on observations of the full Lyman series, we obtain accurate measurements of neutral hydrogen column density N(HI) and find that high-N(HI) gas is common in these massive quiescent halos with a median of <log N(HI)> = 16.6 at projected distances d<~160 kpc. We measure a mean covering fraction of optically-thick gas with log N(HI)>~17.2 of <kappa>LLS=0.44^{+0.12}_{-0.11} at d<~160 kpc and <kappa>LLS=0.71^{+0.11}_{-0.20} at d<~100 kpc. The line-of-sight velocity separations between the HI absorbing gas and LRGs are characterized by a mean and dispersion of <v_{gas-gal}>=29 km/s and \sigma_v_{gas-gal}=171 km/s. Combining COS FUV and ground-based echelle spectra provides an expanded spectral coverage for multiple ionic transitions, from low-ionization MgII and SiII, to intermediate ionization SiIII and CIII, and to high-ionization OVI absorption lines. We find that intermediate ions probed by CIII and SiIII are the most prominent UV metal lines in LRG halos with a mean covering fraction of <kappa(CIII)>_{0.1}=0.75^{+0.08}_{-0.13} for W(977)>=0.1 Ang at d<160 kpc, comparable to what is seen for CIII in L* and sub-L* star-forming and red galaxies but exceeding MgII or OVI in quiescent halos. The COS-LRG survey shows that massive quiescent halos contain widespread chemically-enriched cool gas and that little distinction between LRG and star-forming halos is found in their HI and CIII content.},

  abstract      = {Mid-infrared molecular hydrogen (H$\_2$) emission is a powerful cooling agent in galaxy mergers and in radio galaxies; it is a potential key tracer of gas evolution and energy dissipation associated with mergers, star formation, and accretion onto supermassive black holes. We detect mid-IR H$\_2$ line emission in at least one rotational transition in 91$\backslash$\% of the 214 Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs) observed with Spitzer as part of the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS). We use H$\_2$ excitation diagrams to estimate the range of masses and temperatures of warm molecular gas in these galaxies. We find that LIRGs in which the IR emission originates mostly from the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) have about 100K higher H$\_2$ mass-averaged excitation temperatures than LIRGs in which the IR emission originates mostly from star formation. Between 10 and 15$\backslash$\% of LIRGs have H$\_2$ emission lines that are sufficiently broad to be resolved or partially resolved by the high resolution modules of Spitzer's Infrared Spectrograph (IRS). Those sources tend to be mergers and contain AGN. This suggests that a significant fraction of the H$\_2$ line emission is powered by AGN activity through X-rays, cosmic rays, and turbulence. We find a statistically significant correlation between the kinetic energy in the H$\_2$ gas and the H$\_2$ to IR luminosity ratio. The sources with the largest warm gas kinetic energies are mergers. We speculate that mergers increase the production of bulk in-flows leading to observable broad H$\_2$ profiles and possibly denser environments.},

  abstract      = {The formation of compact dusty clouds in diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) has been recently proposed and studied by Tsytovich et al. (2014). In the present paper, an effect of the clouds on the rate of H$\to$H$\_2$ transition in the ISM is examined. We discuss the mechanisms leading to the formation of the clouds and the creation of gaseous clumps around them, analyze the main processes determining the efficiency of the recombination of atomic hydrogen on dust grains, and estimate the expected enhancement of the global H$\_2$ formation due to the presence of the clouds. In conclusion, we argue that the compact dusty clouds provide optimum conditions for the atomic recombination in diffuse ISM, and point out some astrophysical implications of the resulting H$\_2$ formation enhancement.},

  title       = {The Brightest Galaxies in the Dark Ages: Galaxies' Dust Continuum Emission During the Reionization Era},
  abstract    = {Though half of cosmic starlight is absorbed by dust and reradiated at long wavelengths (3$\mu$m-3mm), constraints on the infrared through millimeter galaxy luminosity function (the `IRLF') are poor in comparison to the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical galaxy luminosity function, particularly at z>2.5. Here we present a backward evolution model for interpreting number counts, redshift distributions, and cross-band flux density correlations in the infrared and submillimeter sky, from 70$\mu$m-2mm, using a model for the IRLF out to the epoch of reionization. Mock submillimeter maps are generated by injecting sources according to the prescribed IRLF and flux densities drawn from model spectral energy distributions that mirror the distribution of SEDs observed in $0<z<5$ dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). We explore two extreme hypothetical case-studies: a dust-poor early Universe model, where DSFGs contribute negligibly ($<$10%) to the integrated star-formation rate density at $z>4$, and an alternate dust-rich early Universe model, where DSFGs dominate $\sim$90% of $z>4$ star-formation. We find that current submm/mm datasets do not clearly rule out either of these extreme models. We suggest that future surveys at 2mm will be crucial to measuring the IRLF beyond $z\sim4$. The model framework developed in this paper serves as a unique tool for the interpretation of multiwavelength IR/submm extragalactic datasets and will enable more refined constraints on the IRLF than can be made from direct measurements of individual galaxies' integrated dust emission.},

  title       = {Cosmic-ray hydrodynamics: Alfv√©n-wave regulated transport of cosmic rays},
  abstract    = {Star formation in galaxies appears to be self-regulated by energetic feedback processes. Among the most promising agents of feedback are cosmic rays (CRs), the relativistic ion population of interstellar and intergalactic plasmas. In these environments, energetic CRs are virtually collisionless and interact via collective phenomena mediated by kinetic-scale plasma waves and large-scale magnetic fields. The enormous separation of kinetic and global astrophysical scales requires a hydrodynamic description. Here, we develop a new macroscopic theory for CR transport in the self-confinement picture, which includes CR diffusion and streaming. The interaction between CRs and electromagnetic fields of Alfv\'enic turbulence provides the main source of CR scattering, and causes CRs to stream along the magnetic field with the Alfv\'en velocity if resonant waves are sufficiently energetic. However, numerical simulations struggle to capture this effect with current transport formalisms and adopt regularization schemes to ensure numerical stability. We extent the theory by deriving an equation for the CR energy flux along the mean magnetic field and include a transport equation for the Alfv\'en-wave energy. We account for energy exchange of CRs and Alfv\'en waves via the gyroresonant instability and include other wave damping mechanisms. The resulting system of equations correctly recovers previous macroscopic CR transport formalisms in the steady-state limit. Using numerical simulations we demonstrate that our new theory self-regulates CR transport, and highlight differences to currently used algorithms. Our theory is free of tunable parameters and holds the promise to provide predictable simulations of CR feedback in galaxy formation.},

  abstract    = {We investigate the impact of quasars on the ionization of the surrounding intergalactic medium (IGM) with the radiative transfer code \texttt{CRASH4}, now accounting for X-rays and secondary electrons. After comparing with analytic solutions, we post-process a cosmic volume ($ \approx 1.5\times 10^4$ Mpc$^3 h^{-3}$) containing a ULAS J1120+0641-like quasar (QSO) hosted by a $5 \times 10^{11} {\rm M}_\odot h^{-1}$ dark matter (DM) halo. We find that: (i) the average HII region ($R\sim3.2$~pMpc in a lifetime $t_f = 10^7$~yrs) is mainly set by UV flux, in agreement with semi-analytic scaling relations; (ii) a largely neutral ($x_{\textrm{HII}} < 0.001$), warm ($T\sim 10^3$~K) tail extends up to few Mpc beyond the ionization front, as a result of the X-ray flux; (iii) LyC-opaque inhomogeneities induce a line of sight (LOS) scatter in $R$ as high as few physical Mpc, consistent with the DLA scenario proposed to explain the anomalous size of the ULAS J1120+0641 ionized region. On the other hand, with an ionization rate $\dot{N}_{\gamma,0} \sim 10^{57}$~s$^{-1}$, the assumed DLA clustering and gas opacity, only one LOS shows an HII region compatible with the observed one. We deduce that either the ionization rate of the QSO is at least one order of magnitude lower or the ULAS J1120+0641 bright phase is shorter than $10^7$~yrs.},

These rare, densest regions of a turbulent environment can become Jeans unstable and collapse to form pre-stellar cores. Using numerical simulations of magneto-gravo-turbulence, we describe the structural properties of dense shocks, which are the seeds of gravitational collapse, as a function of magnetic field strength. In the regime of a weak magnetic field, the collapse is isotropic. Strong magnetic field strengths lead to significant anisotropy in the shocked distribution and collapse occurs preferentially parallel to the field lines. Our work provides insight into analyzing the magnetic field topology and density structures of young protostellar collapse, which the theory presented here predicts are associated with large-scale strong shocks that persist for at least a free-fall time.},

  abstract      = {Recent observations suggest a scenario in which filamentary structures in the ISM represent the first step towards clumps/cores and eventually star formation. The densest filaments would then fragment into prestellar cores owing to gravitational instability. We seek to understand the roles filamentary structures play in high-mass star formation. We mapped the integral-shaped filament (ISF) in NH3 (1, 1) and (2, 2). The whole filamentary structure is uniformly and fully sampled. We find that the morphology revealed by the map of velocity-integrated intensity of the NH3 (1, 1) line is closely associated with the dust ridge. We identify 6 ``clumps'' related to the well known OMC-1 to 5 and 11 ``sub-clumps'' within the map and they are separated not randomly but in roughly equal intervals along the ISF. The average spacing of clumps is 11.30'$\pm$1.31' (1.36$\pm$0.16 pc ) and the average spacing of sub-clumps is 7.18'$\pm$1.19' (0.86$\pm$0.14 pc). These spacings agree well with the predicted values of the thermal (0.86 pc) and turbulent sausage instability (1.43 pc) by adopting a cylindric geometry of the ISF with an inclination of $60^{\circ}$ with respect to the line of sight. We also find a velocity gradient of about 0.6 km s-1 pc-1 that runs along the ISF which likely arises from an overall rotation of the Orion A molecular cloud. The inferred ratio between rotational and gravitational energy is well below unity. Furthermore, fluctuations are seen in the centroid velocity diagram along the ISF. The OMC-1 to 5 clouds are located close to the local extrema of the fluctuations, which suggests that there exist gas flows associated with these clumps in the ISF. The derived NH3 (1, 1) and (2, 2) rotation temperatures in the OMC-1 are about 30-40 K. In OMC-2, OMC-3, and the northern part of OMC-4, we find higher and lower temperatures at the boundaries and in the interior, respectively.},

  abstract      = {Turbulent dynamics generate random fluctuations in density and velocity in the Interstellar Medium (ISM) of spiral and dwarf galaxies. Observationally, H\~{}$\{$$\backslash$sc i$\}$ 21-cm radiation provides a good probe of these stochastic processes and helps us to know more about their nature and generating mechanism. Structure function, auto-correlation function, power spectrum are some of statistical estimators of these fluctuations which have been used in literature, whose studies helps in understanding the generating mechanisms of these structures. In this thesis we are interested in estimating the column density and velocity power spectrum at scales as large as 10 Kpc, to understand the energy associated with these structures and the type of forcing of the turbulence. Estimating power spectrum from observations can be done either by using the directly measured quantity visibility or by reconstructing the sky brightness distribution (or image) from the visibilities. By using simulated observations of a model galaxy with known power spectrum we find that the visibility based estimator reproduce the true power spectrum. The image based estimator has a scale dependent bias that is highly correlated to the incompleteness in the baseline coverage of the interferometer. Interestingly, we found that the noise in the reconstructed image has zero mean and hence the locally averaged quantities estimated from the reconstructed image are unbiased. We implement the visibility moment estimator as discussed in Dutta et al. (2015) and estimate the line of sight velocity fluctuation of the spiral galaxy NGC6946. Our result strongly indicate presence of large scale turbulence in the spiral galaxies. We conclude that we would need to have higher signal to noise H\~{}$\{$$\backslash$sc i$\}$observations to definitively comment on the generating mechanisms of the large scale turbulence.},

DIB profile structures constrain potential molecular carriers, but their measurement requires high S/N and spectra and the use of sightlines without Doppler splitting, as typical for a single-cloud situation. Spectra from the ESO Diffuse Interstellar Bands Large Exploration Survey (EDIBLES) conducted at the VLT (ESO/Paranal) were explored to identify single-cloud and high C2 column sightlines, extract the corresponding C2-DIBs and study their strengths and profiles, and to investigate in detail any sub-structures. The target selection was made based on profile-fitting of the Sodium doublets and the detection of C2 lines. The C2 (2-0) Phillips system was fitted using a physical model of the host cloud. C2 column densities, temperatures as well as gas densities were derived for each sightline. 18 known C2-DIBs and 8 strong non-C2 DIBs were extracted towards 8 targets, comprising 7 single-cloud and one multi-cloud line-of-sights. Correlational studies revealed a tight association of the former group with the C2 columns, whereas the non-C2 DIBs are primarily correlated with reddening. We report three new weak diffuse band candidates. We show for the first time that at least 14 C2-DIBs exhibit spectral sub-structures which are consistent with unresolved rotational branches of molecular carriers. The variability of their peak separations among the bands for a given sightline implies that their carriers are different molecules with quite different sizes. We also illustrate how profiles of the same DIB vary among targets and as a function of physical parameters and provide tables defining the sub-structures to be compared with future models and experimental results.},

By comparing $\textit{Planck}$ thermal dust data (Release 1.2) and new dust reddening maps from Pan-STARRS 1 and 2MASS (Green et al. 2018), with accurate (opacity-corrected) HI column densities and newly-published OH data from the Arecibo Millennium survey and 21-SPONGE, we confirm linear correlations between dust optical depth $\tau_{353}$, reddening $E(B{-}V)$ and the total proton column density $N_\mathrm{H}$ in the range (1$-$30)$\times$10$^{20}$cm$^{-2}$, along sightlines with no molecular gas detections in emission. We derive an $N_\mathrm{H}$/$E(B{-}V)$ ratio of (9.4$\pm$1.6)$\times$10$^{21}$cm$^{-2}$mag$^{-1}$ for purely atomic sightlines at $|b|$$>$5$^{\circ}$, which is 60$\%$ higher than the canonical value of Bohlin et al.

We report a $\sim$40$\%$ increase in opacity $\sigma_{353}$=$\tau_{353}$/$N_\mathrm{H}$, when moving from the low column density ($N_\mathrm{H}$$<$5$\times$10$^{20}$cm$^{-2}$) to moderate column density ($N_\mathrm{H}$$>$5$\times$10$^{20}$cm$^{-2}$) regime, and suggest that this rise is due to the evolution of dust grains in the atomic ISM. Failure to account for HI opacity can cause an additional apparent rise in $\sigma_{353}$, of the order of a further $\sim$20$\%$. We estimate molecular hydrogen column densities $N_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}$ from our derived linear relations, and hence derive the OH/H$_2$ abundance ratio of $X_\mathrm{OH}$$\sim$1$\times$10$^{-7}$ for all molecular sightlines. Our results show no evidence of systematic trends in OH abundance with $N_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}$ in the range $N_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}$$\sim$(0.1$-$10)$\times$10$^{21}$cm$^{-2}$. This suggests that OH may be used as a reliable proxy for H$_2$ in this range, which includes sightlines with both CO-dark and CO-bright gas.},

By integrating over the velocity width that corresponds to the molecular collision front, we find a long filamentary structure with a size of 1800 pc $\times$ 350 pc at the collision front. This filamentary molecular structure spatially coincides with a dark-lane seen in R-band image. We find four molecular clouds in the filament, each with a radius of 30 pc and mass of 10$^{6} M_{\odot}$; the radii matching a typical value for giant molecular clouds and the masses corresponding to those between giant molecular clouds and giant molecular associations. All four clouds are gravitationally bound. The molecular filamentary structure and its physical conditions are similar to the structure expected via numerical simulation. The filament could be a progenitor of super star clusters.},

The bump strength and extinction curve are shallower than the average Galactic extinction curve. We determine a metallicity of [Zn/H]$\gt$-0.98 from the VLT/X-shooter spectrum. We detect strong neutral carbon associated with the GRB with log N(CI/cm\^{}$\{$-2$\}$) =14.65+/-0.37. We also detect optical emission lines from the host galaxy. Based on the H$\backslash$alpha emission line flux, the derived dust-corrected star-formation rate is \~{}46+/-4 M\_sun/yr and the predicted stellar mass is log M*/M\_sun\~{}9.3+/-0.4, suggesting the host galaxy is amongst the main-sequence star-forming galaxies.},

  abstract      = {The central area (40``x40'') of the bipolar nebula S106 was mapped in the OI line at 63.2 micron with high angular (6``) and spectral resolution, using GREAT on board SOFIA. The OI emission distribution is compared to the CO 16-15, CII 158 micron, and CO 11-10 lines, mm-molecular lines, and continuum. It is composed of several velocity components in the range from -30 km/s to 25 km/s. The high-velocity blue- and redshifted emission can be explained as arising from accelerated photodissociated (PDR) gas associated with a dark lane close to the massive binary system S106 IR, and from shocks caused by the stellar wind and/or a disk--envelope interaction. At velocities from -9 to -4 km/s and 0.5 to 8 km/s line wings are observed that we attribute to cooling in PDRs created by the ionizing radiation impinging on the cavity walls. The bulk velocity range is dominated by PDR emission from the clumpy molecular cloud. Modelling the emission in the different velocity ranges with the KOSMA-tau code constrains a radiation field chi of a few times 10\^{}4 and densities n of a few times 10\^{}4 cm\^{}-3. Considering self-absorption of the OI line results in higher densities (up to 10\^{}6 cm\^{}-3) only for the gas component seen at high blue- and red velocities. The dark lane has a mass of 275 Msun and shows a velocity difference of 1.4 km/s along its projected length of 1 pc, determined from H13CO+ 1-0 mapping. It can be interpreted as a massive accretion flow, or the remains of it, linked to S106 IR/FIR. The most likely explanation is that the binary system is at a stage of its evolution where gas accretion is counteracted by the stellar winds and radiation, leading to the very complex observed spatial and kinematic emission distribution of the various tracers.},

We have simulated the formation of three star clusters from the gravitational collapse of molecular clouds whose densities vary by a factor of a hundred. As with previous calculations including radiative feedback, we find that the dependence of the characteristic stellar mass, $M\_{\rm c}$, on the initial mean density of the cloud, $\rho$, is weaker than the dependence of the thermal Jeans mass. However, unlike previous calculations, which found no statistically significant variation in the median mass with density, we find a weak dependence approximately of the form $M\_{\rm c} \propto \rho^{-1/5}$. The distributions of properties of multiple systems do not vary significantly between the calculations. We compare our results to the result of observational surveys of star-forming regions, and suggest that the similarities between the properties of our lowest density calculation and the nearby Taurus-Auriga region indicate that the apparent excess of solar-type stars observed may be due to the region's low density.},

  abstract      = {We present ALMA observations of the circumnuclear disk (CND) and the environment around Sgr A*. The images unveil the presence of small spatial scale 12CO (J=3-2) molecular ``cloudlets'' within the central parsec of the Milky Way and moving at high speeds, up to 300 km/s along the line-of-sight. The 12CO-emitting structures show intricate morphologies: extended and filamentary at high-negative velocities (v\_LSR$\lt$-150 km/s), more localized and compact at extreme-positive velocities (v\_LSR$\gt$+200 km/s). Based on the pencil-beam 12CO absorption spectrum toward Sgr A* synchrotron emission we also present evidence for a diffuse molecular gas component producing absorption features at more extreme-negative velocities (v\_ LSR$\lt$-200 km/s). The CND shows a clumpy spatial distribution. Its motion requires a bundle of non-uniformly rotating streams of slightly different inclinations. The inferred gas density peaks, a few 10\^{}5 cm-3, are lower than the local Roche limit, supporting that the CND is a transient structure. We apply the two standard orbit models (spirals vs. ellipses) invoked to explain the kinematics of the ionized gas streamers around Sgr A*. The location and velocities of the extreme-velocity 12CO cloudlets |v\_LSR|$\gt$200 km/s are inconsistent with the spiral model, and only two of them are consistent with the Keplerian ellipse model. Most cloudlets, however, show similar high velocities that are incompatible with the motion of the ionized streamers or with gas bounded to the central gravity. We interpret them as the leftovers of massive molecular clouds that fall into the cavity and are tidally disrupted and fragmented. These observations imply that molecular cloudlets, all together with a mass of several 10 M\_Sun, exist around Sgr A*. Most of them must be short-lived ($\lt$10\^{}4 yr): photoevaporated by the intense stellar radiation field or disrupted by strong gravitational shears. (abridged)},

  abstract      = {Diffuse soft X-ray line emission is commonly used to trace the thermal and chemical properties of the hot interstellar medium, as well as its content, in nearby galaxies. Although resonant line scattering complicates the interpretation of the emission, it also offers an opportunity to measure the kinematics of the medium. We have implemented a direct Monte Carlo simulation scheme that enables us to account for resonant scattering effect in the medium, in principle, with arbitrary spatial, thermal, chemical, and kinematic distributions. Here we apply this scheme via dimensionless calculation to an isothermal, chemically uniform, and spherically symmetric medium with a radial density distribution characterized by a $\beta$-model. This application simultaneously account for both optical depth-dependent spatial distortion and intensity change of the resonant line emission due to the scattering, consistent with previous calculations. We further apply the modeling scheme to the OVII and OVIII emission line complex observed in the XMM-Newton RGS spectrum of the M31 bulge. This modeling, though with various limitations due to its simplicity, shows that the resonant scattering could indeed account for much of the spatial distortion of the emission, as well as the relative strengths of the lines, especially the large forbidden to resonant line ratio of the OVII He$\alpha$ triplet. We estimate the isotropic turbulence Mach number of the medium in M31 as $\sim0.17$ for the first time and the line-emitting gas temperature as $\sim2.3\times10^6$ K. We conclude that the resonant scattering may in general play an important role in shaping the soft X-ray spectra of diffuse hot gas in normal galaxies.},

  abstract      = {The local interstellar medium (ISM) is suffused with ``dark'' gas, identified by excess infrared and gamma ray emission, yet undetected by standard ISM tracers such as neutral hydrogen (HI) or carbon monoxide emission. Based on observed dust properties from Planck, recent studies have argued that HI mixed with dust is strongly saturated and that dark gas is dominated by optically-thick HI. We test this hypothesis by reproducing this model using data from Planck and new 21 cm emission maps from GALFA-HI -- the first large-area 21cm emission survey with comparable angular resolution to Planck. We compare the results with those from a large sample of HI column densities based on direct observations of HI optical depth, and find that the inferred column density corrections are significantly lower than those inferred by the Planck-based model. Further, we rule out the hypothesis that the pencil-beam HI absorption sight lines preferentially miss opaque ``blobs'' with small covering fraction, as these structures require densities and pressures which are incompatible with ISM conditions. Our results support the picture that dark gas in the local ISM is not dominated by optically-thick HI, but is rather a combination of intrinsic changes in dust grain emissivities and H2 missed by CO observations.},

Our main goal is to investigate the circumburst medium in the natal regions of GRBs. Our primary focus is on the NV 1238,1242 line transitions, but we also discuss other high-ionization lines such as OVI, CIV and SiIV. We find no correlation between the column density of NV and the neutral gas properties such as metallicity, HI column density and dust depletion, however the relative velocity of NV, typically a blueshift with respect to the neutral gas, is found to be correlated with the column density of HI. This may be explained if the NV gas is part of an HII region hosting the GRB, where the region's expansion is confined by dense, neutral gas in the GRB's host galaxy. We find tentative evidence (at 2-sigma significance) that the X-ray derived column density, N\_H,X, may be correlated with the column density of NV, which would indicate that both measurements are sensitive to the column density of the gas located in the vicinity of the GRB. We investigate the scenario where NV (and also OVI) is produced by recombination after the corresponding atoms have been stripped entirely of their electrons by the initial prompt emission, in contrast to previous models where highly-ionized gas is produced by photoionization from the GRB afterglow.},

  abstract      = {We study the heating of the intergalactic medium (IGM) surrounding high redshift star forming galaxies due to cosmic rays (CR). We take into account the diffusion of low energy cosmic rays and study the patchiness of the resulting heating. We discuss the case of IGM heating around a high redshift minihalo ($z\sim 10\hbox{--}20$, M$\sim 10^5\hbox{--}10^7$ M$\_\odot$),and put an upper limit on the diffusion coefficient $D\le 1\times 10^{26}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$ for the heating to be inhomogeneous at $z\sim 10$ and $D\le 5\hbox{--}6 \times 10^{26}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$ at $z\sim 20$. For typical values of $D$, our results suggest uniform heating by CR at high redshift, although there are uncertainties in magnetic field and other CR parameters. We also discuss two cases with continuous star formation, one in which the star formation rate (SFR) of a galaxy is high enough to make the IGM in the vicinity photoionized, and another in which the SFR is low enough to keep it neutral but high enough to cause significant heating by cosmic ray protons. In the neutral case (low SFR), we find that the resulting heating can make the gas hotter than the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation for $D \lt 10^{30}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$, within a few kpc of the galaxy, and unlikely to be probed by near future radio observations. In the case of photoionized IGM (high SFR), the resulting heating of the gas in the vicinity of high redshift ($z\sim 4)$ galaxies of mass $\ge 10^{12}$ M$\_\odot$ can suppress gas infall into the galaxy. At lower redshifts ($z\sim 0$), an SFR of $\sim 1$ M$\_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ can suppress the infall into galaxies of mass $\le 10^{10}$ M$\_\odot$.},

  abstract      = {In recent years, there were studies on the omnipresence and structures of filaments in star-forming regions, and the role of their fragmentation in the process of star formation. However, only a few studies analysed the evolution of filaments and their distribution with the Galactic disk where filaments form self-consistently as part of large-scale molecular cloud evolution. In this thesis, I perform dust radiative transfer calculations to study the effect of inclination on dust observations of filaments to evaluate whether the variations enable the identification of more filaments within dust surveys. I address the early evolution of pc-scale filaments that form within individual clouds and focus on how and when the filaments fragment, and how the fragmentation relates to typically used observables. For evaluating the equilibrium state of filaments and the nature of their fragmentation I examine three simulated molecular clouds formed in kpc-scale numerical simulations modelling a self-gravitating, magnetised, stratified, supernova-driven ISM. The first fragments appear when the line masses of the simulated filaments lie well below the critical line mass of Ostrikers isolated hydrostatic equilibrium solution. This indicate that, although the turbulence of the entire clouds is mostly driven by gravitational contraction, fragmentation does not occur do to gravitational instability, but is supported by colliding flow motions. I conclude that there is no single quantity in my analysis that can uniquely trace the inclination and 3D structure of a filament based on dust observations alone. A simple model of an isolated, isothermal cylinder may not provide a good approach for fragmentation analysis, independently of the dominant driving source of the parental cloud.},

After applying completeness corrections, we fit the combined IRDC CMF with a power law of the form $d N / d\:{\rm log} M \propto M^{-\alpha}$ and derive an index of $\alpha\simeq0.86\pm0.11$ for $M \geq 0.79\:M\_\odot$ and $\alpha\simeq0.70\pm0.13$ for $M\geq 1.26\:M\_\odot$, which is a significantly more top-heavy distribution than the Salpeter stellar initial mass function (IMF) index of 1.35. We also make a direct comparison of these IRDC clump CMF results to those measured in the more evolved protocluster G286 derived with similar methods, which have $\alpha\simeq1.29\pm0.19$ and $1.08\pm0.27$ in these mass ranges, respectively. These results provide a hint that, especially for the $M\geq 1.26\:M\_\odot$ range where completeness corrections are modest, the CMF in high pressure, early-stage environments of IRDC clumps may be top-heavy compared to that in the more evolved, global environment of the G286 protoclusters. However, larger samples of cores probing these different environments are needed to better establish the robustness of this potential CMF variation.},

  abstract      = {Radical recombination has been proposed to lead to the formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in CO-rich ices in the early stages of star formation. These COMs can then undergo hydrogen addition and abstraction reactions leading to a higher or lower degree of saturation. Here, we have studied 14 hydrogen transfer reactions for the molecules glyoxal, glycoaldehyde, ethylene glycol, and methylformate and an additional three reactions where $\backslash$ce$\{$CH\_nO$\}$ fragments are involved. Over-the-barrier reactions are possible only if tunneling is invoked in the description at low temperature. Therefore the rate constants for the studied reactions are calculated using instanton theory that takes quantum effects into account inherently. The reactions were characterized in the gas phase, but this is expected to yield meaningful results for CO-rich ices due to the minimal alteration of reaction landscapes by the CO molecules. We found that rate constants should not be extrapolated based on the height of the barrier alone, since the shape of the barrier plays an increasingly larger role at decreasing temperature. It is neither possible to predict rate constants based only on considering the type of reaction, the specific reactants and functional groups play a crucial role. Within a single molecule, though, hydrogen abstraction from an aldehyde group seems to be always faster than hydrogen addition to the same carbon atom. Reactions that involve heavy-atom tunneling, e.g., breaking or forming a C--C or C--O bond, have rate constants that are much lower than those where H transfer is involved.},

Jansky}$ Very Large Array (VLA) and the $100$m $\textit{Robert C. Byrd}$ Green Bank Telescope (GBT). With an angular resolution of $6"$ (0.01 pc), these observations reveal with unprecedented detail the complex filamentary structure extending north of the active Orion BN/KL region in a field covering $\sim 6'\times 7'$. We find a 0.012 pc wide filament within OMC1, with an aspect ratio of $\sim$37:1, that was missed in previous studies. Its orientation is directly compared to the relative orientation of the magnetic field from the $\textit{James Clerk Maxwell}$ Telescope BISTRO survey in Orion A. We find a small deviation of $\sim11$$\{$$\backslash$deg$\}$ between the mean orientation of the filament and the magnetic field, suggesting that they are almost parallel to one another. The filament's column density is estimated to be 2-3 orders of magnitude larger than the filaments studied with $\textit{Herschel}$ and is possibly self-gravitating given the low values of turbulence found. We further produce maps of the gas kinematics by forward modeling the hyperfine structure of the $\mathrm{NH}\_3~(J,K)=(1,1)$ and $(2,2)$ lines. The resulting distribution of velocity dispersions peaks at $\sim0.5~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$, close to the subsonic regime of the gas. This value is about $0.2~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ smaller than previously measured in single-dish observations of the same region, suggesting that higher angular and spectral resolution observations will identify even lower velocity dispersions that might reach the subsonic turbulence regime in dense gas filaments.},

  abstract    = {Both absorption and emission line studies show that cold gas around galaxies is commonly outflowing at speeds of several hundred km$\,\textrm{s}^{-1}$. This observational fact poses a severe challenge to our theoretical models of galaxy evolution since most feedback mechanisms (e.g., supernovae feedback) accelerate hot gas, and the timescale it takes to accelerate a blob of cold gas via a hot wind is much larger than the time it takes to destroy the blob. We revisit this long-standing problem using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with radiative cooling. Our results confirm previous findings, that cooling is often not efficient enough to prevent the destruction of cold gas. However, we also identify regions of parameter space where the cooling efficiency of the mixed, `warm' gas is sufficiently large to contribute new comoving cold gas which can significantly exceed the original cold gas mass. This happens whenever, $t_{\mathrm{cool, mix}}/t_{\mathrm{cc}} < 1$, where $t_{\mathrm{cool,mix}}$ is the cooling time of the mixed warm gas and $t_{\mathrm{cc}}$ is the cloud-crushing time. This criterion is always satisfied for a large enough cloud. Cooling `focuses' stripped material onto the tail where mixing takes place and new cold gas forms. A sufficiently large simulation domain is crucial to capturing this behavior.},

  title       = {Photoinduced polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon dehydrogenation: Molecular hydrogen formation in dense PDRs},
  abstract    = {The physical and chemical conditions in photodissociation regions (PDRs) are largely determined by the influence of far ultraviolet radiation. Far-UV photons can efficiently dissociate molecular hydrogen, a process that must be balanced at the HI/H2 interface of the PDR. Given that reactions involving hydrogen atoms in the gas phase are highly inefficient under interstellar conditions, H2 formation models mostly rely on catalytic reactions on the surface of dust grains. Additionally, molecular hydrogen formation in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) through the Eley-Rideal mechanism has been considered as well, although it has been found to have low efficiency in PDR fronts. In a previous work, we have described the possibility of efficient H2 release from medium to large sized PAHs upon photodissociation, with the exact branching between H-/H2-loss reactions being molecule dependent. Here we investigate the astrophysical relevance of this process, by using a model for the photofragmentation of PAHs under interstellar conditions. We focus on three PAHs cations (coronene, ovalene and circumcoronene), which represent three possibilities in the branching of atomic and molecular hydrogen losses. We find that, for ovalene (H2-loss dominated) the rate coefficient for H2 formation reaches values of the same order as H2 formation in dust grains. This result suggests that this hitherto disregarded mechanism can account, at least partly, for the high level of molecular hydrogen formation in dense PDRs.},

  title       = {Photoinduced polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon dehydrogenation: The competition between H- and H2-loss},
  abstract    = {PAHs constitute a major component of the interstellar medium carbon budget, locking up to 10--20% of the elemental carbon. Sequential fragmentation induced by energetic photons leads to the formation of new species, including fullerenes. However, the exact chemical routes involved in this process remain largely unexplored. In this work, we focus on the first photofragmentation steps, which involve the dehydrogenation of these molecules. For this, we consider a multidisciplinary approach, taking into account the results from experiments, DFT calculations, and modeling using dedicated Monte-Carlo simulations. By considering the simplest isomerization pathways --- i.e., hydrogen roaming along the edges of the molecule --- we are able to characterize the most likely photodissociation pathways for the molecules studied here. These comprise nine PAHs with clearly different structural properties. The formation of aliphatic-like side groups is found to be critical in the first fragmentation step and, furthermore, sets the balance of the competition between H- and H2-loss. We show that the presence of trio hydrogens, especially in combination with bay regions in small PAHs plays an important part in the experimentally established variations in the odd-to-even H-atom loss ratios. In addition, we find that, as PAH size increases, H2 formation becomes dominant, and sequential hydrogen loss only plays a marginal role. We also find disagreements between experiments and calculations for large, solo containing PAHs, which need to be accounted for. In order to match theoretical and experimental results, we have modified the energy barriers and restricted the H-hopping to tertiary atoms. The formation of H2 in large PAHs upon irradiation appears to be the dominant fragmentation channel, suggesting an efficient formation path for molecular hydrogen in PDRs.},

However, when and how these stars form are still in debate. To directly constrain the origin, one powerful method is to study clusters at the epoch when mature galaxy clusters began to appear. We report measurements of the spatial distribution, color, and quantity of diffuse intracluster stars for a massive galaxy cluster at a redshift of 1.24. This is the most distant galaxy cluster to date for which those three properties of the ICL have been quantified simultaneously. Our detection of the significant ICL fraction in this unprecedentedly high redshift regime strongly indicates that intracluster stars, contrary to most previous studies, might have formed during a short period and early in the history of the Virgo-like massive cluster formation and might be concurrent with the formation of the brightest cluster galaxy.},

  abstract    = {Large-scale cosmological simulations of galaxy formation currently do not resolve the densities at which molecular hydrogen forms, implying that the atomic-to-molecular transition must be modeled either on-the-fly or in post-processing. We present an improved post-processing framework to estimate the abundance of atomic and molecular hydrogen and apply it to the IllustrisTNG simulations. We compare five different models for the atomic-to-molecular transition including empirical, simulation-based, and theoretical prescriptions. Most of these models rely on the surface density of neutral hydrogen and the UV flux in the Lyman-Werner band as input parameters. Computing these quantities on the kiloparsec scales resolved by the simulations emerges as the main challenge. We show that the commonly used Jeans length approximation to the column density of a system can be biased and exhibits large cell-to-cell scatter. Instead, we propose to compute all surface quantities in face-on projections and perform the modeling in two dimensions. In general, the two methods agree on average but their predictions diverge for individual galaxies and for models based on the observed mid-plane pressure of galaxies. We model the UV radiation from young stars by assuming a constant escape fraction and optically thin propagation throughout the galaxy. With these improvements, we find that the five models for the atomic-to-molecular transition roughly agree on average but that the details of the modeling matter for individual galaxies and the spatial distribution of molecular hydrogen. We emphasize that the estimated molecular fractions are approximate due to the significant systematic uncertainties.},

  abstract      = {We investigate the impact of the far ultraviolet (FUV) heating rate on the stability of the three-phase interstellar medium using three-dimensional simulations of a $1$ kpc$^2$, vertically-extended domain. The FUV heating rate sets the range of thermal pressures across which the cold ($\sim10^2$ K) and warm ($\sim10^4$ K) neutral media (CNM and WNM) can coexist in equilibrium. Even absent a variable star formation rate regulating the FUV heating rate, the gas physics keeps the pressure in the two-phase regime: because radiative heating and cooling processes happen on shorter timescales than sound wave propagation, turbulent compressions tend to keep the interstellar medium within the CNM-WNM pressure regime over a wide range of heating rates. The thermal pressure is set primarily by the heating rate with little influence from the hydrostatics. The vertical velocity dispersion adjusts as needed to provide hydrostatic support given the thermal pressure: when the turbulent pressure $\langle\rho\rangle\sigma\_z^2$ is calculated over scales $\gtrsim500$ pc, the thermal plus turbulent pressure approximately equals the weight of the gas. The warm gas volume filling fraction is $0.2\ltf\_w\lt0.8$ over a factor of less than three in heating rate, with $f\_w$ near unity at higher heating rates and near zero at lower heating rates. We suggest that cosmological simulations that do not resolve the CNM should maintain an interstellar thermal pressure within the two-phase regime.},

It is found that LVHIS galaxies hold a tight linear FIR-radio correlation (FRC) over four orders of magnitude ($F\_{1.4GHz} \propto F\_{FIR}^{1.00\pm0.08}$). However, for detected galaxies only, a trend of larger FIR-to-radio ratio with decreasing flux density is observed. We estimate the star formation rate by combining UV and mid-IR data using empirical calibration. It is confirmed that both FIR and radio emission are strongly connected with star formation but with significant non-linearity. Dwarf galaxies are found radiation deficient in both bands, when normalized by star formation rate. It urges a ``conspiracy'' to keep the FIR-to-radio ratio generally constant for dwarf galaxies. By using partial correlation coefficient in Pearson definition, we identify the key galaxy properties associated with the FIR and radio deficiency. Some major factors, such as stellar mass surface density, will cancel out when taking the ratio between FIR and radio fluxes. The remaining factors, such as HI-to-stellar mass ratio and galaxy size, are expected to cancel each other due to the distribution of galaxies in the parameter space. Such cancellation is probably responsible for the ``conspiracy'' to keep the FRC alive.},

Their influence depends on the grain composition, size, and geometrical structure which vary throughout the dust lifecycle. Grain growth arises in dense media as traced by an enhancement of the FIR emissivity and by cloudshine and coreshine. We investigate the imprint of the grain characteristics on the dust unpolarised optical properties from the visible to the FIR for isolated grains and aggregates. Using optical constants for both carbonaceous and silicate materials, we derive the absorption and scattering efficiencies, the asymmetry factor of the phase function, the albedo, and the mass opacity, using either Mie theory or DDA. We study the effects of the size, porosity and shape of the grains, and of the monomers constituting the aggregates, on the optical properties. For aggregates we study the influence of the number of monomers and of mixing monomer sizes. Grain structure changes result in variations at all wavelengths. Porosity, grain elongation, and aggregation all produce an increase in the FIR opacity. The spectral dependence of this increase depends on the nature of the material composing the grain: it is independent of the wavelength for insulators but not for conductors. For aggregates, the FIR increase does not depend on the monomer size and saturates for aggregates containing 6 or more monomers. For silicates, the MIR spectral feature at 18 microns is more sensitive to the details of the grain structure than the 10 microns feature. This study provides a basis for understanding the range of variations achievable as a result of varying the grain characteristics. It emphasises the importance of considering the detailed grain structure in determining the dust optical properties and of using exact methods.},

Addition reactions allow unsaturated bonds to be fully hydrogenated, while abstraction reactions recreate radicals that may undergo radical-radical recombination reactions.

Here, we investigate a total of 29 reactions of the hydrogen atom with propynal, propargyl alcohol, propenal, allyl alcohol, and propanal by means of quantum chemical methods to quantify the reaction rate constants involved. First of all, our results are in good agreement with and can explain the observed experimental findings. The hydrogen addition to the aldehyde group, either on the C or O side, is indeed slow for all molecules considered. Abstraction of the H atom of the aldehyde group, on the other hand, is among the faster reactions. Furthermore, hydrogen addition to C--C double bonds is generally faster than to triple bonds. In both cases, addition on the terminal carbon atom that is not connected to other functional groups is easiest. Finally, we wish to stress that it is not possible to predict rate constants based solely on the type of reaction: the specific functional groups attached to a backbone play a crucial role and can lead to a spread of several orders of magnitude in the rate constant.},

The absorbing gas distribution is anisotropic, with an excess along the minor-axis of the galaxies, indicating an outflow origin of the absorbing gas. The ratio between the velocity dispersion of the cool CGM and that of its host dark matter halo is about one for ELGs but about half for LRGs. These results show that the dichotomy of galaxy types is reflected in both the density distribution and kinematics of the CGM traced by metal absorption lines.

  abstract      = {The energetic feedback that is generated by radio jets in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has been suggested to be able to produce fast outflows of atomic hydrogen (HI) gas that can be studied in absorption at high spatial resolution. We have used the Very Large Array (VLA) and a global very-long-baseline-interferometry (VLBI) array to locate and study in detail the HI outflow discovered with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) in the re-started radio galaxy 3C 236. We confirm, from the VLA data, the presence of a blue-shifted wing of the HI with a width of $\sim1000\mathrm{\,km\,s^{-1}}$. This HI outflow is partially recovered by the VLBI observation. In particular, we detect four clouds with masses of $0.28\text{-}1.5\times 10^4M\_\odot$ with VLBI that do not follow the regular rotation of most of the HI. Three of these clouds are located, in projection, against the nuclear region on scales of $\lesssim 40\mathrm{\,pc}$, while the fourth is co-spatial to the south-east lobe at a projected distance of $\sim270\mathrm{\,pc}$. Their velocities are between $150$ and $640\mathrm{\,km\,s^{-1}}$ blue-shifted with respect to the velocity of the disk-related HI. These findings suggest that the outflow is at least partly formed by clouds, as predicted by some numerical simulations and originates already in the inner (few tens of pc) region of the radio galaxy. Our results indicate that all of the outflow could consist of many clouds with perhaps comparable properties as the ones detected, distributed also at larger radii from the nucleus where the lower brightness of the lobe does not allow us to detect them. However, we cannot rule out the presence of a diffuse component of the outflow. The fact that 3C 236 is a low excitation radio galaxy, makes it less likely that the optical AGN is able to produce strong radiative winds leaving the radio jet as the main driver for the HI outflow.},

We used the rolling Hough transform (RHT) to identify and characterize the orientation of the straight depolarization canals in radio polarimetric data and the filaments in Hi data. Results. The majority of the straight depolarization canals and the Hi filaments are inclined by 10deg with respect to the Galactic plane and are aligned with the plane-of-sky magnetic field orientation probed by the Planck dust polarization data. The other distinct orientation, of 65deg with respect to the Galactic plane, is associated with the orientation of a bar-like structure observed in the 3C 196 field at 350 MHz. Conclusions. An alignment between three distinct tracers of the (local) interstellar medium (ISM) suggests that an ordered magnetic field plays a crucial role in confining different ISM phases. The majority of the straight depolarization canals are a result of a projection of the complicated 3D distribution of the ISM.

  abstract      = {We compare vertical profiles of the extraplanar H$\alpha$ emission to those of the UV emission for 38 nearby edge-on late-type galaxies. It is found that detection of the ``diffuse'' extraplanar dust (eDust), traced by the vertically extended, scattered UV starlight, always coincides with the presence of the extraplanar H$\alpha$ emission. A strong correlation between the scale heights of the extraplanar H$\alpha$ and UV emissions is also found; the scale height at H$\alpha$ is found to be $\sim0.74$ of the scale height at FUV. Our results may indicate the multiphase nature of the diffuse ionized gas and dust in the galactic halos. The existence of eDust in galaxies where the extraplanar H$\alpha$ emission is detected suggests that a larger portion of the extraplanar H$\alpha$ emission than that predicted in previous studies may be caused by H$\alpha$ photons that originate from H II regions in the galactic plane and are subsequently scattered by the eDust. This possibility raise a in studying the eDIG. We also find that the scale heights of the extraplanar emissions normalized to the galaxy size correlate well with the star formation rate surface density of the galaxies. The properties of eDust in our galaxies is on a continuation line of that found through previous observations of the extraplanar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons emission in more active galaxies known to have galactic winds.},

  abstract      = {In 2012, Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause, becoming the first human-made object to exit the solar system. This milestone signifies the beginning of an important new era for local interstellar medium (LISM) exploration. We present measurements of the structure and composition of the LISM in the immediate path of the Voyager spacecraft by using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) spectra of nearby stars that lie along the same lines of sight. We provide a comprehensive inventory of LISM absorption in the near-ultraviolet (2600-2800 Angstroms) and far-ultraviolet (1200-1500 Angstroms). The LISM absorption profiles are used to make comparisons between each pair of closely spaced ($\lt$15 deg) sight lines. With fits to several absorption lines, we make measurements of the physical properties of the LISM. We estimate electron density along the Voyager 2 sight line, and our values are consistent with recent measurements by Voyager 1. Excess absorption in the HI Ly-alpha line displays the presence of both the heliosphere and an astrosphere around GJ 780. This is only the 14th detection of an astrosphere, and the large mass-loss rate ($\dot{M} = 10\dot{M}\_\odot$) is consistent with other subgiant stars. The heliospheric absorption matches the predicted strength for a sight line 58 deg from the upwind direction. As both HST and Voyager reach the end of their lifetimes, we have the opportunity to synthesize their respective observations, combining in situ measurements with the shortest possible line-of-sight measurements to study the Galactic ISM surrounding the Sun.},

  abstract      = {Dense molecular gas and star formation are correlated in galaxies. The effect of low metallicity on this relationship is crucial for interpreting observations of high redshift galaxies, which have lower metallicities than galaxies today. However, it remains relatively unexplored because dense molecular gas tracers like HCN and HCO+ are faint in low metallicity systems. We present Green Bank Telescope observations of HCN(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) on giant molecular cloud (34pc) scales in the nearby low metallicity ($12+\log({\rm O/H})=8.2$) starburst IC 10 and compare them to those in other galaxies. We detect HCN and HCO+ in one and three of five pointings, respectively. The $I\_{\rm HCN}/I\_{\rm HCO+}$ values are within the range seen in other galaxies, but are most similar to those seen in other low metallicity sources and in starbursts. The detections follow the fiducial $L\_{\rm IR}$-$L\_{\rm HCN}$ and $L\_{\rm IR}$-$L\_{\rm HCO+}$ relationships. These trends suggest that HCN and HCO+ can be used to trace dense molecular gas at metallicities of 1/4 $Z\_\odot$, to first order. The dense gas fraction is similar to that in spiral galaxies, but lower than that in U/LIRGs. The dense molecular gas star formation efficiency, however, is on the upper end of those in normal galaxies and consistent with those in U/LIRGs. These results suggest that the CO and HCN/HCO+ emission occupy the same relative volumes as at higher metallicity, but that the entire emitting structure is reduced in size. Dense gas mass estimates for high redshift galaxies may need to be corrected for this effect.},

  abstract    = {Ubiquitous detections of cold/warm gas around galaxies indicate that the circumgalactic medium (CGM) is multiphase and dynamic. Recent state-of-the-art cosmological galaxy simulations have generally underproduced the column density of cold halo gas. We argue that this may be due to a mismatch of spatial resolution in the circumgalactic space and the relevant physical scales at which the cold gas operates. Using semi-analytic calculations and a set of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, we present a multiphase model of the gaseous halos around galaxies, the circumgalactic mist (CGm). The CGm model is based on the idea that the observed cold halo gas may be a composite of cold, dense and small cloudlets embedded in a hot diffuse halo, resembling terrestrial clouds and mist. We show that the resulting cold gas from thermal instabilities conforms to a characteristic column density of $N_{\rm H}\approx 10^{17}\rm{cm^{-2}}$ as predicted by the $c_s t_{\rm cool}$ ansatz. The model implies a large number of cold clumps in the inner galactic halo with a small volume filling factor but large covering fraction. The model also naturally gives rise to spatial extents and differential covering fractions of cold, warm and hot gas. To self-consistently model the co-evolution of the CGM and star formation within galaxies, future simulations must address the mismatch of the spatial resolution and characteristic scale of cold gas.},

All samples have Spitzer mid-IR spectra, and Herschel and ground-based submillimeter imaging covering the full IR spectral energy distribution, allowing us to robustly measure {L}{IR}{SF}, {T}{dust}, and {M}{dust} for every galaxy. Despite similar infrared luminosities, z> 0.5 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFG) have a factor of 5 higher dust masses and 5 K colder temperatures. The increase in dust mass is linked to an increase in the gas fractions with redshift, and we do not observe a similar increase in stellar mass or star formation efficiency. {L}160{SF}/{L}70{SF}, a proxy for {T}{dust}, is strongly correlated with {L}{IR}{SF}/{M}{dust} independently of redshift. We measure merger classification and galaxy size for a subsample, and there is no obvious correlation between these parameters and {L}{IR}{SF}/{M}{dust} or {L}160{SF}/{L}70{SF}. In DSFG, the change in {L}{IR}{SF}/{M}{dust} can fully account for the observed colder dust temperatures, suggesting that any change in the spatial extent of the interstellar medium is a second-order effect.},

This quasar sample represents an ideal laboratory to study the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the end stages of the epoch of reionization, and constrain the timing and morphology of the phase transition. For a subset of $23$ of our highest signal-to-noise ratio spectra (S/N$\gt7$, per $10\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ pixel), we present a new measurement of the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest opacity spanning the redshift range $4.8\lesssim z\lesssim6.3$. We carefully eliminate spectral regions that could be causing biases in our measurements due to additional transmitted flux in the proximity zone of the quasars, or extra absorption caused by strong intervening absorption systems along the line of sight. We compare the observed evolution of the IGM opacity with redshift to predictions from a hydrodynamical simulation with uniform ultraviolet background (UVB) radiation, as well as two semi-numerical patchy reionization models, one with a fluctuating UVB and another with a fluctuating temperature field. Our measurements show a steep rise in opacity at $z\gtrsim5.0$ and an increased scatter and thus support the picture of a spatially inhomogeneous reionization process, consistent with previous work. However, we measure significantly higher optical depths at $5.3\lesssim z\lesssim5.7$ than previous studies, which reduces the contrast between the highest opacity Gunn-Peterson troughs and the average opacity trend of the IGM, which may relieve some of the previously noted tension between these measurements and reionization models.},

We perform very high resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of five dwarf galaxies to z = 4 with our mechanical SN feedback model. This delivers the correct amount of momentum corresponding to the stage of the SN remnant evolution resolved, and has been shown to lead to realistic dwarf properties in isolated simulations. We find that in 4 out of our 5 simulated cosmological dwarfs, SN feedback has insufficient impact resulting in excessive stellar masses, extremely compact sizes and central super-solar stellar metallicities. The failure of the SN feedback in our dwarfs is physical in nature and is the result of the build up of very dense gas in the early universe due to mergers and cosmic inflows prior to the first SN occurring. We demonstrate that our results are insensitive to resolution (provided that it is high enough), details of the (spatially uniform) UV background and reasonable alterations to the star formation prescription. We therefore conclude that other physical processes, such as additional forms of stellar feedback or as yet unresolved turbulent support, are required to prevent the excessive build up of dense gas hence allowing SNe to regulate dwarf properties.},

  abstract      = {We performed sensitive observations of the N15ND+(1-0) and 15NND+(1-0) lines toward the prestellar core L1544 using the IRAM 30m telescope. The lines are not detected down to 3 sigma levels in 0.2 km/s channels of around 6 mK. The non-detection provides the lower limit of the 14N/15N ratio for N2D+ of \~{}700-800, which is much higher than the elemental abundance ratio in the local ISM of \~{}200-300. The result indicates that N2 is depleted in 15N in the central part of L1544, because N2D+ preferentially traces the cold dense gas, and because it is a daughter molecule of N2. In-situ chemistry is unlikely responsible for the 15N depletion in N2; neither low-temperature gas phase chemistry nor isotope selective photodissociation of N2 explains the 15N depletion; the former prefers transferring 15N to N2, while the latter requires the penetration of interstellar FUV photons into the core center. The most likely explanation is that 15N is preferentially partitioned into ices compared to 14N via the combination of isotope selective photodissociation of N2 and grain surface chemistry in the parent cloud of L1544 or in the outer regions of L1544 which are not fully shielded from the interstellar FUV radiation. The mechanism is the most efficient at the chemical transition from atomic to molecular nitrogen. In other words, our result suggests that the gas in the central part of L1544 already went trough the transition from atomic to molecular nitrogen in the earlier evolutionary stage, and that N2 is currently the primary form of gas-phase nitrogen.},

  abstract      = {We present ALMA and ACA [CI]$^{3}P\_{1}-^{3}P\_{0}$ ([CI](1-0)) observations of NGC6240, which we combine with ALMA CO(2-1) and IRAM PdBI CO(1-0) data to study the physical properties of the massive molecular (H$\_2$) outflow. We discover that the receding and approaching sides of the H$\_2$ outflow, aligned east-west, exceed 10 kpc in their total extent. High resolution ($0.24"$) [CI](1-0) line images surprisingly reveal that the outflow emission peaks between the two AGNs, rather than on either of the two, and that it dominates the velocity field in this nuclear region. We combine the [CI](1-0) and CO(1-0) data to constrain the CO-to-H$\_2$ conversion factor ($\alpha\_{\rm CO}$) in the outflow, which is on average $2.1\pm1.2~\rm M\_{\odot} (K~km~s^{-1}~pc^2)^{-1}$. We estimate that $60\pm20$ \% of the total H$\_2$ gas reservoir of NGC6240 is entrained in the outflow, for a resulting mass-loss rate of $\dot{M}\_{\rm out}=2500\pm1200~M\_{\odot}~yr^{-1}$ $\equiv 50\pm30$ SFR. This energetics rules out a solely star formation-driven wind, but the puzzling morphology challenges a classic radiative-mode AGN feedback scenario. For the quiescent gas we compute $\langle\alpha\_{\rm CO}\rangle = 3.2\pm1.8~\rm M\_{\odot} (K~km~s^{-1}~pc^2)^{-1}$, which is at least twice the value commonly employed for (U)LIRGs. We observe a tentative trend of increasing $r\_{21}\equiv L^{\prime}\_{\rm CO(2-1)}/L^{\prime}\_{\rm CO(1-0)}$ ratios with velocity dispersion and measure $r\_{21}\gt1$ in the outflow, whereas $r\_{21}\simeq1$ in the quiescent gas. We propose that molecular outflows are the location of the warmer, strongly unbound phase that partially reduces the opacity of the CO lines in (U)LIRGs, hence driving down their global $\alpha\_{\rm CO}$ and increasing their $r\_{21}$ values.},

For our principal sample of spiral galaxies with W1 $\le$ 10 mag and z $\le$ 0.01, we identify HI detections for 93\% of the sample. We measure lower HI-stellar mass relationships that HI selected samples that do not include spiral galaxies with little HI gas. Our observations of the spiral sample show that HI mass increases with stellar mass with a power-law index 0.35; however, this value is dependent on T-type, which affects both the median and the dispersion of HI mass. We also observe an upper limit on the HI gas fraction, which is consistent with a halo spin parameter model. We measure the star formation efficiency of spiral galaxies to be constant 10$^{-9.57}$ yr$^{-1}$ $\pm$ 0.4 dex for 2.5 orders of magnitude in stellar mass, despite the higher stellar mass spiral showing evidence of quenched star formation.},

  abstract      = {In this study, the main goal is to understand the molecular cloud core collapse through the stages of first and second hydrostatic core formation. We investigate the properties of Larson's first and second cores following the evolution of the molecular cloud core until formation of Larson's cores. We expand these collapse studies for the first time to span a wide range of initial cloud masses from 0.5 to 100 Msun. Understanding the complexity of the numerous physical processes involved in the very early stages of star formation requires detailed thermodynamical modeling in terms of radiation transport and phase transitions. For this we use a realistic gas equation of state via a density and temperature-dependent adiabatic index and mean molecular weight to model the phase transitions. We use a gray treatment of radiative transfer coupled with hydrodynamics to simulate Larson's collapse in spherical symmetry. We reveal a dependence of a variety of first core properties on the initial cloud mass. The first core radius and mass increase from the low-mass to the intermediate-mass regime and decrease from the intermediate-mass to the high-mass regime. The lifetime of first cores strongly decreases towards the intermediate- and high-mass regime. Our studies show the presence of a transition region in the intermediate-mass regime. Low-mass protostars tend to evolve through two distinct stages of formation which are related to the first and second hydrostatic cores. In contrast, in the high-mass star formation regime, the collapsing cloud cores rapidly evolve through the first collapse phase and essentially immediately form Larson's second cores.},

  abstract      = {Recent molecular line observations with ALMA and NOEMA in several Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCG) have revealed the large-scale filamentary structure at the center of cool core clusters. These filaments extend over 20-100kpc, they are tightly correlated with ionized gas (H$\alpha$, [NII]) emission, and have characteristic shapes: either radial and straight, or also showing a U-turn, like a horse-shoe structure. The kinematics is quite regular and laminar, and the derived infall time is much longer than the free-fall time. The filaments extend up to the radius where the cooling time becomes larger than the infall time. Filaments can be perturbed by the sloshing of the BCG in its cluster, and spectacular cooling wakes have been observed. Filaments tend to occur at the border of cavities driven in the X-ray gas by the AGN radio jets. Observations of cool core clusters support the thermal instability scenario, which accounts for the multiphase medium in the upper atmospheres of BCG, where the right balance between heating and cooling is reached, and a chaotic cold gas accretion occurs. Molecular filaments are also seen associated to ram-pressure stripped spiral galaxies in rich galaxy clusters, and in jet-induced star formation, suggesting a very efficient molecular cloud formation even in hostile cluster environments.},

This first measurement of the high-velocity 12CO rotational ladder toward Sgr A* adds more evidence that hot molecular gas exists inside the cavity of the CND, relatively close to the super-massive black hole ($\lt$ 1 pc). Observed by ALMA, this velocity range appears as a collection of 12CO (J=3-2) cloudlets (Goicoechea et al. 2018a) lying in a very harsh environment: pervaded by intense UV radiation fields, shocks, and affected by strong gravitational shears. We constrain the physical conditions of the high-positive velocity CO gas component by comparing with non-LTE excitation and radiative transfer models. We infer Tk \~{}400 K to 2000 K (for n\_H \~{} (0.2-1.0)x10\^{}5 cm\^{}-3).

  abstract    = {We present a new method to study the contribution of faint sources to the UV background using the cross-correlation of metal absorbers with the intergalactic medium (IGM) transmission in a proximate Quasi Stellar Object (QSO) sightline. We take advantage of a sample of $25$ high signal-to-noise ratio QSO spectra to retrieve $146$ triply-ionised carbon (\cfour) absorbers at $4.5\lesssim z\lesssim 6.2$, of which $37$ systems whose expected H{~\small I} absorption lie in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. We derive improved constraints on the cosmic density of \cfour \,at $4.3< z < 6.2$ and infer from abundance-matching that \cfour \,absorbers trace $M_{\text{UV}}\lesssim -16$ galaxies. Cross-correlation with the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest of the QSOs indicates that these objects are surrounded by a highly opaque region of neutral hydrogen to $r\lesssim 5 $ cMpc/h followed by an excess of transmission at $r\gtrsim 10$ cMpc/h detected at $2.7\sigma$. This is in contrast to equivalent measurements at lower redshifts where only the opaque trough is detected. We interpret this excess as a statistical enhancement of the local photoionisation rate due to clustered faint galaxies around the \cfour \,absorbers. Using the analytical framework described in Paper I of this series, we derive a constraint on the average product of the escape fraction and the Lyman continuum photon production efficiency of the galaxy population clustered around the \cfour \,absorbers, $\log \langle f_{\text{esc}}\xi_{\text{ion}}\rangle /[{\rm erg^{-1}~Hz}] = 25.01^{+0.30}_{-0.19}$. This implies that faint galaxies beyond the reach of current facilities may have harder radiation fields and/or larger escape fractions than currently detected objects at the end of the reionisation epoch.},

  abstract      = {Galactic winds exhibit a multiphase structure that consists of hot-diffuse and cold-dense phases. Here we present high-resolution idealised simulations of the interaction of a hot supersonic wind with a cold cloud with the moving-mesh code AREPO in setups with and without radiative cooling. We demonstrate that cooling causes clouds with sizes larger than the cooling length to fragment in two- and three-dimensional simulations (2D and 3D). We confirm earlier 2D simulations by McCourt et al. 2018 and highlight differences of the shattering processes of 3D clouds that are exposed to a hot wind. The fragmentation process is quantified with a friends-of-friends analysis of shattered cloudlets and density power spectra. Those show that radiative cooling causes the power spectral index to gradually increase when the initial cloud radius is larger than the cooling length and with increasing time until the cloud is fully dissolved in the hot wind. A resolution of around 1 pc is required to reveal the effect of cooling-induced fragmentation of a 100 pc outflowing cloud. Thus, state-of-the-art cosmological zoom simulations of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) fall short by orders of magnitudes from resolving this fragmentation process. This physics is, however, necessary to reliably model observed column densities and covering fractions of Lyman-alpha haloes, high-velocity clouds, and broad-line regions of active galactic nuclei.},

The clumps usually have multiple cores around the center. In this work, we study the effect of magnetic field morphology on the structure of massive IRDC clumps. To achieve this goal, we consider an axisymmetric isothermal oblate IRDC clump, embedded into a constant external magnetic field. We assume a polynomial function for the magnetic field morphology inside the clump. We use the numerical iterative methods to solve the equations: the successive over-relaxation method to find the magnetic and gravitational fluxes, and then the bicongugate gradient method to find the optimized values of mass and current densities. The results show that the IRDC clump will be very elongated along the perpendicular direction of the external magnetic field lines. Also, the assumption of choosing of a polynomial function for the magnetic field morphology leads to the formation of dense regions around the center. The greater the density of the central region, the larger the density of these dense regions and the closer to the center. The presence of these dense regions can lead to the formation of cores at these points.},

  abstract      = {Recent observations have detected extended TeV gamma-ray emission surrounding young and middle-aged pulsars. The morphology of these ``TeV halos'' requires cosmic-ray diffusion to be locally suppressed by a factor of \~{}100-1000 compared to the typical interstellar medium. No model currently explains this suppression. We show that cosmic-ray self-confinement can significantly inhibit diffusion near pulsars. The steep cosmic-ray gradient generates Alfven waves that resonantly scatter the same cosmic-ray population, suppressing diffusion within \~{}20 pc of pulsars younger than \~{}100 kyr. In this model, TeV halos evolve through two phases, a growth phase where Alfven waves are resonantly generated and cosmic-ray diffusion becomes increasingly suppressed, and a subsequent relaxation phase where the diffusion coefficient returns to the standard interstellar value. Intriguingly, cosmic-rays are not strongly confined early in the TeV halo evolution, allowing a significant fraction of injected e+e- to escape. If these e+e- also escape from the surrounding supernova remnant, they would provide a natural explanation for the positron excess observed by PAMELA and AMS-02. Recently created TeV cosmic-rays are confined in the TeV halo, matching observations by HAWC and H.E.S.S. While our default model relaxes too rapidly to explain the confinement of TeV cosmic rays around mature pulsars, such as Geminga, models utilizing a Kraichnan turbulence spectrum experience much slower relaxation. Thus, observations of TeV halos around mature pulsars may provide a probe into our understanding of interstellar turbulence.},

Based on combined analyses of velocity integrated channel maps and intensity variations of the optically thick 12CO spectra on and off the filament, we propose a 3-dimensional structure of the cloud surrounding the filament. We further suggest a multi-interaction scenario where sheet-like extended structures interact, in space and time, with the filament and are responsible for its compression and/or disruption, playing an important role in the star formation history of the filament. We also identify, towards the same field, a very faint filament showing a velocity field compatible with the filament formation process proposed by Inoue et al. (2017), where a filament is formed due to convergence of a flow of matter generated by the bending of the ambient magnetic field structure induced by an interstellar shock compression.},

  abstract      = {During reionization, the intergalactic medium is heated impulsively by supersonic ionization fronts (I-fronts). The peak gas temperatures behind the I-fronts, $T\_\mathrm{reion}$, are a key uncertainty in models of the thermal history after reionization. Here we use high-resolution radiative transfer simulations to study the parameter space of $T\_\mathrm{reion}$. We show that $T\_\mathrm{reion}$ is only mildly sensitive to the spectrum of incident radiation over most of the parameter space, with temperatures set primarily by I-front speeds. We also explore what current models of reionization predict for $T\_\mathrm{reion}$ by measuring I-front speeds in cosmological radiative transfer simulations. We find that the post-I-front temperatures evolve toward hotter values as reionization progresses. Temperatures of $T\_\mathrm{reion} = 17,000-22,000$ K are typical during the first half of reionization, but $T\_\mathrm{reion} = 25,000 - 30,000$ K may be achieved near the end of this process if I-front speeds reach $\sim10^4$ km/s as found in our simulations. Shorter reionization epochs lead to hotter $T\_\mathrm{reion}$. We discuss implications for $z\gt5$ Ly$\alpha$ forest observations, which potentially include sight lines through hot, recently reionized patches of the Universe. Interpolation tables from our parameter space study are made publicly available, along with a simple fit for the dependence of $T\_\mathrm{reion}$ on the I-front speed.},

Such studies have revealed a multiphase medium with a number of poorly-understood features leading to a need to study the ionization mechanism of this gas. To better interpret these observations, we make use of a suite of adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamic simulations of cold, atomic clouds driven by hot, supersonic outflows, including the effect of radiative cooling, thermal conduction, and an ionizing background characteristic of a starbursting galaxy. Using a new analysis tool, Trident, we estimate the equilibrium column density distributions for ten different ions: H I, Mg II, C II, C III, C IV, Si III, Si IV, N V, O VI, and Ne VIII. These are fit to model profiles with two parameters describing the maximum column density and coverage, and for each ion we provide a table of these fit parameters, along with average velocities and line widths. Our results are most sensitive to Mach number and conduction efficiency, with higher Mach numbers and more efficient conduction leading to more compact, high column density clouds. We use our results to interpret down-the-barrel observations of outflows and find that the adopted ionization equilibrium model overpredicts column densities of ions such as Si IV and does not adequately capture the observed trends for N V and O VI, implying the presence of strong non equilibrium ionization effects.},

  abstract      = {We investigate the effects of gradual heating on the evolution of turbulent molecular clouds of mass $2\times 10^6$ M$\_\odot$ and virial parameters ranging between $0.7-1.2$. This gradual heating represents the energy output from processes such as winds from massive stars or feedback from High Mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), contrasting the impulsive energy injection from supernovae (SNe). For stars with a mass high enough that their lifetime is shorter than the life of the cloud, we include a SN feedback prescription. Including both effects, we investigate the interplay between slow and fast forms of feedback and their effectiveness at triggering/suppressing star formation. We find that SN feedback can carve low density chimneys in the gas, offering a path of least resistance for the energy to escape. Once this occurs the more stable, but less energetic, gradual feedback is able to keep the chimneys open. By funneling the hot destructive gas away from the centre of the cloud, chimneys can have a positive effect on both the efficiency and duration of star formation. Moreover, the critical factor is the number of high mass stars and SNe (and any subsequent HMXBs) active within the free-fall time of each cloud. This can vary from cloud to cloud due to the stochasticity of SN delay times and in HMXB formation. However, the defining factor in our simulations is the efficiency of the cooling, which can alter the Jeans mass required for sink particle formation, along with the number of massive stars in the cloud.},

  abstract      = {Carbon monoxide (CO) is the second most abundant molecule in the gas-phase of the interstellar medium. In dense molecular clouds, it is also present in the solid-phase as a constituent of the mixed water-dominated ices covering dust grains. Its presence in the solid-phase is inferred from its infrared (IR) signals. In experimental observations of solid CO/water mixed samples, its IR frequency splits into two components, giving rise to a blue- and a redshifted band. However, in astronomical observations, the former has never been observed. Several attempts have been carried out to explain this peculiar behaviour, but the question still remains open. In this work, we resorted to pure quantum mechanical simulations in order to shed some light on this problem. We adopted different periodic models simulating the CO/H$\_2$O ice system, such as single and multiple CO adsorption on water ice surfaces, CO entrapped into water cages and proper CO:H$\_2$O mixed ices. We also simulated pure solid CO. The detailed analysis of our data revealed how the quadrupolar character of CO and the dispersive forces with water ice determine the energetic of the CO/H$\_2$O ice interaction, as well as the CO spectroscopic behaviour. Our data suggest that the blueshifted peak can be assigned to CO interacting $\{$$\backslash$it via$\}$ the C atom with dangling H atoms of the water ice, while the redshifted one can actually be the result of CO involved in different reciprocal interactions with the water matrix. We also provide a possible explanation for the lack of the blueshifted peak in astronomical spectra. Our aim is not to provide a full account of the various interstellar ices, but rather to elucidate the sensitivity of the CO spectral features to different water ice environments.},

  abstract      = {The Lyman-alpha emission line is the strongest feature in the spectrum of most high redshift galaxies, and is typically observed as being highly asymmetric due to galactic outflows. Quantifying this asymmetry is challenging. Here, we explore how measurements of one parameterisation, Lyman-alpha skewness, are affected by instrumental resolution and detection signal-to-noise and thus whether this can be extended throughout the archive. We model these effects through simulated lines and apply our derived corrections to existing archival data sets (including sources observed with FORS2 and DEIMOS) to reconstruct the intrinsic line emission parameters. We find a large uncertainty in parameter reconstruction at low resolutions (R$\lt$3000) and high skew values, as well as substantial random errors resulting from the masking of sky lines. We suggest that interpretations of spectral line asymmetry should be made with caution, while a simpler parametrization, like B/R (blue-red flux asymmetry), is likely to yield more robust results. We see a possible weak trend in velocity width with mass, although there is no evidence in the data for a reliable correlation of skew with galaxy mass, star formation rate or age at z=4-5. Using our results, we investigate the possibilities of recovering emission line asymmetry with current and future instruments.},

  abstract      = {In this paper, we present some correlations of neutral hydrogen HI gas and physical properties of galaxies to investigate the role of atomic gas in governing galaxy evolution. We build a HI-detected sample including 70 galaxies that are detected by ALFALFA in a 15 deg$^2$ region, and derive their star formation distribution based on the images of $\rm H\alpha$ narrow-band observed here. In general, HI-detected galaxies have low surface density of stellar mass and active star formation. Additionally, most of the galaxies are in good agreement with the star-forming main sequence, consistent with the previous findings. We confirm the dependence of star formation (SF) in galaxies on HI gas at least on global scale, i.e., star formation rate (SFR) generally increases with HI mass, specific star formation rate (SSFR$\equiv$SFR/M$\_*$) increases with HI fraction ($f\_{HI}$) even for a given stellar mass, and $\backslash$hi-based star formation efficiency (SFE) mildly increases with the stellar mass and SFR surface density. Based on the distribution of stellar mass and star formation, we calculate the morphology indices of the sample, and analyze the dependence of $f\_{HI}$ and SFE on them. The weak correlations between SFE and morphological indexes imply a weak physical link between HI and star formation in small scale. We find that $f\_{HI}$ mildly increases with the asymmetry and decreases with the concentration of galaxies, suggesting that the HI gas supply and its effect are likely correlated with external processes in the extended disks of galaxies.},

  abstract      = {With the advent of modern observational efforts providing extensive giant molecular cloud catalogues, understanding the evolution of such clouds in a galactic context is of prime importance. While numerous previous numerical and theoretical works have focused on the cloud properties in isolated discs, few have looked into the cloud population in an interacting disc system. We present results of the first study investigating the evolution of the cloud population in galaxy experiencing an M51-like tidal fly-by using numerical simulations including star formation, interstellar medium cooling and stellar feedback. We see the cloud population shift to large unbound clouds in the wake of the companion passage, with the largest clouds appearing as fleeting short-lived agglomerations of smaller clouds within the tidal spiral arms, brought together by large scale streaming motions. These are then sheared apart as they leave the protection of the spiral arms. Clouds appear to lead diverse lives, even within similar environments, with some being born from gas shocked by filaments streaming into the spiral arms, and others from effectively isolated smaller colliding pairs. Overall this cloud population produces a shallower mass function than the disc in isolation, especially in the arms compared to the inter-arm regions. Direct comparisons to M51 observations show similarities between cloud populations, though models tailored to the mass and orbital models of M51 appear necessary to precisely reproduce the cloud population.},

  abstract      = {The full-sky Planck polarization data at 850um revealed unexpected properties of the E and B mode power spectra of dust emission in the interstellar medium (ISM). The positive cross-correlation between the total dust intensity, T, with the B modes has raised new questions about the physical mechanisms that affect dust polarization, such as the Galactic magnetic-field structure. This is key both to better understanding ISM dynamics and to accurately describing Galactic foregrounds to the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). In this theoretical paper we investigate the possibility that the observed cross-correlations in the dust polarization power spectra, and specifically between T and B, can be related to a parity-odd quantity in the ISM such as the magnetic helicity. We produce synthetic dust polarization data, derived from 3D analytical toy models of density structures and helical magnetic fields, to compare with the E and B modes of observations. Focusing on the observed T-B correlation, we propose a new line of interpretation of the Planck observations based on a large-scale helical component of the Galactic magnetic field in the solar neighborhood. Our analysis shows that: I) the sign of magnetic helicity does not affect E and B modes for isotropic magnetic-field configurations; II) helical magnetic fields threading interstellar filaments cannot reproduce the Planck results; III) a weak helical left-handed magnetic field structure in the solar neighborhood may explain the T-B correlation seen in the Planck data. This work suggests a new perspective for the interpretation of the dust polarization power spectra, which strongly supports the imprint of a large-scale structure of the Galactic magnetic field in the solar neighborhood.},

  abstract      = {The interaction of gas-rich galaxies with the intra-cluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters has a remarkable impact on their evolution, mainly due to the gas loss associated with this process. In this work, we use an idealised, high-resolution simulation of a Virgo-like cluster, run with RAMSES and with dynamics reproducing that of a zoom cosmological simulation, to investigate the interaction of infalling galaxies with the ICM. We find that the tails of ram pressure stripped galaxies give rise to a population of up to more than a hundred clumps of molecular gas lurking in the cluster. The number count of those clumps varies a lot over time -- they are preferably generated when a large galaxy crosses the cluster (M$\_{200c} \gt 10^{12}$ M$\_\odot$), and their lifetime ($\lesssim 300$ Myr) is small compared to the age of the cluster. We compute the intracluster luminosity associated with the star formation which takes place within those clumps, finding that the stars formed in all of the galaxy tails combined amount to an irrelevant contribution to the intracluster light. Surprisingly, we also find in our simulation that the ICM gas significantly changes the composition of the gaseous disks of the galaxies: after crossing the cluster once, typically 20\% of the cold gas still in those disks comes from the ICM.},

In this paper, we review the modeling of the polarized Galactic emission of interest and present our strategy to best exploit the currently existing data sets. Then, we investigate a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to constrain the model parameter space through maximum-likelihood analysis. Relying on simulations, for a well-known model of the large-scale non-turbulent GMF, we provide MCMC constraints from the polarized thermal dust emission for two sets of input models of different degree of complexity, proving that the GMF geometrical structure can be self-consistently reconstructed from the dust polarized emission. We discuss limitations and caveats of the methodology and we identify sources of systematic errors in the model reconstructions. We also demonstrate that our methodology can be used to constrain the regular GMF geometry independently of the accuracy of the reconstruction of the Galactic dust grain distribution. Finally, we use the results of this analysis to demonstrate the coherence of the approach via the accuracy to which we can reconstruct Galactic synchrotron emission.},

As a first attempt, we consider three models to describe the dust density distribution across the whole Galaxy and four models for the GMF. All models are parametric and heuristics and leave us with twelve reconstructions of the GMF geometrical structure. These reconstructions are obtained at the $N\_{\rm{side}} = 64$ and provide the first constraints on the GMF obtained through Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis from thermal dust polarization data. This work demonstrates that competitive constraints on the GMF can be obtained from the polarized thermal dust sky as compared to other observational probes.},

Theory predicted that such variations should occur when the accretion flow that feeds a young massive star becomes unstable and clumpy. We have targeted the massive star-forming region W49A with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) for observations at 3.6 cm with the B-configuration at 0.8'' resolution, to compare to nearly identical observations taken almost 21 years earlier (February 2015 and August 1994). Most of the sources in the crowded field of ultracompact and hypercompact H II regions exhibit no significant changes over this time period. However, one source, W49A/G2, decreased by 20\% in peak intensity (from 71+/-4 mJy/beam to 57+/-3 mJy/beam), and 40\% in integrated flux (from 0.109+/-0.011 Jy to 0.067+/-0.007 Jy), where we cite 5 sigma errors in peak intensity, and 10\% errors in integrated flux. We present the radio images of the W49A region at the two epochs, the difference image that indicates the location of the flux density decrease, and discuss explanations for the flux density decrease near the position of W49A/G2.},

All the reactions turn out to be without barriers, highly exothermic reactions which provide a chemical route to the formation of anionic chains of the same length . Some of the anions have been observed in the dark molecular clouds and in the diffuse interstellar envelopes.Quantum calculations are carried for the corresponding reactive potential energy surfaces (RPESs) for all the odd-numbered members of the series (x=1, 3, 5, 7). We employ the Minimum Energy paths (MEPs) to obtain the relevant Transition State (TS) configurations and use the latter within the Variational Transition State ( VTS) model to obtain the chemical rates. The present results indicate that, at typical temperatures around 100 K, a set of significantly larger rate values exists for x=3 and x=5, while are smaller for CN$^-$ and C$_7$N$^-$. At those temperatures, however, all the rates turn out to be larger than the estimates in the current literature for the Radiative Electron Attachment (REA) rates, thus indicating the greater importance of the present chemical path with respect to REA processes at those temperatures. The physical reasons for our findings are discussed in detail and linked with the existing observational findings.},

Recent observations of the carbon AGB star R Scl have shown an excess emission from the detached shell around the star at submillimetre wavelengths, indicating that the dust in the shell may have so far unknown properties. We aim to constrain the properties of the dust observed in the submillimetre in the detached shells around the three carbon AGB stars U Ant, DR Ser, and V644 Sco, and to investigate possible submm-excesses also in these sources. We observed the carbon AGB stars U Ant, DR Ser, and V644 Sco at 870 micron using LABOCA on APEX. Combined with observations from the optical to far-infrared, we produced dust radiative transfer models of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with contributions from the stars, present-day mass-loss and detached shells. We tested the effect of different total dust masses and grain sizes on the SED, and attempted to consistently reproduce the SEDs from the optical to the submm. We derive dust masses in the shells of a few 10e-5 Msun, assuming spherical, solid grains. The best-fit grain radii are comparatively large, and indicate the presence of grains between 0.1 micron-2 micron. In all cases we detect an excess at 870 micron that cannot be reproduced by simply changing the grain size. We investigate the possibility of the presence of a population of cold grains, a broken emissivity law at far-infrared wavelengths, and the presence of spinning nanoparticles. However, based on the current observational data, it is not possible to draw any firm conclusions. But submm-excess has been observed in four detached-shell sources, and implies that the detached shells contain dust with currently unknown properties.},

We also present preliminary evidence that the truncation of the ISF is now taking place $16^\prime$ south of the ONC and is mediated by a torsional wave that is propagating south with a characteristic timescale $\tau\_{\rm torsion} = 0.5\,{\rm Myr}$, i.e. eight times shorter.

  abstract      = {The 21 cm hyperfine transition of the atomic hydrogen (HI) in ground state is a powerful probe of the neutral gas content of the universe. This radio frequency transition has been used routinely for decades to observe, both in emission and absorption, HI in the Galactic interstellar medium as well as in extragalactic sources. In general, however, it is not trivial to derive the physically relevant parameters like temperature, density or column density from these observations. Here, we have considered the issue of column density estimation from the HI 21 cm emission spectrum for sightlines with a non-negligible optical depth and a mix of gas at different temperatures. The complicated radiative transfer and a lack of knowledge about the relative position of gas clouds along the sightline often make it impossible to uniquely separate the components, and hinders reliable estimation of column densities in such cases. Based on the observed correlation between the 21 cm brightness temperature and optical depth, we propose a method to get an unbiased estimate of the HI column density using only the 21 cm emission spectrum. This formalism is further used for a large sample to study the spin temperature of the neutral interstellar medium.},

  abstract      = {Star formation is a multi-scale process that requires tracing cloud formation and stellar feedback within the local ($\lt$kpc) and global galaxy environment. We present first results from two large observing programs on ALMA and VLT/MUSE, mapping cloud scales (1arcsec = 47pc) in both molecular gas and star forming tracers across 90 kpc\^{}2 of the central disk of NGC 628 to probe the physics of star formation. Systematic spatial offsets between molecular clouds and HII regions illustrate the time evolution of star-forming regions. Using uniform sampling of both maps on 50-500 pc scales, we infer molecular gas depletion times of 1-3 Gyr, but also find the increase of scatter in the star formation relation on small scales is consistent with gas and HII regions being only weakly correlated at the cloud (50 pc) scale. This implies a short overlap phase for molecular clouds and HII regions, which we test by directly matching our catalog of 1502 HII regions and 738 GMCs. We uncover only 74 objects in the overlap phase, and we find depletion times $\gt$1 Gyr, significantly longer than previously reported for individual star-forming clouds in the Milky Way. Finally, we find no clear trends that relate variations in the depletion time observed on 500 pc scales to physical drivers (metallicity, molecular and stellar mass surface density, molecular gas boundedness) on 50 pc scales.},

  abstract      = {We compile and carrefully homogenize local galaxy samples with available information on stellar, $\rm HI$ and/or $\rm H\_{2}$ masses, and morphology. After processing the information on upper limits in the case of non gas detections, we determine the $\rm HI$- and $\rm H\_{2}$-to-stellar mass relations and their $1\sigma$ scatter for both late- and early-type galaxies. The obtained relations are fitted to single or double power laws. Late-type galaxies are significantly gas richer than early-type ones, specially at high masses. The respective $\rm H\_{2}$-to-$\rm HI$ mass ratios as a function of $M\_{\ast}$ are discussed. Further, we constrain the full mass-dependent distribution functions of the $\rm HI$- and $\rm H\_{2}$-to-stellar mass ratios. We find that they can be described by a Schechter function for late types and a (broken) Schechter + uniform function for early types. By using the observed galaxy stellar mass function and the volume-complete late-to-early-type galaxy ratio as a function of $M\_{\ast}$, these empirical distribution functions are mapped into $\rm HI$ and $\rm H\_{2}$ mass functions. The obtained mass functions are consistent with those inferred from large surveys. The empirical gas-to-stellar mass relations and their distributions for local late- and early-type galaxies presented here can be used to constrain models and simulations of galaxy evolution.},

  abstract      = {We discuss a high resolution (FWHM\~{} 0.45 arcsec) image of the emissive polarization from warm dust in the minispiral in the Galactic Centre and discuss the implications for the magnetic field in the dusty filaments. The image was obtained at a wavelength of 12.5 microns with the CanariCam multimode mid-infrared imager on the Gran Telescopio Canarias. It confirms the results obtained from previous observations but also reveals new details of the polarization structures. In particular, we identify regions of coherent magnetic field emission at position angles of \~{}45 deg to the predominantly north--south run of field lines in the Northern Arm which may be related to orbital motions inclined to the general flow of the Northern Arm. The luminous stars that have been identified as bow-shock sources in the Northern Arm do not disrupt or dilute the field but are linked by a coherent field structure, implying that the winds from these objects may push and compress the field but do not overwhelm it. The magnetic field in the the low surface brightness regions in the East-West Bar to the south of SgrA* lies along the Bar, but the brighter regions generally have different polarization position angles, suggesting that they are distinct structures. In the region of the Northern Arm sampled here, there is only a weak correlation between the intensity of the emission and the degree of polarization. This is consistent with saturated grain alignment where the degree of polarization depends on geometric effects, including the angle of inclination of the field to the line of sight and superposition of filaments with different field directions, rather than the alignment efficiency.},

  abstract      = {Little is known about how high-mass stars form. Around 30$\backslash$\% of the young high-mass stars in the Galaxy are observed at the edges of ionized (HII) regions. Therefore these are places of choice to study the earliest stages of high-mass star formation, especially towards the most massive condensations. High-spatial resolution observations in the millimeter range might reveal how these stars form and how they assemble their mass. We want to study the fragmentation process down to the 0.01\~{}pc scale in the most massive condensation observed at the south-western edge of the HII region RCW\~{}120 where the most massive Herschel cores ($\sim$124\~{}$M\_{\odot}$ in average) could form high-mass stars. Using ALMA 3\~{}mm continuum observations towards the densest and most massive millimetric condensation (Condensation 1) of RCW\~{}120, we used the getimages and getsources algorithms to extract the sources detected with ALMA and obtained their physical parameters. The fragmentation of the hersche cores is discussed through their Jeans mass to understand the properties of the future stars. We extracted 18 fragments from the ALMA continuum observation at 3\~{}mm towards 8 cores detected with Herschel, whose mass and deconvolved size range from 2\~{}$M\_{\odot}$ to 32\~{}$M\_{\odot}$ and from 1.6\~{}mpc to 28.8\~{}mpc, respectively. The low degree of fragmentation observed, regarding to the thermal Jeans fragmentation, suggests that the observed fragmentation is inconsistent with ideal gravitational fragmentation and other ingredients such as turbulence or magnetic fields should be added in order to explain it. Finally, the range of fragments' mass indicates that the densest condensation of RCW\~{}120 is a favourable place for the formation of high-mass stars with the presence of a probable UCHII region associated with the 27\~{}$M\_{\odot}$ Fragment 1 of Core 2.},

  title       = {Rotation in the NGC 1333 IRAS 4C Outflow},
  abstract    = {We report molecular line observations of the NGC 1333 IRAS 4C outflow in the Perseus Molecular Cloud with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array. The CCH and CS emission reveal an outflow cavity structure with clear signatures of rotation with respect to the outflow axis. The rotation is detected from about 120 au up to about 1400 au above the envelope/disk mid-plane. As the distance to the central source increases, the rotation velocity of the outflow decreases while the outflow radius increases, which gives a flat specific angular momentum distribution along the outflow. The mean specific angular momentum of the outflow is about 100 au km/s. Based on reasonable assumptions on the outward velocity of the outflow and the protostar mass, we estimate the range of outflow launching radii to be 5-15 au. Such a launching radius rules out that this outflow is launched as an X-wind, but rather, it is more consistent to be a slow disk wind launched from relatively large radii on the disk. The radius of the centrifugal barrier is roughly estimated, and the role of the centrifugal barrier in the outflow launching is discussed.},

  abstract    = {Hydroxylamine (NH$_{2}$OH) and methylamine (CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$) have both been suggested as precursors to the formation of amino acids and are therefore of interest to prebiotic chemistry. Their presence in interstellar space and formation mechanisms, however, are not well established. We aim to detect both amines and their potential precursor molecules NO, N$_{2}$O and CH$_{2}$NH towards the low-mass protostellar binary IRAS 16293--2422, in order to investigate their presence and constrain their interstellar formation mechanisms around a young Sun-like protostar. ALMA observations from the unbiased, high angular resolution and sensitivity Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey (PILS) are used. Spectral transitions of the molecules under investigation are searched for with the CASSIS line analysis software. CH$_2$NH and N$_{2}$O are detected for the first time towards a low-mass source, the latter molecule through confirmation with the single-dish TIMASSS survey. NO is also detected. CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$ and NH$_{2}$OH are not detected and stringent upper limit column densities are determined. The non-detection of CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$ and NH$_{2}$OH limits the importance of formation routes to amino acids involving these species. The detection of CH$_{2}$NH makes amino acid formation routes starting from this molecule plausible. The low abundances of CH$_2$NH and CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$ compared to Sgr B2 indicate that different physical conditions influence their formation in low- and high-mass sources.},

  title       = {Detection of the Milky Way spiral arms in dust from 3D mapping},
  abstract    = {Large stellar surveys are sensitive to interstellar dust through the effects of reddening. Using extinctions measured from photometry and spectroscopy, together with three-dimensional (3D) positions of individual stars, it is possible to construct a three-dimensional dust map. We present the first continuous map of the dust distribution in the Galactic disk out to 7 kpc within 100 pc of the Galactic midplane, using red clump and giant stars from SDSS APOGEE DR14. We use a non-parametric method based on Gaussian Processes to map the dust density, which is the local property of the ISM rather than an integrated quantity. This method models the dust correlation between points in 3D space and can capture arbitrary variations, unconstrained by a pre-specified functional form. This produces a continuous map without line-of-sight artefacts. Our resulting map traces some features of the local Galactic spiral arms, even though the model contains no prior suggestion of spiral arms, nor any underlying model for the Galactic structure. This is the first time that such evident arm structures have been captured by a dust density map in the Milky Way. Our resulting map also traces some of the known giant molecular clouds in the Galaxy and puts some constraints on their distances, some of which were hitherto relatively uncertain.},

  abstract    = {Massive stars are rarely seen to form in isolation. It has been proposed that association with companions or clusters in the formative stages is vital to their mass accumulation. In this paper we study IRAS~18144-1723, a massive young stellar object (YSO) which had been perceived in early studies as a single source. In the CO(3-2) line, we detect an outflow aligned well with the outflow seen in H$_2$ in this region. We show that there are at least two YSOs here, and that the outflow is most likely to be from a deeply embedded source detected in our infrared imaging. Using multi-wavelength observations, we study the outflow and the embedded source and derive their properties. We conclude that IRAS~18144 hosts an isolated cloud, in which at least two massive YSOs are being born. From our sub-mm observations, we derive the mass of the cloud and the core hosting the YSOs.},

  abstract = {We present far-infrared (FIR) photometry at 150 and 205 {$\mu$}m of eight low-redshift starburst galaxies obtained with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) ISOPHOT. Five of the eight galaxies are detected in both wave bands, and these data are used, in conjunction with IRAS archival photometry, to model the dust emission at {$\lambda$}$\gt$\~{}40 {$\mu$}m. The FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are best fitted by a combination of two modified Planck functions, with T\~{}40-55 K (warm dust) and T\~{}20-23 K (cool dust) and with a dust emissivity index {$\epsilon$}=2. The cool dust can be a major contributor to the FIR emission of starburst galaxies, representing up to 60\% of the total flux. This component is heated not only by the general interstellar radiation field, but also by the starburst itself. The cool dust mass is up to \~{}150 times larger than the warm dust mass, bringing the gas-to-dust ratios of the starbursts in our sample close to Milky Way values, once rescaled for the appropriate metallicity. The ratio between the total dust FIR emission in the range 1-1000 {$\mu$}m and the IRAS FIR emission in the range 40-120 {$\mu$}m is \~{}1.75, with small variations from galaxy to galaxy. This ratio is about 40\% larger than previously inferred from data at millimeter wavelengths. Although the galaxies in our sample are generally classified as ``UV bright,'' for four of them the UV energy emerging shortward of 0.2 {$\mu$}m is less than 15\% of the FIR energy. On average, about 30\% of the bolometric flux is coming out in the UV-to-near-IR wavelength range; the rest is emitted in the FIR. Energy balance calculations show that the FIR emission predicted by the dust reddening of the UV-to-near-IR stellar emission is within a factor of \~{}2 of the observed value in individual galaxies and within 20\% when averaged over a large sample. If our sample of local starbursts is representative of high-redshift (z$\gt$\~{}1), UV-bright, star-forming galaxies, these galaxies' FIR emission will be generally undetected in submillimeter surveys, unless (1) their bolometric luminosity is comparable to or larger than that of ultraluminous FIR galaxies and (2) their FIR SED contains a cool dust component.

The amount of dust obscuration at UV wavelengths correlates with the FIR-to-blue ratio; and an analysis of the correlation indicates that not only the ionizing but also the nonionizing radiation contribute to the FIR emission. The amount of UV and optical energy lost to dust obscuration accounts for most of the cool dust FIUR emission and for about 70\% of the warm dust FIR emission. The remaining 30\% of the warm dust FIR flux is probably due to dust emission from regions of star formation which are embedded in opaque giant molecular clouds and do not contribute to the integrated UV and optical spectrum. The use of the FIR emission as an indicator of high-mass star formation rate in star-forming galaxies can be problematic, since the contribution to the FIR flux from cool dust emission heated by relatively old stars is nonnegligible.},

The galaxies are drawn from the SINGS sample and cover a range of morphologies and a factor \~{}10 in oxygen abundance. Published data on local low-metallicity starburst galaxies and LIRGs are also included in the analysis. Both the stellar continuum-subtracted 8 {$\mu$}m emission and the 24 {$\mu$}m emission correlate with the extinction-corrected Pa{$\alpha$} line emission, although neither relationship is linear. Simple models of stellar populations and dust extinction and emission are able to reproduce the observed nonlinear trend of the 24 {$\mu$}m emission versus number of ionizing photons, including the modest deficiency of 24 {$\mu$}m emission in the low-metallicity regions, which results from a combination of decreasing dust opacity and dust temperature at low luminosities. Conversely, the trend of the 8 {$\mu$}m emission as a function of the number of ionizing photons is not well reproduced by the same models. The 8 {$\mu$}m emission is contributed, in larger measure than the 24 {$\mu$}m emission, by dust heated by nonionizing stellar populations, in addition to the ionizing ones, in agreement with previous findings. Two SFR calibrations, one using the 24 {$\mu$}m emission and the other using a combination of the 24 {$\mu$}m and H{$\alpha$} luminosities (Kennicutt and coworkers), are presented. No calibration is presented for the 8 {$\mu$}m emission because of its significant dependence on both metallicity and environment. The calibrations presented here should be directly applicable to systems dominated by ongoing star formation.

  abstract = {We analyze the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) UV and the optical spectra of 39 starburst and blue compact galaxies in order to study the average properties of dust extinction in extended regions of galaxies. The optical spectra have been obtained using an aperture which matches that of IUE, so comparable regions within each galaxy are sampled. The data from the 39 galaxies are compared with five models for the geometrical distribution of dust, adopting as extinction laws both the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud laws. The commonly used uniform dust screen is included among the models. We find that none of the five models is in satisfactory agreement with the data. In order to understand the discrepancy between the data and the models, we have derived an extinction law directly from the data in the UV and optical wavelength range. The resulting curve is characterized by an overall slope which is more gray than the Milky Way extinction law's slope, and by the absence of the 2175 A dust feature. Remarkably, the difference in optical depth between the Balmer emission lines H$_{alpha}$ and H$_{beta}$ is about a factor of 2 larger than the difference in the optical depth between the continuum underlying the two Balmer lines. We interpret this discrepancy as a consequence of the fact that the hot ionizing stars are associated with dustier regions than the cold stellar population is. The absence of the 2175 A dust feature can be due either to the effects of the scattering and clumpiness of the dust or to a chemical composition different from that of the Milky Way dust grains. Disentangling the two interpretations is not easy because of the complexity of the spatial distribution of the emitting regions. The extinction law of the UV and optical spectral continua of extended regions can be applied to the spectra of medium- and high-redshift galaxies, where extended regions of a galaxy are, by necessity, sampled.},

We show that the attenuation curves are primarily determined by the wavelength dependence of absorption rather than by the underlying extinction (absorption+scattering) curve; the observationally derived attenuation curves cannot constrain a unique extinction curve unless the absorption or scattering efficiency is specified. Attenuation curves consistent with the {\ldquo}Calzetti curve{\rdquo} are found by assuming the silicate-carbonaceous dust model for the Milky Way (MW), but with the 2175 {\AA} bump suppressed or absent. The discrepancy between our results and previous work that claimed the Small Magellanic Cloud dust to be the origin of the Calzetti curve is ascribed to the difference in adopted albedos; we use the theoretically calculated albedos, whereas the previous works adopted albedos derived empirically from observations of reflection nebulae. It is found that the attenuation curves calculated with the MW dust model are well represented by a modified Calzetti curve with a varying slope and UV bump strength. The strong correlation between the slope and UV bump strength, as found in star-forming galaxies at 0.5$\backslash$lt z$\backslash$lt 2.0, is well reproduced when the abundance of the UV bump carriers is assumed to be 30\%-40\% of that of the MW dust; radiative transfer effects lead to shallower attenuation curves with weaker UV bumps as the ISM is more clumpy and dustier. We also argue that some local starburst galaxies have a UV bump in their attenuation curves, albeit very weak.},

  abstract      = {We present a multiwavelength study of 28 Galactic massive star-forming H II regions. For 17 of these regions, we present new distance measurements based on Gaia DR2 parallaxes. By fitting a multicomponent dust, blackbody, and power-law continuum model to the 3.6 $\mu$m through 10 mm spectral energy distributions, we find that ${\sim}34$\% of Lyman continuum photons emitted by massive stars are absorbed by dust before contributing to the ionization of H II regions, while ${\sim}68$\% of the stellar bolometric luminosity is absorbed and reprocessed by dust in the H II regions and surrounding photodissociation regions. The most luminous, infrared-bright regions that fully sample the upper stellar initial mass function (ionizing photon rates $N\_C \ge 10^{50}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ and dust-processed $L\_{\rm TIR}\ge 10^{6.8}$ L$\_{\odot}$) have on average higher percentages of absorbed Lyman continuum photons ($\sim$51\%) and reprocessed starlight ($\sim$82\%) compared to less luminous regions. Luminous H II regions show lower average PAH fractions than less luminous regions, implying that the strong radiation fields from early-type massive stars are efficient at destroying PAH molecules. On average, the monochromatic luminosities at 8, 24, and 70 $\mu$m combined carry 94\% of the dust-reprocessed $L\_{\rm TIR}$. $L\_{70}$ captures ${\sim}52$\% of $L\_{\rm TIR}$, and is therefore the preferred choice to infer the bolometric luminosity of dusty star-forming regions. We calibrate SFRs based on $L\_{24}$ and $L\_{70}$ against the Lyman continuum photon rates of the massive stars in each region. Standard extragalactic calibrations of monochromatic SFRs based on population synthesis models are generally consistent with our values.},

  abstract      = {Effective stellar feedback is used in models of galaxy formation to regulate star formation and drive realistic galaxy evolution. Models typically include energy injection from supernovae as the dominant form of stellar feedback, often in some form of sub-grid recipe. However, it has been recently suggested that pre-SN feedback, from either stellar winds or stellar radiation, is necessary in high-resolution simulations of galaxy evolution to properly regulate star formation and properties of the interstellar medium (ISM). Following stellar winds and ionizing radiation is computationally challenging, so many prescriptions model this feedback approximately, accounting for the local destruction of dense gas clouds around newly formed stars in lieu of a full radiative transfer calculation. In this work we use high resolution simulations (1.8\~{}pc) of an isolated dwarf galaxy with detailed stellar feedback tracked on a star-by-star basis. By following stellar ionizing radiation with an adaptive ray-tracing radiative transfer method, we test its importance in regulating star formation and driving outflows in this galaxy. We find that including ionizing radiation reduces the star formation rate by over a factor of 5, and is necessary in creating the ISM conditions needed for supernovae to drive significant outflows. In addition, we find that a localized approximation for radiation feedback is sufficient to regulate the star formation rate on short timescales, but is unable to drive the same outflows as in our fiducial model. Short and long range radiation effects are both important in driving the evolution of our modeled galaxy.},

  abstract      = {The fragmentation mode of high-mass molecular clumps and the properties of the central rotating structures surrounding the most luminous objects have yet to be comprehensively characterised. Using the IRAM NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) and the IRAM 30-m telescope, the CORE survey has obtained high-resolution observations of 20 well-known highly luminous star-forming regions in the 1.37 mm wavelength regime in both line and dust continuum emission. We present the spectral line setup of the CORE survey and a case study for W3(H2O). At \~{}0.35`` (700 AU at 2 kpc) resolution, the W3(H2O) clump fragments into two cores (West and East), separated by \~{}2300 AU. Velocity shifts of a few km/s are observed in the dense-gas tracer, CH3CN, across both cores, consistent with rotation and perpendicular to the directions of two bipolar outflows, one emanating from each core. The kinematics of the rotating structure about W3(H2O) W shows signs of differential rotation of material, possibly in a disk-like object. The observed rotational signature around W3(H2O) E may be due to a disk-like object, an unresolved binary (or multiple) system, or a combination of both. We fit the emission of CH3CN (12-11) K = 4-6 and derive a gas temperature map with a median temperature of \~{}165 K across W3(H2O). We create a Toomre Q map to study the stability of the rotating structures against gravitational instability. The rotating structures appear to be Toomre unstable close to their outer boundaries, with a possibility of further fragmentation in the differentially-rotating core W3(H2O) W. Rapid cooling in the Toomre-unstable regions supports the fragmentation scenario. Combining millimeter dust continuum and spectral line data toward the famous high-mass star-forming region W3(H2O), we identify core fragmentation on large scales, and indications for possible disk fragmentation on smaller spatial scales.},

The data map the kinematics of a three billion solar mass filamentary nebula that spans the innermost 30 kpc of the galaxy's core. Its warm ionized and cold molecular components are both cospatial and comoving, consistent with the hypothesis that the optical nebula traces the warm envelopes of many cold molecular clouds that drift in the velocity field of the hot X-ray atmosphere. The clouds are not in dynamical equilibrium, and instead show evidence for inflow toward the central supermassive black hole, outflow along the jets it launches, and uplift by the buoyant hot bubbles those jets inflate. The entire scenario is therefore consistent with a galaxy-spanning ``fountain'', wherein cold gas clouds drain into the black hole accretion reservoir, powering jets and bubbles that uplift a cooling plume of low-entropy multiphase gas, which may stimulate additional cooling and accretion as part of a self-regulating feedback loop. All velocities are below the escape speed from the galaxy, and so these clouds should rain back toward the galaxy center from which they came, keeping the fountain long-lived. The data are consistent with major predictions of chaotic cold accretion, precipitation, and stimulated feedback models, and may trace processes fundamental to galaxy evolution at effectively all mass scales.},

We observed clouds of three discrete velocities: 16, 19, and 25 km/s cloud. Their masses were 0.1 x 10\^{}4 Msun, 0.3 x 10\^{}4 Msun, and 1.4 x 10\^{}4 Msun, respectively. The distribution of the 25-km/s cloud likely traces the ring-like structure observed at mid-infrared wavelength. The 16- and 19-km/s clouds have not been recognized in previous observations of molecular lines. We found observational signatures of a cloud-cloud collision, namely a bridge feature and a complementary distribution between the 16- and 25- km/s clouds. Therefore, we proposed a scenario wherein the formation of a massive star in N4 was triggered by a collision between the two clouds; however whereas the 19-km/s cloud is possibly not a part of the interaction with N4. The time scale of collision is estimated to be 0.2-0.3 Myr, which is comparable to the estimated dynamical age of the HII region of \~{}0.4 Myr. In N4W, a star-forming clump located west of N4, we observed molecular outflows from young stellar objects and the observational signature of a cloud-cloud collision. Thus, we also proposed a scenario in which massive- or intermediate-mass star formation was triggered via a cloud-cloud collision in N4W.},

The latter includes a fast ($\lt$5d) 90-degree rotation event. Our best estimate of the time delay is $146\pm6$d (1$\sigma$), considerably longer than that predicted by the lens model presented in the discovery paper. Additional model constraints will be needed before this system can be used to measure $H\_0$, for example through a detection of the lensed source's VLBI jet in image B. No time delay is visible in total flux density and this is partially due to much greater scatter in the image B measurements. This must be due to a propagation effect as the radio waves pass through the ISM of the lensing galaxies or the Galaxy.},

  abstract      = {Several models have predicted that stars could form inside galactic outflows and that this would be a new major mode of galaxy evolution. Observations of galactic outflows have revealed that they host large amounts of dense and clumpy molecular gas, which provide conditions suitable for star formation. We have investigated the properties of the outflows in a large sample of galaxies by exploiting the integral field spectroscopic data of the large MaNGA-SDSS4 galaxy survey. We find that star formation occurs inside at least half of the galactic outflows in our sample. We also show that even if star formation is prominent inside many other galactic outflows, this may have not been revealed as the diagnostics are easily dominated by the presence of even faint AGN and shocks. If very massive outflows typical of distant galaxies and quasars follow the same scaling relations observed locally, then the star formation inside high-z outflows can be up to several 100 Msun/yr and could contribute substantially to the early formation of the spheroidal component of galaxies. Star formation in outflows can also potentially contribute to establishing the scaling relations between black holes and their host spheroids. Moreover, supernovae exploding on large orbits can chemically enrich in-situ and heat the circumgalactic and intergalactic medium. Finally, young stars ejected on large orbits may also contribute to the reionization of the Universe.},

Indeed, several recent models predict that such massive outflows may ignite star formation within the outflow itself. This star-formation mode, in which stars form with high radial velocities, could contribute to the morphological evolution of galaxies, to the evolution in size and velocity dispersion of the spheroidal component of galaxies, and would contribute to the population of high-velocity stars, which could even escape the galaxy. Such star formation could provide in situ chemical enrichment of the circumgalactic and intergalactic medium (through supernova explosions of young stars on large orbits), and some models also predict it to contribute substantially to the star-formation rate observed in distant galaxies. Although there exists observational evidence for star formation triggered by outflows or jets into their host galaxy, as a consequence of gas compression, evidence for star formation occurring within galactic outflows is still missing. Here we report spectroscopic observations that unambiguously reveal star formation occurring in a galactic outflow at a redshift of 0.0448. The inferred star-formation rate in the outflow is larger than 15 solar masses per year. Star formation may also be occurring in other galactic outflows, but may have been missed by previous observations owing to the lack of adequate diagnostics.},

Here, we present a backward evolution model for interpreting number counts, redshift distributions, and cross-band flux density correlations in the infrared and submillimeter sky, from 70 {$\mu$}m{\ndash}2 mm, using a model for the IRLF out to the epoch of reionization. Mock submillimeter maps are generated by injecting sources according to the prescribed IRLF and flux densities drawn from model spectral energy distributions that mirror the distribution of SEDs observed in 0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 5 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). We explore two extreme hypothetical case studies: a dust-poor early universe model, where DSFGs contribute negligibly ($\lt$10\%) to the integrated star formation rate density at z $\gt$ 4 and an alternate dust-rich early universe model, where DSFGs dominate {\sim}90\% of z $\gt$ 4 star formation. We find that current submm/mm data sets do not clearly rule out either of these extreme models. We suggest that future surveys at 2 mm will be crucial to measuring the IRLF beyond z {\sim} 4.

  abstract      = {We use the photon flux and absorption tracer algorithm presented in Katz et al. 2018, to characterise the contribution of haloes of different mass and stars of different age and metallicity to the reionization of the Universe. We employ a suite of cosmological multifrequency radiation hydrodynamics AMR simulations that are carefully calibrated to reproduce a realistic reionization history and galaxy properties at $z \geq 6$. In our simulations, haloes with mass $10^9{\rm M\_{\odot}}h^{-1}\ltM\lt10^{10}{\rm M\_{\odot}}h^{-1}$, stars with metallicity $10^{-3}Z\_{\odot}\ltZ\lt10^{-1.5}Z\_{\odot}$, and stars with age $3\,{\rm Myr} \lt t \lt 10 \, {\rm Myr}$ dominate reionization by both mass and volume. We show that the sources that reionize most of the volume of the Universe by $z=6$ are not necessarily the same sources that dominate the meta-galactic UV background at the same redshift. We further show that in our simulations, the contribution of each type of source to reionization is not uniform across different gas phases. The IGM, CGM, filaments, ISM, and rarefied supernova heated gas have all been photoionized by different classes of sources. Collisional ionisation contributes at both the lowest and highest densities. In the early stages of the formation of individual HII bubbles, reionization proceeds with the formation of concentric shells of gas ionised by different classes of sources, leading to large temperature variations as a function of galacto-centric radius. The temperature structure of individual HII bubbles may thus give insight into the star formation history of the galaxies acting as the first ionising sources. Our explorative simulations highlight how the complex nature of reionization can be better understood by using our photon tracer algorithm.},

Our previous first principles calculation revieled that viod induced coronene (C23H12)2+ and circumcoronene (C53H18)1+ could reproduce such spectrum very well. In this study, quantum-mechanic origin was studied through atomic configuration change and atomic vibration mode analysis. By a high speed particle attack, carbon void would be introduced in PAH. Molecular configuration was deformed by the Jahn-Teller quantum effect. Carbon SP3 local bond was created among SP2 graphene like carbon network. Also, carbon tetrahedron local structure was created. Such peculiar structure is the quantum origin. Those metamorphosed molecules would be photo-ionized by the central star strong photon irradiation resulting cation molecules. Atomic vibration mode of cation molecule (C23H12)2+ was compared with that of neutral one (C23H12). At 3.3 micrometer, both molecules show show C-H stretching mode and give fairly large infrared intensity. At 6.2,7.6,7.8, and 8.6 micrometer bands, cation molecule show complex C-C stretching and shrinking mixing modes and remain large infrared emission. Whereas, neutral molecule gives harmonic motion, which cancelles each other resulting very small infrared intensity. At 11.3 micrometer, both neutral and cation molecules show C-H bending motion perpendicular to a molecular plane, which contributes to strong emission. Actual observed spectrum would be a sum of such quantum-mechanic origined molecules.},

  abstract      = {The potential similarity of the powering mechanisms of relativistic SNe and GRBs allowed us to make a prediction that relativistic SNe are born in environments similar to those of GRBs, that is, ones which are rich in atomic gas. Here we embark on testing this hypothesis by analysing the properties of the host galaxy NGC 3278 of the relativistic SN 2009bb. This is the first time the atomic gas properties of a relativistic SN host are provided and the first time resolved 21 cm-hydrogen-line (HI) information is provided for a host of an SN of any type in the context of the SN position. We obtained radio observations with ATCA covering the HI line, and optical integral field unit spectroscopy observations with MUSE. The atomic gas distribution of NGC 3278 is not centred on the optical galaxy centre, but instead around a third of atomic gas resides in the region close to the SN position. This galaxy has a few times lower atomic and molecular gas masses than predicted from its SFR. SN 2009bb exploded close to the region with the highest SFR density and the lowest age (\~{}5.5 Myr, corresponding to the initial mass of the progenitor star \~{}36 Mo). As for GRB hosts, the gas properties of NGC 3278 are consistent with a recent inflow of gas from the intergalactic medium, which explains the concentration of atomic gas close to the SN position and the enhanced SFR. Super-solar metallicity at the position of the SN (unlike for most GRBs) may mean that relativistic explosions signal a recent inflow of gas (and subsequent star formation), and their type (GRBs or SNe) is determined either i) by the metallicity of the inflowing gas, so that metal-poor gas results in a GRB explosion and metal-rich gas results in a relativistic SN explosion without an accompanying GRB, or ii) by the efficiency of gas mixing, or iii) by the type of the galaxy.},

  title       = {Hot Grain Dynamics by Electric Charging and Magnetic Trapping in Debris Disks},
  abstract    = {The recent discovery of hot dust grains in the vicinity of main-sequence stars has become a hot issue among the scientific community of debris disks. Hot grains must have been enormously accumulated near their sublimation zones, but it is a mystery how such a high concentration of hot grains is sustained. The most difficult conundrum is that the size of hot dust grains is estimated to lie in the submicrometer range, while submicrometer-sized grains are instantly swept away from near-stellar environments by stellar radiation pressure. One and only mechanism proposed for prolonging the residence time of hot grains in the near-stellar environments is trapping of charged nanoparticles by stellar magnetic fields. We revisit the model of magnetic grain trapping around main-sequence stars of various spectral classes by taking into account sublimation and electric charging of the grains. The model of magnetic grain trapping predicts that hot dust grains are present in the vicinity of main-sequence stars with high rotation velocities and intermediate magnetic-field strengths. On the contrary, we find that the detection of hot dust grains has no correlation with the rotation velocities of central stars nor the magnetic field strengths of the stars. Our numerical evaluation of electric grain charging indicates that the surface potential of submicrometer-sized grains in the vicinity of main-sequence stars is typically 4-5 V, which is one order of magnitude smaller than the value assumed by the model of magnetic grain trapping. On the basis of our numerical simulation on sublimation of dust grains in the vicinity of a star, it turns out that their lives end due to sublimation in a timescale much shorter than the period of one revolution at the gyroradius. It is, therefore, infeasible to dynamically extend the dwell time of hot grains inside the sublimation zone by magnetic trapping, ...},

  abstract      = {Stars are bad neighbors: they often disturb their surroundings. They sometimes travel very fast through the interstellar medium (ISM). They frequently undergo violent ejection events which leave an imprint on their neighborhood (jets, winds, supernovae). These supersonic flows generate shocks both in the ejected material (bow shock) and in the stellar environment (termination shock). The global purpose of this thesis is to link the properties of stars and the ISM by studying these shocks. We model them with the Paris-Durham planar shock code, which incorporates a wealth of micro-physics and chemical processes relevant to the magnetized ISM. In the first part, we model 3D magnetized axis-symmetric bow shock by a statistical distribution of 1D planar shocks computed with the Paris-Durham model. For the first time, we examine systematically the effect of the geometry, age, and various other parameters on the H2 excitation diagram and emission line profiles. Then, we will show that this 3D bow shock model unprecedentedly improves interpretations of the H2 observations inOrion BN-KL and BHR71, and show how spectral resolved H2 line emission profiles on the Herbig-Haro objects HH54 can be used to extract a wealth of dynamical information. In the second part, we model 1D steady stellar winds from AGB stars, which trigger the termination shock, by including relevant physical and chemical ingredients in the Paris-Durham code. For the first time, we examine the time-dependent conversion of atomic to molecular hydrogen along the wind trajectories of ``hot'' and ``cold'' AGB stars. We suggest that the low abundance of HI inferred from observations is due to hydrogen locked in its molecular form. Then, we try to reproduce HI 21-cm line profile in a ``hot'' AGB (called Y CVn) and a ``cold'' AGB (called CW Leo).},

  abstract      = {The equipartition of magnetic and thermal energy in interstellar medium (ISM) indicates the magneto-hydrodynamic nature of the interstellar turbulence, which can be decomposed into three wave modes: Alfv$\backslash$'en, fast and slow magnetosonic modes. Even for studies performed in the case of subsonic turbulence, the magnetosonic modes have been revealed to be more effective than the Alfv$\backslash$'enic modes for processes such as cosmic ray transport and acceleration. The multiphase nature of ISM and diversity of driving mechanisms give rise to spatial variation of turbulence properties. Nevertheless, the employed model of magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence is often oversimplified being assumed to be only Alfv$\backslash$'enic due to a lack of observational evidence to the contrary. Here we report the first use of our novel method, the signature from polarization analysis (SPA), on unveiling the plasma modes in interstellar turbulence. Its application leads to the first discovery of magnetosonic modes in the Orion Nebulae, Cygnus X region and Northern Galactic Halo. Through comparison with the spectrum at other wavelengths, our results unexpectedly disclose that active star formation zones are dominated by the magnetosonic modes. The SPA sheds light on the hitherto unknown plasma modes composition of the Galactic turbulence, and marks the onset of a new era in the study of interstellar turbulence and accordingly our understanding of star formation and cosmic ray transport.},

  abstract      = {We present results of the $^{12}$CO (1--0) mosaic observations of the nearby barred-spiral galaxy M83 obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The total flux is recovered by combining the ALMA data with single-dish data obtained using the Nobeyama 45-m telescope. The combined map covers a $\sim$13 kpc$^{2}$ field that includes the galactic center, eastern bar, and spiral arm with a resolution of $\backslash$timeform$\{$2''.03$\}$ $\times$ $\backslash$timeform$\{$1''.1$\}$ ($\sim$45 pc $\times$ $\sim$25 pc). With a resolution comparable to typical sizes of giant molecular clouds (GMCs), the CO distribution in the bar and arm is resolved into many clumpy peaks that form ridge-like structures. Remarkably, in the eastern arm, the CO peaks form two arc-shaped ridges that run along the arm and exhibit a distinct difference in the activity of star formation: the one on the leading side has numerous HII regions associated with it, whereas the other one on the trailing side has only a few. To see whether GMCs form stars with uniform star formation efficiency (SFE) per free-fall time (SFEff), GMCs are identified from the data cube and then cross-matched with the catalog of HII regions to estimate the star formation rate for each of them. 179 GMCs with a median mass of 1.6 $\times$ 10$^{6}$ $M\_{\odot}$ are identified. The mass-weighted average SFEff of the GMCs is $\sim$9.4 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$, which is in agreement with models of turbulence regulated star formation. Meanwhile, we find that SFEff is not universal within the mapped region. In particular, one of the arm ridges shows a high SFEff with a mass-weighted value of $\sim$2.7 $\times$ 10$^{-2}$, which is higher by more than a factor of 5 compared to the inter-arm regions. This large regional variation in SFEff favors the recent interpretation that GMCs do not form stars at a constant rate within their lifetime.},

  abstract      = {The large columns of dusty gas enshrouding and fuelling star-formation in young, massive stellar clusters may render such systems optically thick to radiation well into the infrared. This raises the prospect that both ``direct'' radiation pressure produced by absorption of photons leaving stellar surfaces and ``indirect'' radiation pressure from photons absorbed and then re-emitted by dust grains may be important sources of feedback in such systems. Here we evaluate this possibility by deriving the conditions under which a spheroidal, self-gravitating, mixed gas-star cloud can avoid catastrophic disruption by the combined effects of direct and indirect radiation pressure. We show that radiation pressure sets a maximum star cluster formation efficiency of $\epsilon\_{\rm max} \sim 0.9$ at a gas surface density of $\sim 10^5 M\_\odot$ pc$^{-2} (Z\_\odot/Z) \simeq 20$ g cm$^{-2} (Z\_\odot/Z)$, but that gas clouds above this limit undergo significant radiation-driven expansion during star formation, leading to a maximum stellar surface density very near this value for all star clusters. Data on the central surface mass density of compact stellar systems, while sparse and partly confused by dynamical effects, are broadly consistent with the existence of a metallicity-dependent upper-limit comparable to this value. Our results imply that this limit may preclude the formation of the progenitors of intermediate-mass black holes for systems with $Z \gtrsim 0.2 Z\_\odot$.},

Clean spectra were obtained towards 40 sources, yielding two new absorption detections, at $z = 0.229$ towards TXS 0003+380 and $z = 0.333$ towards TXS 1456+375, besides confirming an earlier detection, at $z = 1.277$ towards TXS 1543+480. There are 92 CJF sources, at $0.01 \lesssim z \lesssim 3.6$, with searches for associated HI 21-cm absorption, by far the largest uniformly-selected AGN sample with searches for such absorption. We find weak ($\approx 2\sigma$) evidence for a lower detection rate of HI 21-cm absorption at high redshifts, with detection rates of $28^{+10}\_{-8}$$\backslash$\% and $7^{+6}\_{-4}$$\backslash$\% in the low-$z$ ($z \lt z\_{\rm med}$) and high-$z$ ($z \gt z\_{\rm med}$) sub-samples, respectively. We use two-sample tests to find that the strength of the HI 21-cm absorption in the AGNs of our sample depends on both redshift and AGN luminosity, with a lower detection rate and weaker absorption at high redshifts and high ultraviolet/radio AGN luminosities. Unfortunately, the luminosity bias in our sample, with high-luminosity AGNs arising at high redshifts, implies that it is not currently possible to identify whether redshift evolution or AGN luminosity is the primary cause of the weaker absorption in high-$z$, high-luminosity AGNs. We find that the strength of HI 21-cm absorption does not depend on AGN colour, suggesting that dust extinction is not the main cause of reddening in the CJF sample.},

  abstract      = {Extragalactic astronomy relies on the accurate estimation of source photometry corrected for Milky Way dust extinction. This has motivated the creation of a number of ``Galactic'' dust maps. We investigate whether these maps are contaminated by extragalactic signals using the so-called clustering redshift technique, i.e. by measuring a set of angular cross-correlations with spectroscopic galaxies and quasars as a function of redshift. Our tomographic analysis reveals imprints of extragalactic large-scale structure patterns in 9 (out of 10) Galactic dust maps, including all infrared-based maps as well as ``stellar'' reddening maps. When such maps are used for extinction corrections, this extragalactic contamination introduces redshift- and scale-dependent biases in photometric estimates at the milli-magnitude level. It can affect both object-based analyses such as the estimation of the Hubble diagram with supernovae as well as spatial statistics. The bias can be appreciable when measuring angular correlation functions with low amplitudes such as lensing-induced correlations or angular correlations for sources distributed over a broad redshift range. As expected, we do not detect any extragalactic contamination for the dust map inferred from the distribution of HI from 21cm observations. Such a map provides an alternative to widely used infrared-based maps but relies on the assumption of a constant dust-to-gas ratio. We note that using the WISE 12 micron map sensitive to Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH), an indirect dust tracer, we detect the diffuse extragalactic PAH background up to $z\sim2$. For precision cosmology experiments using optical photometry, we recommend to test the robustness of the final results against different dust maps used. Finally, we provide a procedure to correct for or decrease the level of biased magnitude corrections in maps with extragalactic imprints.},

  abstract      = {To study some characteristics of the interstellar medium, observational data of pulsars with large Faraday rotation values (|RM|$\gt$ 300 rad / m2) were used. It was suggested and justified that large |RM| values can be due to the contribution of the regions with increased electron concentration, projected on the pulsar. Most likely these are the HII regions, dark nebulae and molecular clouds. In these objects the magnetic field can be oriented in the direction of a large-scale field of the Galaxy, or simply is a deformed extension of the galactic field. It was shown that the Galactic distribution of rotation measures of pulsars with |RM|$\gt$ 300rad / m2 corresponds to the circular model of the magnetic field of the Galaxy, with the counter-clockwise direction of the magnetic field in the galactocentric circle 5 kpc $\lt$R $\lt$7 kpc.},

  abstract      = {We study infrared emission of 17 isolated, diffuse clouds with masses of order solar masses, to test the hypothesis that grain property variations cause the apparently low gas-to-dust ratios that have been measured in those clouds. Maps of the clouds were constructed from WISE data and directly compared to the maps of dust optical depth from Planck. The mid-infrared emission per unit dust optical depth has a significant trend toward lower values at higher optical depths. The trend can be quantitatively explained by extinction of starlight within the clouds. The relative amounts of PAH and very small grains traced by WISE, compared to large grains tracked by Planck, are consistent with being constant. The temperature of the large grains significantly decreases for clouds with larger dust optical depth; this trend is partially due to dust property variations but is primarily due to extinction of starlight. We updated the prediction for molecular hydrogen column density, taking into account variations in dust properties, and find it can explain the observed dust optical depth per unit gas column density. Thus the low gas-to-dust ratios in the clouds are most likely due to `dark gas' that is molecular hydrogen.},

  abstract      = {Mergers of compact binaries (of a neutron star and another neutron star or a black hole; NSMs) are suggested to be the promising astropysical site of the r-process. While the average coalescence timescale of NSMs appears to be $\gt$ 100 Myr, most of previous chemical evolution models indicate that the observed early appearance and large dispersion of [r/Fe] in Galactic halo stars at [Fe/H] $\lt$ -2.5 favors shorter coalescence times of 1-10 Myr. We argue that this is not the case for the models assuming the formation of the Galactic halo from clustering of sub-halos with different star formation histories as suggested by Ishimaru et al. (2015). We present a stochastic chemical evolution model of the sub-halos, in which the site of the r-process is assumed to be mainly NSMs with a coalescence timescale of 100 Myr. In view of the scarcity of NSMs, their occurrence in each sub-halo is computed with a Monte-Carlo method. Our results show that the less massive sub-halos evolve at lower metallicities and generate highly r-process-enhanced stars. An assembly of these sub-halos leaves behind the large star-to-star scatters of [r/Fe] in the Galactic halo as observed. However, the observed scatters of [Sr/Ba] at low metallicities indicate the presence of an additional site that partially contributes to the enrichment of light neutron-capture elements such as Sr. The high enhancements of [r/Fe] at low metallicities found in our low-mass sub-halo models also qualitatively reproduce the abundance signatures of the stars in the recently discovered ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Reticulum II. Therefore, our results suggest NSMs as the dominant sources of r-process elements in the Galactic halo.},

The molecular line data reveal several dynamical features of the cores: (1) prominent outflows in all cores seen in the CO and SiO lines, (2) significant velocity gradients in Cyg-N43 and Cyg-N48 seen in the H13CN and H13CO+ lines suggesting 0.1-pc-scale rotational motions, and (3) possible infalls in Cyg-N48 found in the SiO and SO lines. Comparing the molecular line data and our dust polarization data in Ching et al. (2017), we find that the gradients of line-of-sight velocities appear to be randomly oriented relative to the plane-of-sky magnetic fields. Our simulations suggest that this random alignment implies parallel or random alignment between the velocity gradients and magnetic fields in the three dimensional space. The linewidths of H13CN emission are consistently wider than those of H13CO+ emission in the 3''-10'' detectable scales, which can be explained by the existence of ambipolar diffusion with maximum plane-of-the-sky magnetic field strengths of 1.9 mG and 5.1 mG in Cyg-N38 and Cyg-N48, respectively. Our results suggest that the gas dynamics may distort the magnetic fields of the cores of into complex structures and ambipolar diffusion could be important in dissipating the magnetic energies of the cores.},

The $\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$ $\{$$\{$II$\}$$\}$ regions are observed with a long-slit spectrograph mounted on the 2.16 m telescope at XingLong station of National Astronomical Observatories of China. For each of the $\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$ $\{$$\{$II$\}$$\}$ regions, spectra are extracted at different nebular radii along the slit-coverage. Oxygen abundances are empirically estimated from the strong-line indices R23, N2O2, O3N2, and N2 for each spectrophotometric unit, with both observation- and model-based calibrations adopted into the derivation. Radial profiles of these diversely estimated abundances are drawn for each nebula. In the results, the oxygen abundances separately estimated with the prescriptions on the basis of observations and models, albeit from the same spectral index, systematically deviate from each other; at the same time, the spectral indices R23 and N2O2 are distributed with flat profiles, whereas N2 and O3N2 exhibit apparent gradients with the nebular radius. Because our study naturally samples various ionization levels, which inherently decline at larger radii within individual $\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$ $\{$$\{$II$\}$$\}$ regions, the radial distributions indicate not only the robustness of R23 and N2O2 against ionization variations but also the sensitivity of N2 and O3N2 to the ionization parameter. The results in this paper provide observational corroboration of the theoretical prediction about the deviation in the empirical abundance diagnostics. Our future work is planned to investigate metal-poor $\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$ $\{$$\{$II$\}$$\}$ regions with measurable T $_{e}$, in an attempt to recalibrate the strong-line indices and consequently disclose the cause of the discrepancies between the empirical oxygen abundances.},

Clump formation is seeded in simulations via controlled perturbations with a specified wavelength and velocity. These are applied to otherwise quiet gas disks ranging from analogues of present day spirals to gas-rich, high-redshift galaxies. The results are compared to linear theory, turbulently perturbed disks and observations. The results reflect the expectations of linear, non-axisymmetric theory with a finite window for growth into a bound clump. We identify two new modes of clump formation: rotation-driven fission and fragmentation of tidal tails, though both are expected to rarely contribute to clump formation in observed disks. We find that bound clumps are generally much smaller than the so-called Toomre mass. The preferred scale for fragmentation increases with the disk gas mass but cannot produce bound objects larger than $\sim10^9$ M$\_{\odot}$. The most likely bound clump mass increases from $3\times10^6$ in low mass disks up to $5\times10^8$ M$\_{\odot}$. We conclude that observed massive stellar and gaseous clumps on 1 kpc scales at high redshift are most likely aggregates of many initially distinct bound clumps.},

The 37.7-GHz methanol sites are coincident to within the astrometric uncertainty (0.4 arcseconds) with the 6.7-GHz methanol masers associated with the same star formation region. However, spatial and spectral comparison of the 6.7- and 37.7-GHz maser emission within individual sources shows that the 37.7-GHz masers are less often, or to a lesser degree co-spatial than are the 12.2-GHz and 6.7-GHz masers. We also made sensitive, high angular resolution observations of the 38.3- and 38.5-GHz class II methanol transitions ($6\_{2} - 5\_{3}A^{-}$ and $6\_{2} - 5\_{3}A^{+}$, respectively) and the 36.2-GHz ($4\_{-1} - 3\_{0}E$) class I methanol transition towards the same sample of eleven sources. The 37.7-, 38.3- and 38.5-GHz methanol masers are unresolved in the current observations, which implies a lower limit on the brightness temperature of the strongest masers of more than $10^6$K. We detected the 38.3-GHz methanol transition towards 7 sources, 5 of which are new detections and detected the 38.5-GHz transition towards 6 sources, 4 of which are new detections.

Direct temperature measurements would put strong constraints on this issue. We carefully selected a sample of quiescent red sequence galaxies from SDSS. We bin them into three bins with different [N II]/H$\{$$\backslash$alpha$\}$ and [N II]/[O II] ratios, and we measure the temperature-sensitive [O III] $\{$$\backslash$lambda$\}$4363, [N II] $\{$$\backslash$lambda$\}$5755, [S II] $\{$$\backslash$lambda$\}$$\{$$\backslash$lambda$\}$4068,4076, and [O II] $\{$$\backslash$lambda$\}$$\{$$\backslash$lambda$\}$7320,7330 lines in the stacked spectra. The [S II] doublet ratios indicate the line-emitting gas is in the low density regime (\~{}10-100 cm$^{-3}$).We found the temperatures in the S+ zones to be around 8000K, the temperatures in the O+ zones to be around $1.1-1.5\times10^4$K, and the temperatures in the N+ zones to be around $1-1.4\times10^4$K. The [O III] $\{$$\backslash$lambda$\}$4363 line is not robustly detected. We found that the extinction corrections derived from Balmer decrements would yield unphysical relationships between the temperatures of the S+ zones and O+ zones, indicating that the extinction is significantly overestimated by the measured Balmer decrements. We compared these line ratios with model predictions for three ionization mechanisms: photoionization by hot evolved stars, shocks, and turbulent mixing layers. For both the photoionization and shock models, the hot temperatures inferred from [S II] and [N II] coronal-to-strong line ratios require metallicities to be significantly subsolar. However, the [N II]/[O II] line ratios require them to be supersolar. None of the models could simultaneously explain all of the observed line ratios, neither could their combinations do.},

The HI mass fraction below HI column densities of 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$ is, on average, 2$\backslash$\%. We discuss the possible origins of low column density HI of nearby spiral galaxies. The absence of a considerable amount of newly detected HI by the GBT indicates these galaxies do not have significant extended diffuse HI structures, and suggests future surveys planned with the SKA and its precursors must go $\backslash$textit$\{$at least$\}$ as deep as 10$^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$ in column density to significantly increase the probability of detecting HI associated with the cosmic web and/or cold mode accretion.},

These parameters agree with the values derived from optical and radio data, indicating no significant obscured star formation, absorption of photons by dust, or photon leakage. SSC-N and its nebulosity are an order of magnitude more massive and luminous than 30 Doradus and its ionizing cluster. Photoionization modeling suggests a high ionization parameter and a C/O ratio where C is between primary and secondary. We calculate diagnostic emission-line ratios and compare SSC-N to local star-forming galaxies. The SSC-N nebula does not coincide with the locus defined by local galaxies. Rather, it coincides with the location of ``Green Pea'' galaxies, objects which are often considered nearby analogs of the galaxies reionizing the universe. Most stellar features are well-reproduced by synthetic spectra. However, the SSC-N cluster has strong, broad, stellar He II 1640 emission that cannot be reproduced, suggesting a deficit of He-enhanced stars with massive winds in the models. We discuss possible sources for the broad He II emission, including very massive stars and/or enhanced mixing processes.},

  abstract      = {Massive stars are very rare, but their extreme luminosities make them both the only type of young star we can observe in distant galaxies and the dominant energy sources in the Universe today. They form rarely because efficient radiative cooling keeps most star-forming gas clouds close to isothermal as they collapse, and this favours fragmentation into stars of one solar mass or lower. Heating of a cloud by accreting low-mass stars within it can prevent fragmentation and allow formation of massive stars, but the necessary properties for a cloud to form massive stars-and therefore where massive stars form in a galaxy-have not yet been determined. Here we show that only clouds with column densities of at least 1gcm$^{-2}$ can avoid fragmentation and form massive stars. This threshold, and the environmental variation of the stellar initial mass function that it implies, naturally explain the characteristic column densities associated with massive star clusters and the difference between the radial profiles of H{$\alpha$} and ultraviolet emission in galactic disks. The existence of a threshold also implies that the initial mass function should show detectable variation with environment within the Galaxy, that the characteristic column densities of clusters containing massive stars should vary between galaxies, and that star formation rates in some galactic environments may have been systematically underestimated.},

These objects are bright in molecular hydrogen (H2) emission, and many have bipolar morphologies. Through the detection of the Br$\{$$\backslash$gamma$\}$ emission line, which traces ionized hydrogen, we find that the majority of the candidate PNe are indeed likely to be PNe, while 2 of the targets are more likely young stellar objects (YSOs) or pre-planetary nebulae (pPNe). We detect Br$\{$$\backslash$gamma$\}$ in 13 objects which have no detection in IPHAS or SHS H$\{$$\backslash$alpha$\}$ surveys. This implies they are potential members of the little-known optically-obscured PN population, hidden from wide-field optical surveys. We use the spatial extent of the H2 1-0 S(1) and Br$\{$$\backslash$gamma$\}$ lines to estimate the evolutionary stage of our targets, and find that W-BPNe (bipolar PNe with pinched waist morphologies) are likely to be younger objects, while R-BPNe (bipolar PNe with large ring structures) are more evolved. We use line ratios to trace the excitation mechanism of the H2, and find the 1-0 S(1) / 2-1 S(1) and 1-0 S(1) / Br$\{$$\backslash$gamma$\}$ ratios are higher for R-BPNe, implying the H2 is thermally excited. However, in W-BPNe, these ratios are lower, and so UV-fluorescence may be contributing to the excitation of H2.},

We combine the star cluster catalog from the HST LEGUS (Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey) program with the 15 parsec resolution ALMA CO(2-1) observations. We find a strong spatial correlation between young star clusters and GMCs such that all clusters still associated with a GMC are younger than 11 Myr and display a median age of 2 Myr. The age distribution increases gradually as the cluster-GMC distance increases, with star clusters that are spatially unassociated with molecular gas exhibiting a median age of 7 Myr. Thus, star clusters are able to emerge from their natal clouds long before the timescale required for clouds to disperse. To investigate if the hierarchy observed in the stellar components is inherited from the GMCs, we quantify the amount of clustering in the spatial distributions of the components and find that the star clusters have a fractal dimension slope of $-0.35 \pm 0.03$, significantly more clustered than the molecular cloud hierarchy with slope of $-0.18 \pm 0.04$ over the range 40-800 pc. We find, however, that the spatial clustering becomes comparable in strength for GMCs and star clusters with slopes of $-0.44\pm0.03$ and $-0.45\pm0.06$ respectively, when we compare massive ($\gt$10$^5$ M$\_{\odot}$) GMCs to massive and young star clusters. This shows that massive star clusters trace the same hierarchy as their parent GMCs, under the assumption that the star formation efficiency is a few percent.},

  abstract      = {We present a 3x3 degrees, 105-pointing, high-resolution neutral hydrogen (HI) mosaic of the M81 galaxy triplet (including the galaxies M81, M82 and NGC 3077, as well as dwarf galaxy NGC 2976) obtained with the Very Large Array (VLA) C and D arrays. This uniformly covers the entire area and velocity range of the triplet with a resolution of \~{}20'' or \~{}420 pc. The data reveal many small-scale anomalous velocity features highlighting the complexity of the interacting M81 triplet. We compare our data with Green Bank Telescope (GBT) observations of the same area. This provides evidence for a substantial reservoir of low-column density gas in the northern part of the triplet, probably associated with M82. Such a reservoir is not found in the southern part. We report a number of kpc-sized low-mass HI clouds with HI masses of a few times 10\^{}6 Msun. Their dynamical masses are much larger than their baryonic masses, which could indicate the presence of dark matter if the clouds are rotationally supported. However, due to their spatial and kinematical association with HI tidal features, it is more likely that the velocity widths indicate tidal effects or streaming motions. We do not find any clouds not associated with tidal features down to an HI mass limit of a few times 10\^{}4 Msun. We compare the HI column densities with resolved stellar density maps and find a star formation threshold around 3-6 10\^{}20 cm-2$. We find that extreme velocity dispersions can be explained by a superposition of multiple components along the line of sight near M81 as well as winds or outflows around M82. The velocity dispersions found are high enough that these processes could explain the linewidths of Damped-Lyman-alpha absorbers observed at high redshift.},

  abstract      = {The multifractal geometry remains an under-exploited approach to describe and quantify the large-scale structure of interstellar clouds. In this paper, the typical tools of multifractal analysis are applied to Herschel far-infrared (70-500 $\mu$m) dust continuum maps, which represent an ideal case of study. This dust component is a relatively optically thin tracer at these wavelengths and the size in pixel of the maps is well suitable for this statistical analysis. We investigate the so-called multifractal spectrum and generalised fractal dimension of six Hi-GAL regions in the third Galactic quadrant. We measure systematic variations of the spectrum at increasing wavelength, which generally correspond to an increasing complexity of the image, and we observe peculiar behaviours of the investigated fields, strictly related to the presence of high-emission regions, which in turn are connected to star formation activity. The same analysis is applied to synthetic column density maps, generated from numerical turbulent molecular cloud models and from fractal Brownian motion (fBm), allowing for the confrontation of the observations with models with well controlled physical parameters. This comparison shows that, in terms of multifractal descriptors of the structure, fBm images exhibit a very different, quite unrealistic behaviour when compared with Hi-GAL observations, whereas the numerical simulations appear in some cases (depending on the specific model) more similar to the observations. Finally, the link between mono-fractal parameters (commonly found in the literature) and multifractal indicators is investigated: the former appear to be only partially connected with the latter, with the multifractal analysis offering a more extended and complete characterization of the cloud structure.},

  abstract      = {Cosmic dust is a key tracer of structure formation and evolution in the universe. In active galactic nuclei (AGN) the origin and role of dust are uncertain. Here, we have studied dust in the X-ray bright and reddened type-1 quasar IC 4329A, which exhibits an ionised AGN wind. We incorporated high-resolution X-ray and mid-IR spectroscopy, combined with broad-band continuum modelling, to investigate the properties of dust in this AGN. We used new Chandra HETGS observations taken in June 2017, as well as archival data from XMM-Newton, Swift, HST, Spitzer, IRAS, and Herschel for our IR-optical-UV-X-ray modelling. Two distinct components of dust in IC 4329A are found. One component is in the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy, and the other is a nuclear component in the AGN torus and its associated wind. The emitting dust in the torus is evident in mid-IR emission (9.7 and 18 micron features), while dust in the wind is present through both reddening and X-ray absorption (O, Si, and Fe edge features). The gas depletion factors into dust for O, Si, and Fe are measured. We derive an intrinsic reddening E(B-V) \~{} 1.0, which is most consistent with a grey (flat) extinction law. The AGN wind consists of three ionisation components. From analysis of long-term changes in the wind, we determine limits on the location of the wind components. The two lowest ionisation components are likely carriers of dust from the AGN torus. We find that the dust in the nuclear component of IC 4329A is different from dust in the Milky Way. The dust grains in the AGN torus and wind are likely larger than the standard Galactic dust, and are in a porous composite form (containing amorphous silicate with iron and oxygen). This can be a consequence of grain coagulation in the dense nuclear environment of the AGN.},

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations taken as part of the CO Luminosity Density at High Redshift (COLDz) survey. COLDz ``blindly'' selects galaxies based on their cold gas content through CO($J$=1$\to$0) emission at $z$$\sim$2-3 and CO($J$=2$\to$1) at $z$$\sim$5-7. We find that the characteristic luminosity and bright end of the CO luminosity function are substantially higher than predicted by semi-analytical models, but consistent with empirical estimates based on the infrared luminosity function at $z$$\sim$2. We also present the currently most reliable measurement of the cosmic density of cold gas in galaxies at early epochs, i.e., the cold gas history of the universe, as determined over a large cosmic volume of $\sim$375,000 Mpc$^3$. Our measurements are in agreement with an increase of the cold gas density from $z$$\sim$0 to $z$$\sim$2-3, followed by a possible decline towards $z$$\sim$5-7. These findings are consistent with recent surveys based on higher-$J$ CO line measurements, upon which COLDz improves in terms of statistical uncertainties by probing $\sim$50-100 times larger areas and in the reliability of total gas mass estimates by probing the low-$J$ CO lines accessible to the VLA. Our results thus appear to suggest that the cosmic star-formation rate density follows an increased cold molecular gas content in galaxies towards its peak about 10 billion years ago, and that its decline towards the earliest epochs is likely related to a lower overall amount of cold molecular gas (as traced by CO) bound in galaxies towards the first billion years after the Big Bang.},

The main goal of COLDz is to constrain the cosmic density of molecular gas at the peak epoch of cosmic star formation. By targeting both a wide ($\sim$51 arcmin$^2$) and a deep area ($\sim$9 arcmin$^2$), the survey is designed to robustly constrain the bright end and the characteristic luminosity of the CO(1-0) luminosity function. An extensive analysis of the reliability of our line candidates, and new techniques provide detailed completeness and statistical corrections as necessary to determine the best constraints to date on the CO luminosity function. Our blind search for CO(1-0) uniformly selects starbursts and massive Main Sequence galaxies based on their cold molecular gas masses. Our search also detects CO(2-1) line emission from optically dark, dusty star-forming galaxies at $z\gt5$. We find a range of spatial sizes for the CO-traced gas reservoirs up to $\sim40$ kpc, suggesting that spatially extended cold molecular gas reservoirs may be common in massive, gas-rich galaxies at $z\sim2$. Through CO line stacking, we constrain the gas mass fraction in previously known typical star-forming galaxies at $z=2$-3. The stacked CO detection suggests lower molecular gas mass fractions than expected for massive Main Sequence galaxies by a factor of $\sim3-6$. We find total CO line brightness at $\sim34\,$GHz of $0.45\pm0.2\,\mu$K, which constrains future line intensity mapping and CMB experiments.},

We found that the motion in both star-forming knots of UM 461 has different patterns, suggesting a weak kinematical connection between the knots. The overall kinematics of the galaxy is probably affected by stellar feedback. CTS 1020 has an ordered motion with a gradient compatible with a disc rotating at $\sim50$ km s$^{-1}$, though the velocity field is disturbed. In both galaxies the highest and lowest $\sigma$ values are distributed in the outer parts and are associated with the diffuse gas that permeates the galaxies. UM 461 has a ring-like structure with small regions of increasing $\sigma$ in the eastern knot, which resemble what we could expect in a collect and collapse scenario of star formation. We found that UM 461 seems to be more susceptible to stellar feedback, whereas in CTS 1020 the gravitational potential dominates.},

  abstract      = {I conduct simple analytical estimates and conclude that mixing by vortices is a more efficient process to transfer the cosmic ray energy of jet-inflated bubbles to the intracluster medium (ICM) than streaming of cosmic rays along magnetic field lines. Jets and the bubbles they inflate transfer heat to the ambient gas in cooling flows in cluster of galaxies and in galaxies. The internal energy of the jet-inflated bubbles is dominate by very hot thermal gas and/or cosmic rays. Cosmic rays that stream along magnetic field lines that connect the bubbles with the ICM heat the ICM as their energy is dissipated there. I find that about half of the cosmic ray energy is dissipated in the bubbles themselves. I also find that the ICM volume that the cosmic ray streaming process heats is only about five times as large as the volume of the bubbles. The outcome of heating by streaming only is that the cosmic rays form a larger bubble filled with very hot thermal gas. Therefore, there is a requirement for a more efficient process to transfer the internal energy of the bubbles to the ICM. I suggest that this process is heating by mixing that operates very well for both cosmic rays and the very hot thermal gas inside the bubbles. This leaves mixing-heating to be the dominant heating process of cooling flows.},

We used published cold gas observations through PLANCK survey data processing, HERSCHEL and APEX, continuum and molecular line observations. We analysed the Galactic All Sky Survey (GASS) to investigate shell structures in atomic hydrogen, and used HIPPARCOS and Gaia data in combination with interstellar absorption against stars to obtain new constraints for the distance to the Hi features. Hot gas is traced in soft X-rays via the ROSAT all sky survey. Nucleosynthesis ejecta from massive stars were traced with new INTEGRAL spectrometer observations via 26Al radioactivity. We also performed 3D hydrodynamical simulations for the Sco-Cen superbubble. To investigate the impact of massive star feedback on extended clouds, we simulate the interaction of a turbulent cloud with the hot, pressurised gas in a superbubble. The hot gas fills the tenuous regions of the cloud and compresses the denser parts. Stars formed in these dense clumps would have distinct spatial and kinematic distributions. The combined results from observations and simulations are consistent with a scenario where dense gas was initially distributed in a band elongated in the direction now occupied by the OB association. Superbubbles powered by massive stars would then repeatedly break out of the elongated parent cloud, surround and squash the denser parts of the gas sheet and thus induce more star formation. The expected spatial and kinematic distribution of stars is consistent with observations of Sco-Cen. The scenario might apply to many similar regions in the Galaxy and also to AGN-related superbubbles.},

  abstract      = {We revisit the interpretation of blue-excess molecular lines from dense collapsing cores, considering recent numerical results that suggest prestellar core collapse occurs from the outside-in, and not inside-out. We thus create synthetic molecular-line observations of simulated collapsing, spherically-symmetric, density fluctuations of low initial amplitude, embedded in a uniform, globally gravitationally unstable background, without a turbulent component. The collapsing core develops a flattened, Bonnor-Ebert-like density profile, but with an outside-in radial velocity profile, where the peak infall speeds are at large radii, in lower density gas, with cloud-to-core accretion, and no hydrostatic outer envelope. Using optically thick HCO$^+$ J=1-0 and 3-2 rotational lines, we consider several ``typical'' beamwidths and use a simple line-fitting model to infer infall speeds from the synthetic profiles similarly to what is done in standard line modeling. We find that the inferred infall speeds are \~{} 25-30\% of the actual peak infall speed as the largest speeds are downweighted by the low density gas in which they occur, due to the outside-in nature of the actual radial collapse profile. Also, with the N$\_2$H$^+$ $J\_{F\_1F}=1\_{01}-0\_{12}$ hyperfine line, we investigate the change in the asymmetry parameter, $\delta v\equiv(V\_{thick}-V\_{thin})/\Delta v\_{thin}$, during the collapse, finding good agreement with observed values. Finally, the HCO$^+$ J=3-2 lines exhibit extreme $T\_b$/$T\_r$-ratios like those for evolved cores, for larger beams late in the collapse. Our results suggest that standard dynamical infall reproduces several observed features, but that low-mass core infall speeds are generally undervalued, often interpreted as being subsonic although the actual speeds are supersonic, due to incorrectly assuming an inside-out infall radial velocity profile with a static outer envelope.},

On average, the 43 GHz v=1 line is brighter than the 86 GHz v=1 line by a factor of 1.36+/-0.15. As a result, an 86 GHz v=1 observed sample can be observed to 85.9\% of the distance of a 43 GHz v=1 observed sample using the same sensitivity. We discuss what impact this may have on the BAaDE Galactic plane survey using the VLA and ALMA. Despite fewer v=3 detections, specific trends are discerned or strengthened when the 43 GHz v=3 line is detected. In particular the 43 and 86 GHz v=1 lines are on average equal for sources with no detectable 43 GHz v=3 emission, but the 43 GHz v=1 line strength is on average about twice as bright as the 86 GHz v=1 line for sources with detectable 43 GHz v=3 emission. Some weak correlations are found between line strengths and Midcourse Space Experiment flux densities and colors, which are tightened when considering only sources with detectable 43 GHz v=3 emission. We discuss these trends in the context of a radiative pumping model to highlight how the 43 GHz v=3 line, when coupled with the v=1 and v=2 lines, can further our understanding of variable conditions like density in the circumstellar envelopes.},

The star-formation rates of these galaxies, which exceed 100 solar masses per year, require large reservoirs of cold molecular gas to be delivered to their cores, despite strong feedback from stars or active galactic nuclei. Consequently, starburst galaxies are ideal for studying the interplay between this feedback and the growth of a galaxy. The methylidyne cation, CH$^{+}$, is a most useful molecule for such studies because it cannot form in cold gas without suprathermal energy input, so its presence indicates dissipation of mechanical energy or strong ultraviolet irradiation. Here we report the detection of CH$^{+}$ (J{\thinsp}={\thinsp}1-0) emission and absorption lines in the spectra of six lensed starburst galaxies at redshifts near 2.5. This line has such a high critical density for excitation that it is emitted only in very dense gas, and is absorbed in low-density gas. We find that the CH$^{+}$ emission lines, which are broader than 1,000 kilometres per second, originate in dense shock waves powered by hot galactic winds. The CH$^{+}$ absorption lines reveal highly turbulent reservoirs of cool (about 100 kelvin), low-density gas, extending far (more than 10 kiloparsecs) outside the starburst galaxies (which have radii of less than 1 kiloparsec). We show that the galactic winds sustain turbulence in the 10-kiloparsec-scale environments of the galaxies, processing these environments into multiphase, gravitationally bound reservoirs. However, the mass outflow rates are found to be insufficient to balance the star-formation rates. Another mass input is therefore required for these reservoirs, which could be provided by ongoing mergers or cold-stream accretion. Our results suggest that galactic feedback, coupled jointly to turbulence and gravity, extends the starburst phase of a galaxy instead of quenching it.},

  abstract      = {Cosmic rays are predominantly accelerated in shocks associated with star formation such as supernova remnants and stellar wind bubbles, so the cosmic-ray flux and thus cosmic-ray ionization rate, $\zeta\_{\rm H}$, should correlate with the star-formation rate in a galaxy. Submillimeter bright galaxies (SMGs) are some of the most prolific star forming galaxies in the Universe, and gravitationally lensed SMGs provide bright continuum sources suitable for absorption line studies. Abundances of OH$^+$ and H$\_2$O$^+$ are useful for inferring $\zeta\_{\rm H}$ when combined with chemical models, and have been used for this purpose within the Milky Way. At redshifts $z\gtrsim2$ transitions out of the ground rotational states of OH$^+$ and H$\_2$O$^+$ are observable with ALMA, and we present observations of both molecules in absorption toward the lensed SMGs SMM J2135$-$0102 and SDP 17b. These detections enable an exploration of $\zeta\_{\rm H}$ in galaxies with extreme star formation and high supernova rates, both of which should significantly enhance cosmic-ray production. The observed OH$^+$ and H$\_2$O$^+$ absorption is thought to arise in massive, extended halos of cool, diffuse gas that surround these galaxies. Using a chemical model designed to focus on the reaction network important to both species, we infer cosmic-ray ionization rates of $\zeta\_{\rm H}\sim10^{-16}$-$10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$ in these extended gaseous halos. As our estimates come from gas that is far away from the sites of cosmic-ray acceleration, they imply that cosmic-ray ionization rates in the compact regions where star formation occurs in these galaxies are orders of magnitude higher.},

Small-scale galactic magnetic fields (1 kpc and below) can be generated by tangling the large-scale field or by the small-scale turbulent dynamo. The analysis of field structures with the help of polarized radio continuum emission is hampered by the effect of Faraday dispersion (due to fluctuations in magnetic field and/or thermal electron density) that shifts signals from large to small scales. At long observation wavelengths large-scale magnetic fields may become invisible, as in the case of spectro-polarimetric data cube of the spiral galaxy NGC\~{}6946 observed with the Westerbork Radio Synthesis Telescope in the wavelength range 17-23 cm. The application of RM Synthesis alone does not overcome this problem. We propose to decompose the Faraday data cube into data cubes at different spatial scales by a wavelet transform. Signatures of the `magnetic arms' observed in NGC\~{}6946 at shorter wavelengths become visible. Our method allows us to search for large-scale field patterns in data cubes at long wavelengths, as provided by new-generation radio telescopes.},

The IPHAS images reveal H$\alpha$ emission at various locations around PG108.3, and optical spectroscopy of the bright sources in those zones of H$\alpha$ emission disclose two massive ionizing sources with spectral type O8-O9V and B1V. Using the radio continuum, we estimate ionizing gas parameters and find the dynamical ages of $\backslash$hii regions associated with the massive stars in the range 0.5$-$0.75 Myr. Based on the stellar surface density map constructed from the deep near-infrared CHFT observations, we find two prominent star clusters in PG108.3; of which, the cluster associated with $\backslash$hii region S148 is moderately massive ($\sim$ 240 M$\sun$). A careful inspection of JCMT $^{13}$CO(3$-$2) molecular data exhibits that the massive cluster is associated with a number of filamentary structures. Several embedded young stellar objects (YSOs) are also identified in the PG108.3 along the length and junction of filaments. We find the evidence of velocity gradient along the length of the filaments. Along with kinematics of the filaments and the distribution of ionized, molecular gas and YSOs, we suggest that the cluster formation is most likely due to the longitudinal collapse of the most massive filament in PG108.3.},

Using three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the supernova (SN) driven ISM in the flux-freezing approximation (ideal MHD) we investigate the impact of the magnetic field on the chemical and dynamical evolution of the gas, fragmentation and the formation of molecular clouds. We follow the chemistry with a network of six species (H$^{+}$, H, H$\_2$, C$^+$, CO, free electrons) including local shielding effects. We find that magnetic fields thicken the disc by a factor of a few to a scale height of $\sim100\,\mathrm{pc}$, delay the formation of dense (and molecular) gas by $\sim25\,\mathrm{Myr}$ and result in differently shaped gas structures. The magnetised gas fragments into fewer clumps, which are initially at subcritical mass-to-flux ratios, $M/\Phi\approx0.3(M/\Phi)\_\mathrm{crit}$, and accrete gas preferentially parallel to the magnetic field lines until supercritial mass-to-flux ratios of up to order 10 are reached. The accretion rates onto molecular clouds scale with $\dot{M}\propto M^{1.5}$. The median of the inter-cloud velocity dispersion is $\sim2-5\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ and lower than the internal velocity dispersion in the clouds ($\sim3-7\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$). However, individual cloud-cloud collisions occur at speeds of a few $10\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$.},

  abstract      = {We study an idealized 1D model for the evolution of hot gas in dark matter halos for redshifts $z=[0,6]$. We introduce a numerical setup incorporating cosmological accretion of gas, along with the growth of the halo, based on the Van den Bosch model for the average growth of halos as a function of cosmic time. We evolve one-dimensional Lagrangian shells with radiative cooling of the gas and heating due to feedback from the gas cooling and moving in toward the center. A simple Bondi accretion model on to a central black hole is used to include feedback. The setup captures some of the key characteristics of spherically symmetric accretion onto the halos: formation of virial shocks slightly outside $r\_{200}$ and long-term thermal balance in the form of cooling and heating cycles. The gas density outside our initial halos at $z=6$ is constrained by requiring that the baryon fraction within the virial radius for adiabatic conditions be equal to the universal value at almost all times. The total mass in the cold phase ($\sim 10^4$ K) within $40$ kpc is tracked as a function of the halo mass and redshift. We compare the evolution of the cold gas mass to the observed stellar-mass versus halo mass relations, following which, we can constrain the feedback energy required for different halo masses and redshifts. We also compare and match the hot gas density and temperature profiles for the most massive halo in our model to those observed recently for redshifts upto $2$. Our model is thus an improvement over the semi-analytic models in which isothermal condition and $\rho \propto r^{-2}$ are assumed.},

We provide the first statistically meaningful sample of $\tau\_{\rm eff}$ measurements in six science-grade (signal-to-noise ratio $\gtrsim 3$) HeII sightlines at $z\gt3.5$, and combine them with our previous results at lower redshifts to study the redshift evolution of $\tau\_{\rm eff}$ in 24 HeII sightlines. We confirm that the median $\tau\_{\rm eff}$ increases from $\simeq 2$ at $z=2.7$ to a limit $\tau\_{\rm eff}\gtrsim 5$ at $z\gt3$, and that the scatter in $\tau\_{\rm eff}$ increases with redshift. At $z\gt3.5$ we observe predominantly saturated HeII absorption, but several isolated narrow transmission spikes indicate patches of fully reionized helium at these early epochs. We statistically compare our measurements to predictions for a range of UV background models applied to outputs of a large-volume hydrodynamical simulation by forward-modeling the quality and size of our sample. At $z\gt2.74$ the variance in the observed $\tau\_{\rm eff}$ significantly exceeds expectations for a spatially uniform HeII-ionizing background, but is in good agreement with a fluctuating radiation field. We develop a method to infer the approximate median HeII photoionization rate $\Gamma\_{\rm HeII}$ of a fluctuating UV background from the median $\tau\_{\rm eff}$, finding it to monotonically decrease by a factor $\simeq 5$ from $z\simeq 2.6$ to $z\simeq 3.1$. At $z\simeq 3.1$ our inferred $\Gamma\_{\rm HeII}$ corresponds to a median HeII fraction of $\simeq 2.5$$\backslash$\%, indicating that our observations probe the tail end of HeII reionization when UV background fluctuations gradually diminished.},

The $\kappa$ index of $0.78 \pm 0.10$ was obtained toward the starless dense core FeSt 1-457 based on the analysis of the radial distribution of the polarization angle dispersion of background stars measured at the near-infrared wavelengths. The result prefers $\kappa = 2/3$ for the case of isotropic contraction, and the difference of the observed value from $\kappa = 1/2$ is 2.8 sigma. The distribution of the ratio of mass to magnetic flux was evaluated. FeSt 1-457 was found to be magnetically supercritical near the center ($\lambda \approx 2$), whereas nearly critical or slightly subcritical at the core boundary ($\lambda \approx 0.98$). Ambipolar-diffusion-regulated star formation models for the case of moderate magnetic field strength may explain the physical status of FeSt 1-457. The mass-to-flux ratio distribution for typical dense cores (critical Bonnor--Ebert sphere with central $\lambda=2$ and $\kappa=1/2$--$2/3$) was calculated and found to be magnetically critical/subcritical at the core edge, which indicates that typical dense cores are embedded in and evolve from magnetically critical/subcritical diffuse surrounding medium.},

This has allowed, for the first time, a direct comparison of the thermal water in this outflow to the location of water maser emission from prior 22 GHz VLA observations. The maser locations are shown to correspond to the sites along the outflow cavity walls where high velocity gas impacts the surrounding material.

We show that the simulated galaxies follow this relation from their formation ($z\simeq4$) to present within $\sim 0.5$ dex. To explain this behavior, we explore the evolution of the local Toomre stability and find that $90\\%$--$100\\%$ of the atomic gas in all simulated galaxies is stable at any time. In other words, throughout the entire epoch of peak star formation until today, the timescale for accretion is longer than the timescale to reach equilibrium, thus resulting in a quasi-static equilibrium of atomic gas at any time. Hence, the evolution of $f\_{\rm atm}$ depends on the complex hierarchical growth history primarily via the evolution of $q$. An exception are galaxies subject to strong environmental effects.},

We confirm that the flux-ratio anomalies observed in the mid-infrared and radio persists into the sub-mm for the continuum images of the quasar. We report the detection of CO (11-10) spectral line emission, which traces a region of compact gas around the quasar nucleus. This line emission also shows evidence of a flux-ratio anomaly between the merging lensed images that is consistent with those observed at other wavelengths, suggesting high-excitation CO can also provide a useful probe of substructures that is unaffected by microlensing or dust extinction. However, we do not detect the candidate dusty dwarf galaxy that was previously reported with this dataset, which we conclude is due to a noise artefact. Thus, the cause of the flux-ratio anomaly between the merging lensed images is still unknown. The composite compact and diffuse emission in this system suggest lensed quasar-starbursts will make excellent targets for detecting dark sub-haloes and testing models for dark matter.},

The two clouds exhibit significant differences in terms of column density and polarization properties. Their mean plane-of-the-sky magnetic field orientation differs by 60 degrees. We show how our tomographic decomposition can be used to constrain our estimates of the polarizing efficiency of the clouds as well as the frequency dependence of the polarization angle of polarized dust emission.

  abstract      = {We present further results of a survey for absorption line systems in the spectra of four high redshift quasars (5.79 $\le$ z$\_{\textrm{em}}$ $\le$ 6.13) obtained with the ESO Very Large Telescope X-Shooter. We identify 36 $\textrm{CIV}$ and 7 $\textrm{SiIV}$ systems with a $\ge$ 5$\sigma$ significance. The highest redshift $\textrm{CIV}$ and $\textrm{SiIV}$ absorbers identified in this work are at z = 5.80738 $\pm$ 0.00017 and z = 5.77495 $\pm$ 0.00038, respectively. We compute the comoving mass density of $\textrm{SiIV}$ ($\Omega\_{\textrm{SiIV}}$) and find that it evolves from $\Omega\_{\textrm{SiIV}}$ = 4.3$^{+2.1}\_{-2.1}$ $\times$10$^{-9}$ at $\lt$z$\gt$ = 5.05 to $\Omega\_{\textrm{SiIV}}$ = 1.4$^{+0.6}\_{-0.4}$ $\times$10$^{-9}$ at $\lt$z$\gt$ = 5.66. We also measure $\Omega\_{\textrm{CIV}}$ = 1.6$^{+0.4}\_{-0.1}$ $\times$10$^{-8}$ at $\lt$z$\gt$ = 4.77 and $\Omega\_{\textrm{CIV}}$ = 3.4$^{+1.6}\_{-1.1}$ $\times$10$^{-9}$ at $\lt$z$\gt$ = 5.66. We classify our $\textrm{CIV}$ absorber population by the presence of associated $\textit{low}$ and/or $\textit{high ionisation}$ systems and compute their velocity width ($\Delta$v$\_{90}$). We find that all $\textrm{CIV}$ systems with $\Delta$v$\_{90}$ $\gt$ 200 kms$^{-1}$ have associated $\textit{low ionisation}$ systems. We investigate two such systems, separated by 550 physical kpc along a line of sight, and find it likely that they are both tracing a multi-phase medium where hot and cold gas is mixing at the interface between the CGM and IGM. We further discuss the $\backslash$textrm$\{$MgII$\}$ systems presented in a previous work and we identify 5 $\textrm{SiII}$, 10 $\textrm{AlII}$, 12 $\textrm{FeII}$, 1 $\textrm{CII}$, 7 $\textrm{MgI}$ and 1 $\textrm{CaII}$ associated transitions. We compute the respective comoving mass densities in the redshift range 2 to 6, as allowed by the wavelength coverage.},

  abstract      = {Eleven nearby ($\lt$300 pc), short-period (50-130 days) asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars were observed in the CO J = (2-1) line. Detections were made towards objects that have evidence for dust production (Ks-[22] $\gt$\~{} 0.55 mag; AK Hya, V744 Cen, RU Crt, alpha Her). Stars below this limit were not detected (BQ Gem, eps Oct, NU Pav, II Hya, CL Hyi, ET Vir, SX Pav). Ks-[22] colour is found to trace mass-loss rate to well within an order of magnitude. This confirms existing results, indicating a factor of 100 increase in AGB-star mass-loss rates at a pulsation period of \~{}60 days, similar to the known ``superwind'' trigger at \~{}300 days. Between \~{}60 and \~{}300 days, an approximately constant mass-loss rate and wind velocity of \~{}3.7 x 10\^{}-7 solar masses per year and \~{}8 km/s is found. While this has not been corrected for observational biases, this rapid increase in mass-loss rate suggests a need to recalibrate the treatment of AGB mass loss in stellar evolution models. The comparative lack of correlation between mass-loss rate and luminosity (for L $\lt$\~{} 6300 solar luminosities) suggests that the mass-loss rates of low-luminosity AGB-star winds are set predominantly by pulsations, not radiation pressure on dust, which sets only the outflow velocity. We predict that mass-loss rates from low-luminosity AGB stars, which exhibit optically thin winds, should be largely independent of metallicity, but may be strongly dependent on stellar mass.},

  abstract      = {Molecular clouds exhibit lognormal probability density functions (PDF) of mass densities, which are thought to arise as a consequence of isothermal, supersonic turbulence. Star formation is then widely assumed to occur in perturbations in which gravitational collapse is faster than the rate of change due to turbulent motions. Here we use direct numerical simulations to measure this rate as a function of density for a range of turbulent Mach numbers, and show it is faster at high densities than at low densities. Furthermore, we show that both the density PDF and rate of change arise naturally in a simple model of turbulence as a continuous Markov process. The one-dimensional Langevin equation that describes this evolution depends on only two parameters, yet it captures the full evolution seen in direct three-dimensional simulations. If it is modified to include gravity, the Langevin equation also reproduces the rate of material collapsing to high densities seen in turbulent simulations including self-gravity. When generalized to include both temperature and density, similar analyses are likely applicable throughout astrophysics.},

  abstract      = {The composition of the astrophysical relativistic jets remains uncertain. By kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we show that the baryon component in the jet, or the so-called baryon loading effect (BLE), heavily affects relativistic jets transport dynamics in the interstellar medium. On the one hand, with the BLE, relativistic jets can transport in a much longer distance, because jet electrons draw a significant amount of energy from jet baryons via the Buneman-induced electrostatic waves and the Weibel-mediated collisionless shock; on the other hand, the jet electron phase space distribution may transform from a bottom-wide-single-peak structure to a center-wide-multiple-peak one by increasing the BLE, which largely influences the observed jet morphology. Implications for related astrophysical studies are also discussed.},

  abstract      = {Cosmic-ray (CR) induced heating of whole interstellar grains is an important desorption mechanism for grain surface molecules in interstellar molecular clouds. This study aims to provide a detailed temperature spectra for such CR-induced heating. For this, olivine grains with radius of 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 microns shielded by interstellar gas with isotropic column densities characteristic to dark cores were considered. The accumulation of an ice mantle of increasing thickness was taken into account. The CR energy spectra was obtained for these column densities for 32 cosmic-ray constituents. We calculated the frequencies with which a CR nucleus with a known energy hits a grain, depositing a certain amount of energy. As a result, we obtain the energy and temperature spectra for grains affected by CR hits. This allows to improve the existing approaches on CR-induced whole-grain heating in astrochemical modeling.},
