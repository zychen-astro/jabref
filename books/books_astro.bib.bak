  abstract  = {Distant galaxies encapsulate the various stages of galaxy evolution and formation from over 95\% of the development of the universe. As early as twenty-five years ago, little was known about them, however since the first systematic survey was completed in the 1990s, increasing amounts of resources have been devoted to their discovery and research. This book summarises for the first time the numerous techniques used for observing, analysing, and understanding the evolution and formation of these distant galaxies. In this rapidly expanding research field, this text is an every-day companion handbook for graduate students and active researchers. It provides guidelines in sample selection, imaging, integrated spectroscopy and 3D spectroscopy, which help to avoid the numerous pitfalls of observational and analysis techniques in use in extragalactic astronomy. It also paves the way for establishing relations between fundamental properties of distant galaxies. At each step, the reader is assisted with numerous practical examples and ready-to-use methodology to help understand and analyse research.},

  abstract  = {Different structural parameter correlations show how classical bulge components and elliptical galaxies are different from spiral and S0 galaxy disks, irregular (Im) galaxies, and spheroidal (Sph) galaxies. In contrast, the latter, apparently diverse galaxies or galaxy components have almost identical parameter correlations. This shows that they are related. A review of galaxy transformation processes suggests that S0 and spheroidal galaxies are star-formation-quenched, ``red and dead'' versions of spiral and Im galaxies. In particular, Sph galaxies are bulgeless S0s. This motivates a parallel sequence galaxy classification in which an S0a-S0b-S0c-Sph sequence of decreasing bulge-to-total ratios is juxtaposed to an Sa-Sb-Sc-Im sequence of star-forming galaxies. All parameter sequences show a complete continuity from giant galaxies to the tiniest dwarfs. Dwarfs are not a new or different class of galaxies. Rather, they are the extreme products of transformation processes that get more important as gravitational potential wells get more shallow. Smaller Sph and S+Im galaxies have lower stellar densities because they retain fewer baryons. Comparison of the baryonic parameter correlations with those for dark matter halos allows us to estimate baryon loss as a function of galaxy mass. Extreme dwarfs are almost completely dominated by dark matter.},

Discussion begins with first principles, physically motivating and deriving all results rather than merely presenting finished formulae. However, a reasonably good physics background (introductory quantum mechanics, intermediate electromagnetic theory, special relativity, and some statistical mechanics) is required. Much of this prerequisite material is provided by brief reviews, making the book a self-contained reference for workers in the field as well as the ideal text for senior or first-year graduate students of astronomy, astrophysics, and related physics courses. Radiative Processes in Astrophysics also contains about 75 problems, with solutions, illustrating applications of the material and methods for calculating results. This important and integral section emphasizes physical intuition by presenting important results that are used throughout the main text; it is here that most of the practical astrophysical applications become apparent.},

Observational results on all phases of the interstellar medium are summarized, various local phenomena occurring in the gas and in dust grains are discussed, and elastic collisions are studied in detail. Those interactions of the gas with radiation that can be understood without any detailed analysis of excitation conditions are examined and then treated on the basis of the steady-state equation, which is also used to analyze ionization, dissociation, and gas heating. The optical properties of grains and corresponding results for grain radii, composition, and mean density are presented; results of optical polarization studies and an alignment analysis are also reported. The theory of such grain properties as electric charge, temperature, radiative acceleration, and likely evolution is considered. The overall equilibrium and dynamics of the interstellar gas are investigated, including explosions of H II regions and supernova shells as well as processes of star formation.},

  abstract  = {This authoritative volume presents a thoroughly modern understanding of planetary nebulae, integrating new developments in stellar physics with the dynamics of nebular evolution. It covers all the stages in the evolution of planetary nebulae, carefully synthesizes observations from across the spectrum and clearly explains all the key physical processes at work. Particular emphasis is placed on recent observations from space, using the Hubble Space Telescope, the Infrared Space Observatory and the ROSAT satellite. Coverage also describes exciting possibilities such as the use of planetary nebulae in determining the cosmic distance scale, the distribution of dark matter and the chemical evolution of galaxies. This book provides graduate students with an accessible introduction to planetary nebulae, and researchers with an authoritative reference. It can also be used as an advanced textbook on the physics of the interstellar medium.},

With characteristic clarity of expression, Sidney van den Bergh provides a complete overview of all that is known about the galaxies of the Local Group and their evolution.  He also places this knowledge in the wider context of continuing studies of galaxy formation and evolution, the cosmic distance scale, and the conditions in the early Universe.  This volume thoroughly details our current understanding of each of the thirty-five members of the Local Group, as well as those galaxies previously regarded as possible members. The book goes on to examine the mass, stability and evolution of the Local Group as a whole and includes many important, previously unpublished results and conclusions.},

The searches have already unveiled $\{$approximately$\}$ 100 events, at least two of them caused by binaries, and have already proven to be useful for studies of the Galactic structure. The events detected so far are probably attributable to the effects of ordinary stars, and possibly to substellar brown dwarfs; however, a firm conclusion cannot be reached yet because the analysis published to date is based on a total of only 16 events. The current searches, soon to be upgraded, will probably allow determination of the mass function of stars and brown dwarfs in the next few years; these efforts will also provide good statistical information about binary systems, in particular their mass ratios. They may also reveal the nature of dark matter and allow us to detect planets and planetary mass objects.},

  abstract = {Dynamical searches reveal central dark objects with masses $\sim 10^6$to $10^{9.5}$ $\backslash$msun in the Galaxy, $\backslash$m31, $\backslash$mm32, M87, NGC 3115, NGC 3377, NGC 4258, and NGC 4594. Indirect arguments suggest but do not prove that these are supermassive black holes (BHs) like those postulated as quasar engines. This paper reviews dynamical search techniques, the robustness of the evidence, and BH demographics. Stellar-dynamical evidence is generally more robust than gas-dynamical evidence (gas velocities can be nongravitational), but gas measurements reach closer to the Schwarzschild radius, and in NGC 4258 they show a Keplerian rotation curve. A statistical survey finds BHs in $\sim 20\\%$ of nearby E--Sbc galaxies, consistent with predictions based on quasar energetics. BH masses are proportional to the mass of the bulge component. Most candidates are inactive; in some cases, the abundance of fuel is not easily reconciled with BH starvation. Flashes caused by the accretion of individual stars may provide a test of the BH picture.},

  abstract      = {Stellar clusters are born embedded within giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and during their formation and early evolution are often only visible at infrared wavelengths, being heavily obscured by dust. Over the past 15 years advances in infrared detection capabilities have enabled the first systematic studies of embedded clusters in galactic molecular clouds. In this article we review the current state of empirical knowledge concerning these extremely young protocluster systems. From a survey of the literature we compile the first extensive catalog of galactic embedded clusters. We use the catalog to construct the mass function and estimate the birthrate for embedded clusters within 2 kpc of the sun. We find that the embedded cluster birthrate exceeds that of visible open clusters by an order of magnitude or more indicating a high infant mortality rate for protocluster systems. Less than 4-7\% of embedded clusters survive emergence from molecular clouds to become bound clusters of Pleiades age. The vast majority (90\%) of stars that form in embedded clusters form in rich clusters of 100 or more members with masses in excess of 50 M$_{⊙}$. Moreover, observations of nearby cloud complexes indicate that embedded clusters account for a significant (70-90\%) fraction of all stars formed in GMCs. We review the role of embedded clusters in investigating the nature of the initial mass function (IMF) that, in one nearby example, has been measured over the entire range of stellar and substellar mass, from OB stars to substellar objects near the deuterium burning limit. We also review the role embedded clusters play in the investigation of circumstellar disk evolution and the important constraints they provide for understanding the origin of planetary systems. Finally, we discuss current ideas concerning the origin and dynamical evolution of embedded clusters and the implications for the formation of bound open clusters.},
