  abstract = {We present an overview of a new integral field spectroscopic survey called MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory), one of three core programs in the fourth-generation Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) that began on 2014 July 1. MaNGA will investigate the internal kinematic structure and composition of gas and stars in an unprecedented sample of 10,000 nearby galaxies. We summarize essential characteristics of the instrument and survey design in the context of MaNGA's key science goals and present prototype observations to demonstrate MaNGA's scientific potential. MaNGA employs dithered observations with 17 fiber-bundle integral field units that vary in diameter from 12'' (19 fibers) to 32'' (127 fibers). Two dual-channel spectrographs provide simultaneous wavelength coverage over 3600-10300 Å at R ~ 2000. With a typical integration time of 3 hr, MaNGA reaches a target r -band signal-to-noise ratio of 4-8 (Å –1 per 2'' fiber) at 23 AB mag arcsec –2 , which is typical for the outskirts of MaNGA galaxies. Targets are selected with M * ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 10 9 M ☉ using SDSS-I redshifts and i -band luminosity to achieve uniform radial coverage in terms of the effective radius, an approximately flat distribution in stellar mass, and a sample spanning a wide range of environments. Analysis of our prototype observations demonstrates MaNGA's ability to probe gas ionization, shed light on recent star formation and quenching, enable dynamical modeling, decompose constituent components, and map the composition of stellar populations. MaNGA's spatially resolved spectra will enable an unprecedented study of the astrophysics of nearby galaxies in the coming 6 yr.},

  abstract = {In a six-year program started in 2014 July, the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) will conduct novel cosmological observations using the BOSS spectrograph at Apache Point Observatory. These observations will be conducted simultaneously with the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS) designed for variability studies and the Spectroscopic Identification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS) program designed for studies of X-ray sources. In particular, eBOSS will measure with percent-level precision the distance-redshift relation with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of matter. eBOSS will use four different tracers of the underlying matter density field to vastly expand the volume covered by BOSS and map the large-scale-structures over the relatively unconstrained redshift range0.6 < z < 2.2. Using more than 250,000 new, spectroscopically confirmed luminous red galaxies at a median redshift z = 0.72, we project that eBOSS will yield measurements of the angular diameter distance d A ( z ) to an accuracy of 1.2% and measurements of H ( z ) to 2.1% when combined with the z > 0.6 sample of BOSS galaxies. With ∼195,000 new emission line galaxy redshifts, we expect BAO measurements of d A ( z ) to an accuracy of 3.1% and H ( z ) to 4.7% at an effective redshift of z = 0.87. A sample of more than 500,000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars will provide the first BAO distance measurements over the redshift range0.9 < z < 2.2, with expected precision of 2.8% and 4.2% on d A ( z ) and H ( z ), respectively. Finally, with 60,000 new quasars and re-observation of 60,000 BOSS quasars, we will obtain new Ly α forest measurements at redshifts z > 2.1; these new data will enhance the precision of d A ( z ) and H ( z ) at z > 2.1 by a factor of 1.44 relative to BOSS. Furthermore, eBOSS will provide improved tests of General Relativity on cosmological scales through redshift-space distortion measurements, improved tests for non-Gaussianity in the primordial density field, and new constraints on the summed mass of all neutrino species. Here, we provide an overview of the cosmological goals, spectroscopic target sample, demonstration of spectral quality from early data, and projected cosmological constraints from eBOSS.},

  abstract    = {The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) is designed to measure the scale of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of matter over a larger volume than the combined efforts of all previous spectroscopic surveys of large scale structure. BOSS uses 1.5 million luminous galaxies as faint as i=19.9 over 10,000 square degrees to measure BAO to redshifts z<0.7. Observations of neutral hydrogen in the Lyman alpha forest in more than 150,000 quasar spectra (g<22) will constrain BAO over the redshift range 2.15<z<3.5. Early results from BOSS include the first detection of the large-scale three-dimensional clustering of the Lyman alpha forest and a strong detection from the Data Release 9 data set of the BAO in the clustering of massive galaxies at an effective redshift z = 0.57. We project that BOSS will yield measurements of the angular diameter distance D_A to an accuracy of 1.0% at redshifts z=0.3 and z=0.57 and measurements of H(z) to 1.8% and 1.7% at the same redshifts. Forecasts for Lyman alpha forest constraints predict a measurement of an overall dilation factor that scales the highly degenerate D_A(z) and H^{-1}(z) parameters to an accuracy of 1.9% at z~2.5 when the survey is complete. Here, we provide an overview of the selection of spectroscopic targets, planning of observations, and analysis of data and data quality of BOSS.},

Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected, each with extensive ancillary data.

The survey covers approximately 800 arcmin 2 and is divided into two parts. The CANDELS/Deep survey (5σ point-source limit H = 27.7 mag) covers ~125 arcmin 2 within Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS)-N and GOODS-S. The CANDELS/Wide survey includes GOODS and three additional fields (Extended Groth Strip, COSMOS, and Ultra-deep Survey) and covers the full area to a 5σ point-source limit of H ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 27.0 mag. Together with the Hubble Ultra Deep Fields, the strategy creates a three-tiered "wedding-cake" approach that has proven efficient for extragalactic surveys. Data from the survey are nonproprietary and are useful for a wide variety of science investigations. In this paper, we describe the basic motivations for the survey, the CANDELS team science goals and the resulting observational requirements, the field selection and geometry, and the observing design.

We summarize the observational aspects of the survey as motivated by the scientific goals and present a detailed description of the data reduction procedures and products from the survey. Our data reduction methods utilize the most up-to-date calibration files and image combination procedures. We have paid special attention to correcting a range of instrumental effects, including charge transfer efficiency degradation for ACS, removal of electronic bias-striping present in ACS data after Servicing Mission 4, and persistence effects and other artifacts in WFC3/IR. For each field, we release mosaics for individual epochs and eventual mosaics containing data from all epochs combined, to facilitate photometric variability studies and the deepest possible photometry.

LRG targets are required to meet a set of color selection criteria and have z-band and i-band MODEL magnitudes z < 19.95 and 19.9 < i < 21.8, respectively. Our algorithm selects roughly 50 LRG targets per square degree, the great majority of which lie in the redshift range 0.6 < z < 1.0 (median redshift 0.71). We demonstrate that our methods are highly effective at eliminating stellar contamination and lower-redshift galaxies. We perform a number of tests using spectroscopic data from SDSS-III/BOSS to determine the redshift reliability of our target selection and its ability to meet the science requirements of eBOSS. The SDSS spectra are of high enough signal-to-noise ratio that at least 89% of the target sample yields secure redshift measurements. We also present tests of the uniformity and homogeneity of the sample, demonstrating that it should be clean enough for studies of the large-scale structure of the universe at higher redshifts than SDSS-III/BOSS LRGs reached.},

  title       = {SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Data Release 12: galaxy target selection and large scale structure catalogues},
  abstract    = {The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) III project, has provided the largest survey of galaxy redshifts available to date, in terms of both the number of galaxy redshifts measured by a single survey, and the effective cosmological volume covered. Key to analysing the clustering of these data to provide cosmological measurements is understanding the detailed properties of this sample. Potential issues include variations in the target catalogue caused by changes either in the targeting algorithm or properties of the data used, the pattern of spectroscopic observations, the spatial distribution of targets for which redshifts were not obtained, and variations in the target sky density due to observational systematics. We document here the target selection algorithms used to create the galaxy samples that comprise BOSS. We also present the algorithms used to create large scale structure catalogues for the final Data Release (DR12) samples and the associated random catalogues that quantify the survey mask. The algorithms are an evolution of those used by the BOSS team to construct catalogues from earlier data, and have been designed to accurately quantify the galaxy sample. The code used, designated MKSAMPLE, is released with this paper.},

  title       = {The extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS): testing a new approach to measure the evolution of the structure growth},
  abstract    = {The extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) is one of the first of a new generation of galaxy redshift surveys that will cover a large range in redshift with sufficient resolution to measure the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) signal. For surveys covering a large redshift range we can no longer ignore cosmological evolution, meaning that either the redshift shells analysed have to be significantly narrower than the survey, or we have to allow for the averaging over evolving quantities. Both of these have the potential to remove signal: analysing small volumes increases the size of the Fourier window function, reducing the large-scale information, while averaging over evolving quantities can, if not performed carefully, remove differential information. It will be important to measure cosmological evolution from these surveys to explore and discriminate between models. We apply a method to optimally extract this differential information to mock catalogues designed to mimic the eBOSS quasar sample. By applying a set of weights to extract redshift space distortion measurements as a function of redshift, we demonstrate an analysis that does not invoke the problems discussed above. We show that our estimator gives unbiased constraints.},

  abstract    = {We present Hubble multi-wavelength photometric catalogs, including (up to) 17 filters with the Advanced Camera for Surveys and Wide Field Camera 3 from the ultra-violet to near-infrared for the Hubble Frontier Fields and associated parallels. We have constructed homogeneous photometric catalogs for all six clusters and their parallels. To further expand these data catalogs, we have added ultra-deep $K_{S}$-band imaging at 2.2~\micron\ from the Very Large Telescope HAWK-I and Keck-I MOSFIRE instruments. We also add post-cryogenic \spitzer\ imaging at 3.6~\micron\ and 4.5~\micron\ with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC), as well as archival IRAC 5.8~\micron\ and 8.0~\micron\ imaging when available. We introduce the public release of the multi-wavelength (0.2--8~\micron) photometric catalogs, and we describe the unique steps applied for the construction of these catalogs. Particular emphasis is given to the source detection band, the contamination of light from the bright cluster galaxies and intra-cluster light. In addition to the photometric catalogs, we provide catalogs of photometric redshifts and stellar population properties. Furthermore, this includes all the images used in the construction of the catalogs, including the combined models of bright cluster galaxies and intra-cluster light, the residual images, segmentation maps and more. These catalogs are a robust data set of the Hubble Frontier Fields and will be an important aide in designing future surveys, as well as planning follow-up programs with current and future observatories to answer key questions remaining about first light, reionization, the assembly of galaxies and many more topics, most notably, by identifying high-redshift sources to target.},

  abstract      = {We present quantified visual morphologies of approximately 48 000 galaxies observed in three Hubble Space Telescope legacy fields by the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) and classified by participants in the Galaxy Zoo project. 90 per cent of galaxies have z {\le} 3 and are observed in rest-frame optical wavelengths by CANDELS. Each galaxy received an average of 40 independent classifications, which we combine into detailed morphological information on galaxy features such as clumpiness, bar instabilities, spiral structure, and merger and tidal signatures. We apply a consensus-based classifier weighting method that preserves classifier independence while effectively down-weighting significantly outlying classifications. After analysing the effect of varying image depth on reported classifications, we also provide depth-corrected classifications which both preserve the information in the deepest observations and also enable the use of classifications at comparable depths across the full survey. Comparing the Galaxy Zoo classifications to previous classifications of the same galaxies shows very good agreement; for some applications, the high number of independent classifications provided by Galaxy Zoo provides an advantage in selecting galaxies with a particular morphological profile, while in others the combination of Galaxy Zoo with other classifications is a more promising approach than using any one method alone. We combine the Galaxy Zoo classifications of `smooth' galaxies with parametric morphologies to select a sample of featureless discs at 1 {\le} z {\le} 3, which may represent a dynamically warmer progenitor population to the settled disc galaxies seen at later epochs.},

All these fields have a wealth of publicly available imaging data sets in addition to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data, which makes it possible to construct the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of objects over a wide wavelength range. In this paper we describe a photometric analysis of the CANDELS and 3D-HST HST imaging and the ancillary imaging data at wavelengths 0.3-8 μm. Objects were selected in the WFC3 near-IR bands, and their SEDs were determined by carefully taking the effects of the point-spread function in each observation into account. A total of 147 distinct imaging data sets were used in the analysis. The photometry is made available in the form of six catalogs: one for each field, as well as a master catalog containing all objects in the entire survey. We also provide derived data products: photometric redshifts, determined with the EAZY code, and stellar population parameters determined with the FAST code. We make all the imaging data that were used in the analysis available, including our reductions of the WFC3 imaging in all five fields. 3D-HST is a spectroscopic survey with the WFC3 and ACS grisms, and the photometric catalogs presented here constitute a necessary first step in the analysis of these grism data. All the data presented in this paper are available through the 3D-HST Web site (http://3dhst.research.yale.edu).},

  abstract    = {The fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) has been in operation since July 2014. This paper describes the second data release from this phase, and the fourteenth from SDSS overall (making this, Data Release Fourteen or DR14). This release makes public data taken by SDSS-IV in its first two years of operation (July 2014-2016). Like all previous SDSS releases, DR14 is cumulative, including the most recent reductions and calibrations of all data taken by SDSS since the first phase began operations in 2000. New in DR14 is the first public release of data from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS); the first data from the second phase of the Apache Point Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-2), including stellar parameter estimates from an innovative data driven machine learning algorithm known as "The Cannon"; and almost twice as many data cubes from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey as were in the previous release (N = 2812 in total). This paper describes the location and format of the publicly available data from SDSS-IV surveys. We provide references to the important technical papers describing how these data have been taken (both targeting and observation details) and processed for scientific use. The SDSS website (www.sdss.org) has been updated for this release, and provides links to data downloads, as well as tutorials and examples of data use. SDSS-IV is planning to continue to collect astronomical data until 2020, and will be followed by SDSS-V.},

  title       = {The Eleventh and Twelfth Data Releases of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: Final Data from SDSS-III},
  abstract    = {The third generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III) took data from 2008 to 2014 using the original SDSS wide-field imager, the original and an upgraded multi-object fiber-fed optical spectrograph, a new near-infrared high-resolution spectrograph, and a novel optical interferometer. All the data from SDSS-III are now made public. In particular, this paper describes Data Release 11 (DR11) including all data acquired through 2013 July, and Data Release 12 (DR12) adding data acquired through 2014 July (including all data included in previous data releases), marking the end of SDSS-III observing. Relative to our previous public release (DR10), DR12 adds one million new spectra of galaxies and quasars from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) over an additional 3000 sq. deg of sky, more than triples the number of H-band spectra of stars as part of the Apache Point Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), and includes repeated accurate radial velocity measurements of 5500 stars from the Multi-Object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanet Large-area Survey (MARVELS). The APOGEE outputs now include measured abundances of 15 different elements for each star. In total, SDSS-III added 2350 sq. deg of ugriz imaging; 155,520 spectra of 138,099 stars as part of the Sloan Exploration of Galactic Understanding and Evolution 2 (SEGUE-2) survey; 2,497,484 BOSS spectra of 1,372,737 galaxies, 294,512 quasars, and 247,216 stars over 9376 sq. deg; 618,080 APOGEE spectra of 156,593 stars; and 197,040 MARVELS spectra of 5,513 stars. Since its first light in 1998, SDSS has imaged over 1/3 of the Celestial sphere in five bands and obtained over five million astronomical spectra.},

  abstract = {In the course of its commissioning observations, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has produced one of the largest redshift samples of galaxies selected from CCD images. Using 11,275 galaxies complete to r * = 17.6 over 140 deg 2 , we compute the luminosity function of galaxies in the r * band over a range -23 < M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/121/5/2358/img1.gif] < -16 (for h = 1). The result is well-described by a Schechter function with parameters ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/phi.gif] {phi} * = (1.46 ± 0.12) × 10 -2 h 3 Mpc -3 , M * = -20.83 ± 0.03, and α = -1.20 ± 0.03. The implied luminosity density in r * is j ≈ (2.6 ± 0.3) × 10 8 h L ⊙ Mpc -3 . We find that the surface brightness selection threshold has a negligible impact for M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/121/5/2358/img1.gif] < -18. Using subsets of the data, we measure the luminosity function in the u *, g *, i *, and z * bands as well; the slope at low luminosities ranges from α = -1.35 to α = -1.2. We measure the bivariate distribution of r * luminosity with half-light surface brightness, intrinsic g *- r * color, and morphology. In agreement with previous studies, we find that high surface brightness, red, highly concentrated galaxies are on average more luminous than low surface brightness, blue, less concentrated galaxies. An important feature of the SDSS luminosity function is the use of Petrosian magnitudes, which measure a constant fraction of a galaxy's total light regardless of the amplitude of its surface brightness profile. If we synthesize results for R GKC band or b j band using these Petrosian magnitudes, we obtain luminosity densities 2 times that found by the Las Campanas Redshift Survey in R GKC and 1.4 times that found by the Two Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey in b j . However, we are able to reproduce the luminosity functions obtained by these surveys if we also mimic their isophotal limits for defining galaxy magnitudes, which are shallower and more redshift dependent than the Petrosian magnitudes used by the SDSS.},

The catalog is based on source detection in the WFC3 F160W band. The F160W mosaic includes the data from CANDELS deep and wide observations as well as previous ERS and HUDF09 programs. The mosaic reaches a 5σ limiting depth (within an aperture of radius 0.''17) of 27.4, 28.2, and 29.7 AB for CANDELS wide, deep, and HUDF regions, respectively. The catalog contains 34,930 sources with the representative 50% completeness reaching 25.9, 26.6, and 28.1 AB in the F160W band for the three regions. In addition to WFC3 bands, the catalog also includes data from UV ( U band from both CTIO/MOSAIC and VLT/VIMOS), optical ( HST /ACS F435W, F606W, F775W, F814W, and F850LP), and infrared ( HST /WFC3 F098M, VLT/ISAAC Ks , VLT/HAWK-I Ks , and Spitzer /IRAC 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0 μm) observations. The catalog is validated via stellar colors, comparison with other published catalogs, zero-point offsets determined from the best-fit templates of the spectral energy distribution of spectroscopically observed objects, and the accuracy of photometric redshifts. The catalog is able to detect unreddened star-forming (passive) galaxies with stellar mass of 10 10 M ☉ at a 50% completeness level to z ~ 3.4 (2.8), 4.6 (3.2), and 7.0 (4.2) in the three regions. As an example of application, the catalog is used to select both star-forming and passive galaxies at z ~ 2-4 via the Balmer break. It is also used to study the color-magnitude diagram of galaxies at 0 < z < 4.},

Separating early- and late-type galaxies on the basis of star-formation activity, we confirm that early-type galaxies are on average smaller than late-type galaxies at all redshifts, and we find a significantly different rate of average size evolution at fixed galaxy mass, with fast evolution for the early-type population, R eff ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} (1 + z ) –1.48 , and moderate evolution for the late-type population, R eff ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} (1 + z ) –0.75 . The large sample size and dynamic range in both galaxy mass and redshift, in combination with the high fidelity of our measurements due to the extensive use of spectroscopic data, not only fortify previous results but also enable us to probe beyond simple average galaxy size measurements.

For late-type galaxies, the logarithmic size distribution is not symmetric but is skewed toward small sizes: at all redshifts and masses, a tail of small late-type galaxies exists that overlaps in size with the early-type galaxy population. The number density of massive (~10 11 M ☉ ), compact ( R eff < 2 kpc) early-type galaxies increases from z = 3 to z = 1.5-2 and then strongly decreases at later cosmic times.},

The parameters of the best-fitting Sérsic models (total magnitude, half-light radius, Sérsic index, axis ratio, and position angle) are made public, along with newly constructed point-spread functions for each field and filter. Random uncertainties in the measured parameters are estimated for each individual object based on a comparison between multiple, independent measurements of the same set of objects. To quantify systematic uncertainties, we create a mosaic with simulated galaxy images with a realistic distribution of input parameters and then process and analyze the mosaic in an identical manner as the real data. We find that accurate and precise measurements—to 10% or better—of all structural parameters can typically be obtained for galaxies with H F160W < 23, with comparable fidelity for basic size and shape measurements for galaxies to H F160W ~ 24.5.},

  abstract = {We present a spectroscopic study of 51 compact field galaxies with redshifts z < 1.4 and apparent magnitudes I 814 < 23.74 in the flanking fields of the Hubble Deep Field. These galaxies are compact in the sense that they have small apparent half-light radii ( r 1/2 ≤ 0 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/farcs.gif] {farcs} 5) and high surface brightnesses (μ I 814 ≤ 22.2 mag arcsec -2 ). The spectra, taken at the Keck telescope, show emission lines in 88% of our sample, and only absorption lines in the remaining 12%. Emission-line profiles are roughly Gaussian with velocity widths that range from the measurement limit of σ ~ 35 km s -1 to 150 km s -1 . Rest frame [O II ] λ3727 equivalent widths range from 5 to 94 Å, yielding star formation rates (SFRs) of ~0.1 to 14 M ☉ yr -1 . The analysis of various line diagnostic diagrams reveals that ~60% of compact emission-line galaxies have velocity widths, excitations, Hβ luminosities, SFRs, and mass-to-light ratios characteristic of young star-forming H II galaxies. The remaining 40% form a more heterogeneous class of evolved starbursts, similar to local starburst disk galaxies. We find that, although the compact galaxies at z > 0.7 have similar SFRs per unit mass to those at z < 0.7, they are on average ~10 times more massive . Our sample implies a lower limit for the global comoving SFR density of ~0.004 M ☉ yr -1 Mpc -3 at z = 0.55, and ~0.008 M ☉ yr -1 Mpc -3 at z = 0.85 (assuming Salpeter IMF, H 0 = 50 km s -1 Mpc -1 , and q 0 = 0.5). These values, when compared to estimates for a sample of local compact galaxies selected in a similar fashion, support a history of the universe in which the SFR density declines by a factor ~10 from z = 1 to today. From the comparison with the SFR densities derived for magnitude-limited samples of field galaxies, we conclude that compact emission-line galaxies, though only ~20% of the general field population, may contribute as much as ~45% to the global SFR of the universe at 0.4 < z < 1.},

  abstract = {We set out to test the claim that the recently identified population of compact, massive, and quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2.3 must undergo significant size evolution to match the properties of galaxies found in the local universe. Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; Data Release 7), we have conducted a search for local red sequence galaxies with sizes and masses comparable to those found at z ~ 2.3. The SDSS spectroscopic target selection algorithm excludes high surface brightness objects; we show that this makes incompleteness a concern for such massive, compact galaxies, particularly for low redshifts ( z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 0.05). We have identified63 M * >10 10.7 M ☉ ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 5 × 10 10 M ☉ ) red sequence galaxies at 0.066 < z spec < 0.12 which are smaller than the median size-mass relation by a factor of 2 or more. Consistent with expectations from the virial theorem, the median offset from the mass-velocity dispersion relation for these galaxies is 0.12 dex. We do not, however, find any galaxies with sizes and masses comparable to those observed at z ~ 2.3, implying a decrease in the comoving number density of these galaxies, at fixed size and mass, by a factor of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 5000. This result cannot be explained by incompleteness: in the 0.066 < z < 0.12 interval, we estimate that the SDSS spectroscopic sample should typically be ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 75% complete for galaxies with the sizes and masses seen at high redshift, although for the very smallest galaxies it may be as low as ~20%. In order to confirm that the absence of such compact massive galaxies in SDSS is not produced by spectroscopic selection effects, we have also looked for such galaxies in the basic SDSS photometric catalog, using photometric redshifts. While we do find signs of a slight bias against massive, compact galaxies, this analysis suggests that the SDSS spectroscopic sample is missing at most a few objects in the regime we consider. Accepting the high-redshift results, it is clear that massive galaxies must undergo significant structural evolution over z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 2 in order to match the population seen in the local universe. Our results suggest that a highly stochastic mechanism (e.g., major mergers) cannot be the primary driver of this strong size evolution.},

The majority of the observed galaxies are emission-line systems, while a significant fraction (23%-34%) appear to be normal ellipticals or otherwise early-type systems. One object is an active galactic nucleus, and two are at high redshift ( z > 2). The Keck redshift and photometric data are combined with Hubble Space Telescope images to derive luminosities and physical sizes. We also use emission-line widths, where available, to estimate masses. About two-thirds of the emission-line galaxies, or roughly one-half the sample, are small, low-mass, relatively luminous systems with properties resembling those of local H II galaxies. We compare the properties and numbers of these galaxies to the "bursting dwarf" model of Babul & Ferguson. Our sample includes many galaxies similar to the model galaxies in the redshift range 0.4 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} 0.7, but the majority of our compact galaxies are more luminous (by up to an order of magnitude) than those of the model. The number of galaxies fitting the model parameters are lower by a factor of 2-3 than predicted. An examination of samples used in analyses of disk surface brightness at redshifts z > 0.5 shows that compact galaxies are likely to contribute to the strong disk luminosity evolution found in some studies. Estimates of comoving volume densities indicate that the population of apparent H II galaxies evolves rapidly from redshifts of z ~ 1 to the present. It appears that not all of these galaxies can be progenitors of present-day spheroidal galaxies, although the numbers of them with sizes and masses comparable to spheroidals is not dissimilar to estimates of the local field spheroidal density. We also present 51 additional redshifts, acquired for other projects during the same observing period, for a total of 105 objects with identified redshifts z < 2 in the Hubble Deep Field and its flanking fields.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift are much more compact than present-day galaxies of the same mass. Here we compare the radial stellar density profiles and the number density of a sample of massive galaxies at z ~ 2.3 to nearby massive elliptical galaxies. We confirm that the average stellar densities of the z ~ 2.3 galaxies within the effective radius, ρ(< r e ), are two orders of magnitude higher than those of local elliptical galaxies of the same stellar mass. However, we also find that the densities measured within a constant physical radius of 1 kpc, ρ(<1 kpc), are higher by a factor of 2-3 only. This suggests that inside-out growth scenarios are plausible, in which the compact high-redshift galaxies make up the centers of normal nearby ellipticals. The compact galaxies are common at high redshift, which enables us to further constrain their evolution by requiring that the number density of their descendants does not exceed constraints imposed by the z = 0 galaxy mass function. We infer that size growth must be efficient, with ( r 1+2 / r 1 ) ~ ( M 1+2 / M 1 ) 2 . A simple model where compact galaxies with masses ~10 11 M ☉ primarily grow through minor mergers produces descendants with the approximate sizes, stellar densities, and number density of elliptical galaxies with masses 2-3 × 10 11 M ☉ in the local universe. We note that this model also predicts evolution in the M BH – σ relation, such that the progenitors of elliptical galaxies have lower black hole masses at fixed velocity dispersion. The main observational uncertainty is the conversion from light to mass; measurements of kinematics are needed to calibrate the masses and stellar densities of the high-redshift galaxies.},

  abstract = {Recent observations show evidence that high-z (z {\tilde} 2-3) early-type galaxies (ETGs) are more compact than those with comparable mass at z {\tilde} 0. Such size evolution is most likely explained by the `dry merger sceanario'. However, previous studies based on this scenario cannot consistently explain the properties of both high-z compact massive ETGs and local ETGs. We investigate the effect of multiple sequential dry minor mergers on the size evolution of compact massive ETGs. From an analysis of the Millennium Simulation Data Base, we show that such minor (stellar mass ratio M$_{2}$/M$_{1}$ $\lt$ 1/4) mergers are extremely common during hierarchical structure formation. We perform N-body simulations of sequential minor mergers with parabolic and head-on orbits, including a dark matter component and a stellar component. Typical mass ratios of these minor mergers are 1/20 $\lt$ M$_{2}$/M$_{1}$ {\le}q 1/10. We show that sequential minor mergers of compact satellite galaxies are the most efficient at promoting size growth and decreasing the velocity dispersion of compact massive ETGs in our simulations. The change of stellar size and density of the merger remnants is consistent with recent observations. Furthermore, we construct the merger histories of candidates for high-z compact massive ETGs using the Millennium Simulation Data Base and estimate the size growth of the galaxies through the dry minor merger scenario. We can reproduce the mean size growth factor between z = 2 and z = 0, assuming the most efficient size growth obtained during sequential minor mergers in our simulations. However, we note that our numerical result is only valid for merger histories with typical mass ratios between 1/20 and 1/10 with parabolic and head-on orbits and that our most efficient size-growth efficiency is likely an upper limit.},

We use very deep near-infrared images of the Hubble Deep Field-South and the MS 1054-03 field in the J s , H , and K s bands from FIRES to retrieve the sizes in the optical rest frame for galaxies with z > 1. We combine our results with those from GEMS at 0.2 < z < 1 and SDSS at z ~ 0.1 to achieve a comprehensive picture of the optical rest-frame size evolution from z = 0 to 3. Galaxies are differentiated according to their light concentration using the Sérsic index n . For less concentrated objects, the galaxies at a given luminosity were typically ~3 ± 0.5 (±2 σ) times smaller at z ~ 2.5 than those we see today. The stellar mass-size relation has evolved less: the mean size at a given stellar mass was ~2 ± 0.5 times smaller at z ~ 2.5, evolving proportionally to (1 + z ) -0.40±0.06 . Simple scaling relations between dark matter halos and baryons in a hierarchical cosmogony predict a stronger (although consistent within the error bars) than observed evolution of the stellar mass-size relation. The observed luminosity-size evolution out to z ~ 2.5 matches well recent infall model predictions for Milky Way-type objects. For low- n galaxies, the evolution of the stellar mass-size relation would follow naturally if the individual galaxies grow inside out. For highly concentrated objects, the situation is as follows: at a given luminosity, these galaxies were ~2.7 ± 1.1 times smaller at z ~ 2.5 (or, put differently, were typically ~2.2 ± 0.7 mag brighter at a given size than they are today), and at a given stellar mass the size has evolved proportionally to (1 + z ) -0.45±0.10 .},

  abstract = {We present an analysis of galaxies in the CDF-South. We find a tight relation to z = 3 between color and size at a given mass, with red galaxies being small, and blue galaxies being large. We show that the relation is driven by stellar surface density or inferred velocity dispersion: galaxies with high surface density are red and have low specific star formation rates, and galaxies with low surface density are blue and have high specific star formation rates. Surface density and inferred velocity dispersion are better correlated with specific star formation rate and color than stellar mass. Hence stellar mass by itself is not a good predictor of the star formation history of galaxies. In general, galaxies at a given surface density have higher specific star formation rates at higher redshift. Specifically, galaxies with a surface density of (1–3) × 10 9 M ☉ kpc −2 are "red and dead" at low redshift, approximately 50% are forming stars at z = 1, and almost all are forming stars by z = 2. This provides direct additional evidence for the late evolution of galaxies onto the red sequence. The sizes of galaxies at a given mass evolve like 1/(1 + z ) 0.59 ± 0.10 . Hence galaxies undergo significant upsizing in their history. The size evolution is fastest for the highest mass galaxies and quiescent galaxies. The persistence of the structural relations from z = 0 to z = 2.5, and the upsizing of galaxies imply that a relation analogous to the Hubble sequence exists out to z = 2.5, and possibly beyond. The star-forming galaxies at z ≥ 1.5 are quite different from star-forming galaxies at z = 0, as they have likely very high gas fractions, and star formation timescales comparable to the orbital time.},

Their integrated spectral energy distributions and velocity dispersions are in good agreement with the observations, and their position in the ( v maj /σ, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/epsi.gif] {epsilon} ) diagram traces the upper envelope of the distribution of lower redshift early-type galaxies. The simulated merger remnants show time- and sightline-dependent M / L ratio gradients that result from a superposition of radially dependent stellar age, stellar metallicity, and extinction. The median ratio of the effective radius in rest-frame V -band light to that in mass surface density is ~2 during the quiescent remnant phase. This is typically expressed by a negative color gradient (i.e., red core), which we expect to correlate with the integrated color of the system. Finally, the simulations differ from the observations in their surface brightness profile shape. The simulated remnants are typically best fit by high ( n ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/Gt.gif] {Gt} 4) Sérsic indices, whereas observed quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2 tend to be less cuspy ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lang.gif] {lang} n ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rang.gif] {rang} ~ 2.3).

Here we analyze samples of nearby and distant ( z ~ 1) galaxies with dynamically measured masses in order to confirm the previous, model-dependent results and constrain the uncertainties that may play a role. Velocity dispersion (σ) measurements are taken from the literature for 50 morphologically selected 0.8 < z < 1.2 field and cluster early-type galaxies with typical masses M dyn = 2 × 10 11 M ☉ . Sizes ( R eff ) are determined with Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging. We compare the distant sample with a large sample of nearby ( 0.04 < z < 0.08) early-type galaxies extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey for which we determine sizes, masses, and densities in a consistent manner, using simulations to quantify systematic differences between the size measurements of nearby and distant galaxies. We find a highly significant difference between the σ − R eff distributions of the nearby and distant samples, regardless of sample selection effects. The implied evolution in R eff at fixed mass between z = 1 and the present is a factor of 1.97 ± 0.15. This is in qualitative agreement with semianalytic models; however, the observed evolution is much faster than the predicted evolution. Our results reinforce and are quantitatively consistent with previous, photometric studies that found size evolution of up to a factor of 5 since z ~ 2. A combination of structural evolution of individual galaxies through the accretion of companions and the continuous formation of early-type galaxies through increasingly gas-poor mergers is one plausible explanation of the observations.},

In this letter, we determine the statistical equilibrium of systems with a distribution of masses, semi-major axes, and eccentricities. We average the interaction over the apsidal precession time and construct a Monte Carlo Markov Chain method to sample the microcanonical ensemble of the NSC. We examine the case of NSCs formed by episodes of star formation or globular cluster infall. We find that the massive stars and stellar mass black holes form a warped disk, while low mass stars resemble a spherical distribution with a possible net rotation. This explains the origin of the clockwise disk in the Galactic center and predicts a population of black holes (BHs) embedded within this structure. The rate of mergers among massive stars, tidal disruption events among BHs and massive stars, and BH-BH mergers are highly increased in such disks. The first two may explain the origin of the observed G1 and G2 clouds, the latter may be important for gravitational wave detections with LIGO and VIRGO. More generally, black holes are expected to settle in disks in all spherical dense stellar systems including globular clusters.},

The principal goal of stellar population synthesis (SPS) is to extract these variables from observed SEDs. In this review I provide an overview of the SPS technique and discuss what can be reliably measured from galaxy SEDs. Topics include stellar masses, star-formation rates and histories, metallicities and abundance patterns, dust properties, and the stellar initial mass function. },

This enabled the first compilation of the multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of a statistically reliable survey of SMGs. In this paper, we present a new calibration of the magphys SED modeling code that is optimized to fit these ultraviolet-to-radio SEDs of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn1.gif] {$z\gt 1$} star-forming galaxies using an energy balance technique to connect the emission from stellar populations, dust attenuation, and dust emission in a physically consistent way. We derive statistically and physically robust estimates of the photometric redshifts and physical parameters (such as stellar masses, dust attenuation, star formation rates (SFRs), and dust masses) for the ALESS SMGs. We find that the ALESS SMGs have median stellar mass ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn2.gif] {${M}_{*}=8.9\pm 0.1\times {10}^{10}\;{M}_{\odot }$} , median SFR ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn3.gif] {$=\;280\pm 70\;{M}_{\odot }\;{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$} , median overall V -band dust attenuation ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn4.gif] {${A}_{V}=1.9\pm 0.2$} mag, median dust mass ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn5.gif] {${M}_{\mathrm{dust}}=(5.6\pm 1.0)\times {10}^{8}\;{M}_{\odot }$} , and median average dust temperature ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn6.gif] {${T}_{\mathrm{dust}}\simeq 40$} K. We find that the average intrinsic SED of the ALESS SMGs resembles that of local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies in the infrared range, but the stellar emission of our average SMG is brighter and bluer, indicating lower dust attenuation, possibly because they are more extended. We explore how the average SEDs vary with different parameters (redshift, sub-millimeter flux, dust attenuation, and total infrared luminosity), and we provide a new set of SMG templates that can be used to interpret other SMG observations. To put the ALESS SMGs into context, we compare their stellar masses and SFRs with those of less actively star-forming galaxies at the same redshifts. We find that at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn7.gif] {$z\simeq 2$} , about half of the SMGs lie above the star-forming main sequence (with SFRs three times larger than normal galaxies of the same stellar mass), while half are consistent with being at the high-mass end of the main sequence. At higher redshifts ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn8.gif] {$z\simeq 3.5$} ), the SMGs tend to have higher SFRs and stellar masses, but the fraction of SMGs that lie significantly above the main sequence decreases to less than a third.},

  abstract = {We present far-infrared (FIR) photometry at 150 and 205 {$\mu$}m of eight low-redshift starburst galaxies obtained with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) ISOPHOT. Five of the eight galaxies are detected in both wave bands, and these data are used, in conjunction with IRAS archival photometry, to model the dust emission at {$\lambda$}$\gt$\~{}40 {$\mu$}m. The FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are best fitted by a combination of two modified Planck functions, with T\~{}40-55 K (warm dust) and T\~{}20-23 K (cool dust) and with a dust emissivity index {$\epsilon$}=2. The cool dust can be a major contributor to the FIR emission of starburst galaxies, representing up to 60\% of the total flux. This component is heated not only by the general interstellar radiation field, but also by the starburst itself. The cool dust mass is up to \~{}150 times larger than the warm dust mass, bringing the gas-to-dust ratios of the starbursts in our sample close to Milky Way values, once rescaled for the appropriate metallicity. The ratio between the total dust FIR emission in the range 1-1000 {$\mu$}m and the IRAS FIR emission in the range 40-120 {$\mu$}m is \~{}1.75, with small variations from galaxy to galaxy. This ratio is about 40\% larger than previously inferred from data at millimeter wavelengths. Although the galaxies in our sample are generally classified as ``UV bright,'' for four of them the UV energy emerging shortward of 0.2 {$\mu$}m is less than 15\% of the FIR energy. On average, about 30\% of the bolometric flux is coming out in the UV-to-near-IR wavelength range; the rest is emitted in the FIR. Energy balance calculations show that the FIR emission predicted by the dust reddening of the UV-to-near-IR stellar emission is within a factor of \~{}2 of the observed value in individual galaxies and within 20\% when averaged over a large sample. If our sample of local starbursts is representative of high-redshift (z$\gt$\~{}1), UV-bright, star-forming galaxies, these galaxies' FIR emission will be generally undetected in submillimeter surveys, unless (1) their bolometric luminosity is comparable to or larger than that of ultraluminous FIR galaxies and (2) their FIR SED contains a cool dust component.

  abstract = {We analyze the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) UV and the optical spectra of 39 starburst and blue compact galaxies in order to study the average properties of dust extinction in extended regions of galaxies. The optical spectra have been obtained using an aperture which matches that of IUE, so comparable regions within each galaxy are sampled. The data from the 39 galaxies are compared with five models for the geometrical distribution of dust, adopting as extinction laws both the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud laws. The commonly used uniform dust screen is included among the models. We find that none of the five models is in satisfactory agreement with the data. In order to understand the discrepancy between the data and the models, we have derived an extinction law directly from the data in the UV and optical wavelength range. The resulting curve is characterized by an overall slope which is more gray than the Milky Way extinction law's slope, and by the absence of the 2175 A dust feature. Remarkably, the difference in optical depth between the Balmer emission lines H$_{alpha}$ and H$_{beta}$ is about a factor of 2 larger than the difference in the optical depth between the continuum underlying the two Balmer lines. We interpret this discrepancy as a consequence of the fact that the hot ionizing stars are associated with dustier regions than the cold stellar population is. The absence of the 2175 A dust feature can be due either to the effects of the scattering and clumpiness of the dust or to a chemical composition different from that of the Milky Way dust grains. Disentangling the two interpretations is not easy because of the complexity of the spatial distribution of the emitting regions. The extinction law of the UV and optical spectral continua of extended regions can be applied to the spectra of medium- and high-redshift galaxies, where extended regions of a galaxy are, by necessity, sampled.},

  abstract      = {<BR /> Aims: We aim to test the impact of using variable star-forming histories (SFHs) and the IR luminosity as a constrain on the physical parameters of high redshift dusty star-forming galaxies. We explore in particular the properties (SFHs, ages, timescales) of galaxies depending on their belonging to the ``main sequence'' of star-forming galaxies (MS). <BR /> Methods: We performed spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of the UV-to-NIR and FIR emissions of a moderately large sample of GOODS-Herschel galaxies, for which rich multi-wavelength, optical to IR observations are available. We tested different SFHs and the impact of imposing energy conservation in the SED fitting process, to help with issues like the age-extinction degeneracy and produce SEDs consistent with observations. <BR /> Results: Our simple models produce well constrained SEDs for the broad majority of the sample (84\%), with the notable exception of the very high L$_{IR}$ end, for which we have indications that the energy conservation hypothesis cannot hold true for a single component population approach. We observe trends in the preferences in SFHs among our sources depending on stellar mass M$_{⋆}$ and z. Trends also emerge in the characteristic timescales of the SED models depending on the location on the SFR - M$_{⋆}$ diagram. We show that whilst using the same available observational data, we can produce galaxies less star-forming than classically inferred, if we allow rapidly declining SFHs, while properly reproducing their observables. These sources, representing 7\% of the sample, can be post-starbursts undergoing quenching, and their SFRs are potentially overestimated if inferred from their L$_{IR}$. Based on the trends observed in the rising SFH fits we explore a simple evolution model for stellar mass build-up over the considered time period. <BR /> Conclusions: Our approach successfully breaks the age-extinction degeneracy, and enables to evaluate properly the SFRs of the sources in the SED fitting process. Fitting without the IR constrain leads to a strong preference for declining SFHs, while its inclusion increases the preference of rising SFHs, more so at high z, in tentative agreement with the cosmic star-formation history (CSFH), although this result suffers from poor statistics. Keeping in mind that the sample is biased toward high luminosities and intense star formation, the evolution shaped by our model appears as both bursty (in its early stages) and steady-lasting (later on). The SFH of the sample considered as a whole follows the CSFH with a surprisingly small scatter, and is compatible with other studies supporting that the more massive galaxies have built most of their mass earlier than lower mass galaxies.},

After converting all observations to a common set of calibrations, we find a remarkable consensus among MS observations (~0.1 dex 1σ interpublication scatter). By fitting for time evolution of the MS in bins of constant mass, we deconvolve the observed scatter about the MS within each observed redshift bin. After accounting for observed scatter between different SFR indicators, we find the width of the MS distribution is ~0.2 dex and remains constant over cosmic time. Our best fits indicate the slope of the MS is likely time-dependent, with our best-fit log SFR( M * , t ) = (0.84 ± 0.02 – 0.026 ± 0.003 × t )log M * – (6.51 ± 0.24 – 0.11 ± 0.03 × t ), where t is the age of the universe in Gyr. We use our fits to create empirical evolutionary tracks in order to constrain MS galaxy star formation histories (SFHs), finding that (1) the most accurate representations of MS SFHs are given by delayed-τ models, (2) the decline in fractional stellar mass growth for a "typical" MS galaxy today is approximately linear for most of its lifetime, and (3) scatter about the MS can be generated by galaxies evolving along identical evolutionary tracks assuming an initial 1σ spread in formation times of ~1.4 Gyr.},

We determine structural parameters based on I-band imaging using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) equatorial Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 (CS82) survey ({\tilde}170 deg$^{2}$) taking advantage of an exquisite median seeing of {\tilde}0.6 arcsec. We select compact massive (M$_{⋆}$ $\gt$ 5 {\times} 10$^{10}$ M$_{⊙}$) galaxies within the redshift range of 0.2 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 0.6. The large volume sampled allows to decrease the effect of cosmic variance that has hampered the calculation of the number density for this enigmatic population in many previous studies. We undertake an exhaustive analysis in an effort to untangle the various findings inherent to the diverse definition of compactness present in the literature. We find that the absolute number of compact galaxies is very dependent on the adopted definition and can change up to a factor of $\gt$10. We systematically measure a factor of {\tilde}5 more compacts at the same redshift than what was previously reported on smaller fields with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, which are more affected by cosmic variance. This means that the decrease in number density from z {\tilde} 1.5 to z {\tilde} 0.2 might be only of a factor of {\tilde}2-5, significantly smaller than what was previously reported. This supports progenitor bias as the main contributor to the size evolution. This milder decrease is roughly compatible with the predictions from recent numerical simulations. Only the most extreme compact galaxies, with R$_{eff}$ $\lt$ 1.5 {\times} (M$_{⋆}$/10$^{11}$ M$_{⊙}$)$^{0.75}$ and M$_{⋆}$ $\gt$ 10$^{10.7}$ M$_{⊙}$, appear to drop in number by a factor of {\tilde}20 and hence likely experience a noticeable size evolution.},

Motivated by results from the First Billion Years (FiBY) simulation project, we argue that the intrinsic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of star-forming galaxies at these redshifts have a self-similar shape across the mass range 8.2 {\le} log (M$_{⋆}$/M$_{⊙}$) {\le} 10.6 probed by our sample. Using FiBY data, we construct a set of intrinsic SED templates which incorporate both detailed star formation and chemical abundance histories, and a variety of stellar population synthesis (SPS) model assumptions. With this set of intrinsic SEDs, we present a novel approach for directly recovering the shape and normalization of the dust attenuation curve. We find, across all of the intrinsic templates considered, that the average attenuation curve for star-forming galaxies at z {\sime} 3.5 is similar in shape to the commonly adopted Calzetti starburst law, with an average total-to-selective attenuation ratio of R$_{V}$ = 4.18 {\plusmn} 0.29. In contrast, we find that an average attenuation curve as steep as the SMC extinction law is strongly disfavoured. We show that the optical attenuation (A$_{V}$) versus stellar mass (M$_{⋆}$) relation predicted using our method is consistent with recent ALMA observations of galaxies at 2 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3 in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), as well as empirical A$_{V}$ - M$_{⋆}$ relations predicted by a Calzetti-like law. In fact, our results, combined with other literature data, suggest that the A$_{V}$-M$_{⋆}$ relation does not evolve over the redshift range 0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 5, at least for galaxies with log(M$_{⋆}$/M$_{⊙}$) {\gsim} 9.5. Finally, we present tentative evidence which suggests that the attenuation curve may become steeper at lower masses log(M$_{⋆}$/M$_{⊙}$) {\lsim} 9.0.},

The survey has obtained ultra-deep optical (0.48 $\lt$ lambda $\lt$ 1.0 micron) spectroscopy of \~{}2100 galaxies within the redshift interval 1.0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 7.0, over a total area of \~{}0.2 sq. degrees centred on the CANDELS UDS and CDFS fields. Based on accurate photometric redshift pre-selection, 85\% of the galaxies targeted by VANDELS were selected to be at z$\gt$=3. Exploiting the red sensitivity of the refurbished VIMOS spectrograph, the fundamental aim of the survey is to provide the high signal-to-noise ratio spectra necessary to measure key physical properties such as stellar population ages, masses, metallicities and outflow velocities from detailed absorption-line studies. Using integration times calculated to produce an approximately constant signal-to-noise ratio (20 $\lt$ t\_int $\lt$ 80 hours), the VANDELS survey targeted: a) bright star-forming galaxies at 2.4 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 5.5, b) massive quiescent galaxies at 1.0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2.5, c) fainter star-forming galaxies at 3.0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 7.0 and d) X-ray/Spitzer-selected active galactic nuclei and Herschel-detected galaxies. By targeting two extragalactic survey fields with superb multi-wavelength imaging data, VANDELS will produce a unique legacy data set for exploring the physics underpinning high-redshift galaxy evolution. In this paper we provide an overview of the VANDELS survey designed to support the science exploitation of the first ESO public data release, focusing on the scientific motivation, survey design and target selection.},

VANDELS' main targets are star-forming galaxies at 2.4$\lt$z$\lt$5.5 and massive passive galaxies at 1$\lt$z$\lt$2.5. By adopting a strategy of ultra-long exposure times, from 20 to 80 hours per source, VANDELS is designed to be the deepest ever spectroscopic survey of the high-redshift Universe. Exploiting the red sensitivity of the VIMOS spectrograph, the survey has obtained ultra-deep spectra covering the wavelength 4800-10000 A with sufficient signal-to-noise to investigate the astrophysics of high-redshift galaxy evolution via detailed absorption line studies. The VANDELS-DR1 is the release of all spectra obtained during the first season of observations and includes data for galaxies for which the total (or half of the total) scheduled integration time was completed. The release contains 879 individual objects with a measured redshift and includes fully wavelength and flux-calibrated 1D spectra, the associated error spectra, sky spectra and wavelength-calibrated 2D spectra. We also provide a catalog with the essential galaxy parameters, including spectroscopic redshifts and redshift quality flags. In this paper we present the survey layout and observations, the data reduction and redshift measurement procedure and the general properties of the VANDELS-DR1 sample. We also discuss the spectroscopic redshift distribution, the accuracy of the photometric redshifts and we provide some examples of data products. All VANDELS-DR1 data are publicly available and can be retrieved from the ESO archive. Two further data releases are foreseen in the next 2 years with a final release scheduled for June 2020 which will include improved re-reduction of the entire spectroscopic data set. (abridged)},

We detect compact, star-forming galaxies (cSFGs) whose number densities, masses, sizes, and star formation rates (SFRs) qualify them as likely progenitors of compact, quiescent, massive galaxies (cQGs) at z = 1.5-3. At z $\gt$\~{} 2, cSFGs present SFR = 100-200 M $_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$, yet their specific star formation rates (sSFR \~{} 10$^{-9}$ yr$^{-1}$) are typically half that of other massive SFGs at the same epoch, and host X-ray luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs) 30 times (\~{}30\%) more frequently. These properties suggest that cSFGs are formed by gas-rich processes (mergers or disk-instabilities) that induce a compact starburst and feed an AGN, which, in turn, quench the star formation on dynamical timescales (few 10$^{8}$ yr). The cSFGs are continuously being formed at z = 2-3 and fade to cQGs down to z \~{} 1.5. After this epoch, cSFGs are rare, thereby truncating the formation of new cQGs. Meanwhile, down to z = 1, existing cQGs continue to enlarge to match local QGs in size, while less-gas-rich mergers and other secular mechanisms shepherd (larger) SFGs as later arrivals to the red sequence. In summary, we propose two evolutionary tracks of QG formation: an early (z $\gt$\~{} 2), formation path of rapidly quenched cSFGs fading into cQGs that later enlarge within the quiescent phase, and a late-arrival (z $\lt$\~{} 2) path in which larger SFGs form extended QGs without passing through a compact state.},

  abstract      = {We use cosmological simulations to study a characteristic evolution pattern of high-redshift galaxies. Early, stream-fed, highly perturbed, gas-rich discs undergo phases of dissipative contraction into compact, star-forming systems (`blue' nuggets) at z {\tilde} 4-2. The peak of gas compaction marks the onset of central gas depletion and inside-out quenching into compact ellipticals (red nuggets) by z {\tilde} 2. These are sometimes surrounded by gas rings or grow extended dry stellar envelopes. The compaction occurs at a roughly constant specific star formation rate (SFR), and the quenching occurs at a constant stellar surface density within the inner kpc ({$\Sigma$}$_{1}$). Massive galaxies quench earlier, faster, and at a higher {$\Sigma$}$_{1}$ than lower mass galaxies, which compactify and attempt to quench more than once. This evolution pattern is consistent with the way galaxies populate the SFR-size-mass space, and with gradients and scatter across the main sequence. The compaction is triggered by an intense inflow episode, involving (mostly minor) mergers, counter-rotating streams or recycled gas, and is commonly associated with violent disc instability. The contraction is dissipative, with the inflow rate $\gt$SFR, and the maximum {$\Sigma$}$_{1}$ anticorrelated with the initial spin parameter. The central quenching is triggered by the high SFR and stellar/supernova feedback (maybe also active galactic nucleus feedback) due to the high central gas density, while the central inflow weakens as the disc vanishes. Suppression of fresh gas supply by a hot halo allows the long-term maintenance of quenching once above a threshold halo mass, inducing the quenching downsizing.},

In this investigation, the results from 11 participants, each using a different combination of photometric redshift code, template spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and priors, are used to examine the properties of photometric redshifts applied to deep fields with broadband multi-wavelength coverage. The photometry used includes U-band through mid-infrared filters and was derived using the TFIT method. Comparing the results, we find that there is no particular code or set of template SEDs that results in significantly better photometric redshifts compared to others. However, we find that codes producing the lowest scatter and outlier fraction utilize a training sample to optimize photometric redshifts by adding zero-point offsets, template adjusting, or adding extra smoothing errors. These results therefore stress the importance of the training procedure. We find a strong dependence of the photometric redshift accuracy on the signal-to-noise ratio of the photometry. On the other hand, we find a weak dependence of the photometric redshift scatter with redshift and galaxy color. We find that most photometric redshift codes quote redshift errors (e.g., 68\% confidence intervals) that are too small compared to that expected from the spectroscopic control sample. We find that all codes show a statistically significant bias in the photometric redshifts. However, the bias is in all cases smaller than the scatter; the latter therefore dominates the errors. Finally, we find that combining results from multiple codes significantly decreases the photometric redshift scatter and outlier fraction. We discuss different ways of combining data to produce accurate photometric redshifts and error estimates.},

The optical/NIR and far-IR Spitzer/Herschel colors indicate that most compact SFGs are heavily obscured. Nearly half (47\%) host an X-ray-bright active galactic nucleus (AGN). In contrast, only about 10\% of other massive galaxies at that time host AGNs. Compact SFGs have centrally concentrated light profiles and spheroidal morphologies similar to quiescent galaxies and are thus strikingly different from other SFGs, which typically are disk-like and sometimes clumpy or irregular. Most compact SFGs lie either within the star formation rate (SFR)-mass main sequence (65\%) or below it (30\%), on the expected evolutionary path toward quiescent galaxies. These results show conclusively that galaxies become more compact before they lose their gas and dust, quenching star formation. Using extensive HST photometry from CANDELS and grism spectroscopy from the 3D-HST survey, we model their stellar populations with either exponentially declining ({$\tau$}) star formation histories (SFHs) or physically motivated SFHs drawn from semianalytic models (SAMs). SAMs predict longer formation timescales and older ages \~{}2 Gyr, which are nearly twice as old as the estimates of the {$\tau$} models. Both models yield good spectral energy distribution fits, indicating that the systematic uncertainty in the age due to degeneracies in the SFH is of that order of magnitude. However, SAM SFHs better match the observed slope and zero point of the SFR-mass main sequence. Contrary to expectations, some low-mass compact SFGs (log(M/M $_{⊙}$) =10-10.6) have younger ages but lower specific SFRs than that of more massive galaxies, suggesting that the low-mass galaxies reach the red sequence faster. If the progenitors of compact SFGs are extended SFGs, state-of-the-art SAMs show that mergers and disk instabilities (DIs) are both able to shrink galaxies, but DIs are more frequent (60\% versus 40\%) and form more concentrated galaxies. We confirm this result via high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations.},

  abstract      = {This is the first in a series of papers examining the demographics of star-forming galaxies at $0.2\ltz\lt2.5$ in CANDELS. We study 9,100 galaxies from GOODS-S and UDS having published values of redshifts, masses, star-formation rates (SFRs), and dust attenuation ($A\_V$) derived from UV-optical SED fitting. In agreement with previous works, we find that the $UVJ$ colors of a galaxy are closely correlated with its specific star-formation rate (SSFR) and $A\_V$. We define rotated $UVJ$ coordinate axes, termed $S\_\mathrm{SED}$ and $C\_\mathrm{SED}$, that are parallel and perpendicular to the star-forming sequence and derive a quantitative calibration that predicts SSFR from $C\_\mathrm{SED}$ with an accuracy of \~{}0.2 dex. SFRs from UV-optical fitting and from UV+IR values based on Spitzer/MIPS 24 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ agree well overall, but systematic differences of order 0.2 dex exist at high and low redshifts. A novel plotting scheme conveys the evolution of multiple galaxy properties simultaneously, and dust growth, as well as star-formation decline and quenching, exhibit ``mass-accelerated evolution'' (``downsizing''). A population of transition galaxies below the star-forming main sequence is identified. These objects are located between star-forming and quiescent galaxies in $UVJ$ space and have lower $A\_V$ and smaller radii than galaxies on the main sequence. Their properties are consistent with their being in transit between the two regions. The relative numbers of quenched, transition, and star-forming galaxies are given as a function of mass and redshift.},

  abstract      = {We present spatially resolved Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 870 {$\mu$}m dust continuum maps of six massive, compact, dusty star-forming galaxies at z {\tilde} 2.5. These galaxies are selected for their small rest-frame optical sizes ($\{$r$\}$$_{{{e,F160W}$$\}$$\}${\tilde} 1.6 kpc) and high stellar mass densities that suggest that they are direct progenitors of compact quiescent galaxies at z {\tilde} 2. The deep observations yield high far-infrared (FIR) luminosities of $\{$L$\}$$_{{{IR}$$\}$$\}$=$\{$10$\}$$^{12.3-12.8}$ $\{$L$\}$$_{⊙ }$ and star formation rates (SFRs) of SFR = 200-700 M $_{⊙}$ yr$^{-1}$, consistent with those of typical star-forming {\ldquo}main sequence{\rdquo} galaxies. The high spatial resolution (FWHM {\tilde} 0.{\Prime}12-0.{\Prime}18) ALMA and Hubble Space Telescope photometry are combined to construct deconvolved, mean radial profiles of their stellar mass and (UV+IR) SFR. We find that the dusty, nuclear IR-SFR overwhelmingly dominates the bolometric SFR up to r {\tilde} 5 kpc, by a factor of over 100{\times} from the unobscured UV-SFR. Furthermore, the effective radius of the mean SFR profile ($\{$r$\}$$_{{{e,SFR}$$\}$$\}${\tilde} 1 kpc) is {\tilde}30\% smaller than that of the stellar mass profile. The implied structural evolution, if such nuclear starburst last for the estimated gas depletion time of {$\Delta$}t = {\plusmn}100 Myr, is a 4{\times} increase of the stellar mass density within the central 1 kpc and a 1.6{\times} decrease of the half-mass-radius. This structural evolution fully supports dissipation-driven, formation scenarios in which strong nuclear starbursts transform larger, star-forming progenitors into compact quiescent galaxies.}}}}},
