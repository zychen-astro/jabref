We trace the bimodality of the distribution from luminous to faint galaxies by fitting double Gaussians to the color functions separated in absolute magnitude bins. Color-magnitude (CM) relations are obtained for red and blue distributions (early- and late-type, predominantly field, galaxies) without using any cut in morphology. Instead, the analysis is based on the assumption of normal Gaussian distributions in color. We find that the CM relations are well fitted by a straight line plus a tanh function. Both relations can be described by a shallow CM trend (slopes of about -0.04, -0.05) plus a steeper transition in the average galaxy properties over about 2 mag. The midpoints of the transitions ( M r = -19.8 and -20.8 for the red and blue distributions, respectively) occur around 2 × 10 10 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/calM.gif] {Script M} ☉ after converting luminosities to stellar mass. Separate luminosity functions are obtained for the two distributions. The red distribution has a more luminous characteristic magnitude and a shallower faint-end slope ( M * = -21.5, α = -0.8) compared to the blue distribution (α ≈ -1.3, depending on the parameterization). These are approximately converted to galaxy stellar mass functions. The red distribution galaxies have a higher number density per magnitude for masses greater than about 3 × 10 10 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/calM.gif] {Script M} ☉ . Using a simple merger model, we show that the differences between the two functions are consistent with the red distribution being formed from major galaxy mergers.},

Modest mass growth by a factor of ~2 of individual quiescent galaxies can explain roughly half of the strong density evolution at masses >10 11 M ☉ , due to the steepness of the exponential tail of the mass function. The rest of the density evolution of massive, quiescent galaxies is likely due to transformation (e.g., quenching) of the massive star-forming population, a conclusion which is consistent with the density evolution we observe for the star-forming galaxies themselves, which is flat or decreasing with cosmic time. Modest mass growth does not explain the evolution of less massive quiescent galaxies (~10 10.5 M ☉ ), which show a similarly steep increase in their number densities. The less massive quiescent galaxies are therefore continuously formed by transforming galaxies from the star-forming population.},

Galaxies with reliable signs of SF form a distinct "main sequence" (MS), with a limited range of SFRs at a given M * and z (1 σ ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} ±0.3 dex), and log(SFR) approximately proportional to log M * . The range of log(SFR) remains constant to z > 1, while the MS as a whole moves to higher SFR as z increases. The range of the SFR along the MS constrains the amplitude of episodic variations of SF and the effect of mergers on the SFR. Typical galaxies spend ~67%(95%) of their lifetime since z = 1 within a factor of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} 2(4) of their average SFR at a given M * and z . The dominant mode of the evolution of SF since z ~ 1 is apparently a gradual decline of the average SFR in most individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of starburst episodes, or a decreasing factor by which SFRs are enhanced in starbursts. LIRGs at z ~ 1 seem to mostly reflect the high SFR typical for massive galaxies at that epoch. The smooth MS may reflect that the same set of few physical processes governs SF prior to additional quenching processes. A gradual process like gas exhaustion may play a dominant role.},

Throughout this study our emphasis is on the properties of galaxies on and off of a local "star-forming sequence." We discuss how the physical characteristics of galaxies along this sequence are related to scaling relations typically derived for galaxies of different morphological types. We find, among other trends, that our measure of the star formation rate surface density, Σ SFR , is nearly constant along this sequence. We discuss this result and implications for galaxies at higher redshift. For the first time, we report on measurements of the local UV luminosity function versus galaxy structural parameters, as well as inclination. We also split our sample into disk-dominated and bulge-dominated subsamples using the i -band Sersic index and find that disk-dominated galaxies occupy a very tight locus in SFR/ M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/star.gif] {star} vs. M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/star.gif] {star} space, while bulge-dominated galaxies display a much larger spread of SFR/ M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/star.gif] {star} at fixed stellar mass. A significant fraction of galaxies with SFR/ M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/star.gif] {star} and Σ SFR above those on the "star-forming sequence" are bulge-dominated. We can use our derived distribution functions to ask whether a significant fraction of these galaxies may be experiencing a final episode of star formation (possibly induced by a merger or other burst), soon to be quenched, by determining whether this population can explain the growth rate of the non-star-forming galaxies on the "red sequence." We find that this is a plausible scenario for bulge-dominated galaxies near the characteristic transition mass under reasonable assumptions regarding quenching timescales. Similarly, we use this technique to estimate the rate of mergers/starbursts that take galaxies off of the star-forming sequence and show that the implied merger rates are consistent with local measurements.},

  abstract = {The DEEP2 and COMBO-17 surveys are compared to study luminosity functions of red and blue galaxies to z ~ 1. The two surveys have different methods and sensitivities, but nevertheless results agree. After z ~ 1, M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/665/1/265/img1.gif] {img1.gif} has dimmed by 1.2-1.3 mag for all colors of galaxies, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/phi.gif] {phi} * for blue galaxies has hardly changed, and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/phi.gif] {phi} * for red galaxies has at least doubled (our formal value is ~0.5 dex). Luminosity density j B has fallen by 0.6 dex for blue galaxies but has remained nearly constant for red galaxies. These results imply that the number and total stellar mass of blue galaxies have been substantially constant since z ~ 1, whereas those of red galaxies (near L *) have been significantly rising. To explain the new red galaxies, a ``mixed'' scenario is proposed in which star formation in blue cloud galaxies is quenched, causing them to migrate to the red sequence, where they merge further in a small number of stellar mergers. This mixed scenario matches the local boxy-disky transition for nearby ellipticals, as well as red sequence stellar population scaling laws such as the color-magnitude and Mg-σ relations (which are explained as fossil relics from blue progenitors). Blue galaxies enter the red sequence via different quenching modes, each of which peaks at a different characteristic mass and time. The red sequence therefore likely builds up in different ways at different times and masses, and the concept of a single process that is ``downsizing'' (or upsizing) probably does not apply. Our claim in this paper of a rise in the number of red galaxies applies to galaxies near L *. Accurate counts of brighter galaxies on the steep part of the Schechter function require more accurate photometry than is currently available.},

The sample consists of galaxies with redshifts and optical photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) main galaxy sample matched with detections in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) and far-ultraviolet (FUV) bands in the Medium Imaging Survey being carried out by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer ( GALEX ) satellite. In the (NUV − r ) 0.1 versus M r ,0.1 galaxy color-magnitude diagram, the galaxies separate into two well-defined blue and red sequences. The (NUV − r ) 0.1 color distribution at each M r ,0.1 is not well fit by the sum of two Gaussians due to an excess of galaxies in between the two sequences. The peaks of both sequences become redder with increasing luminosity, with a distinct blue peak visible up to M r ,0.1 ~ − 23. The r 0.1 -band luminosity functions vary systematically with color, with the faint-end slope and characteristic luminosity gradually increasing with color. After correcting for attenuation due to dust, we find that approximately one-quarter of the color variation along the blue sequence is due to dust, with the remainder due to star formation history and metallicity. Finally, we present the distribution of galaxies as a function of specific star formation rate and stellar mass. The specific star formation rates imply that galaxies along the blue sequence progress from low-mass galaxies with star formation rates that increase somewhat with time to more massive galaxies with a more or less constant star formation rate. Above a stellar mass of ~10 10.5 M ☉ , galaxies with low ratios of current to past averaged star formation rate begin to dominate.},

The data indicate that the high specific SF rates (SFRs) of many less massive galaxies do not represent late, irregular or recurrent, starbursts in evolved galaxies. They rather seem to reflect the onset (initial burst) of the dominant SF episode of galaxies, after which SF gradually declines on gigayear timescales to z = 0 and forms the bulk of a galaxy's M * . With decreasing mass, this onset of major SF shifts to decreasing z for an increasing fraction of galaxies ( staged galaxy formation ). This process may be an important component of the "downsizing" phenomenon. We find that the predominantly gradual decline of SFRs described by Noeske et al. can be reproduced by exponential SF histories ( τ models ), if less massive galaxies have systematically longer e -folding times τ, and a later onset of SF ( z f ). Our model can provide a first parameterization of SFR as a function of M * and z , and quantify mass dependences of τ and z f , from direct observations of M * and SFRs up to z > 1. The observed evolution of SF in galaxies can plausibly reflect the dominance of gradual gas exhaustion. The data are also consistent with the history of cosmological accretion onto dark matter halos.},

We combine the infrared data with redshifts, rest-frame luminosities, and colors from COMBO-17 and with morphologies from Hubble Space Telescope images collected by the Galaxy Evolution from Morphology and SEDs (GEMS) and Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) projects. To characterize the decline in star formation rate (SFR) since z ~ 0.7, we estimate the total thermal IR luminosities, SFRs, and stellar masses for the galaxies in this sample. At z ~ 0.7, nearly 40% of intermediate- and high-mass galaxies (with stellar masses ≥2 × 10 10 M ☉ ) are undergoing a period of intense star formation above their past-averaged SFR. In contrast, less than 1% of equally massive galaxies in the local universe have similarly intense star formation activity. Morphologically undisturbed galaxies dominate the total infrared luminosity density and SFR density: at z ~ 0.7, more than half of the intensely star-forming galaxies have spiral morphologies, whereas less than ~30% are strongly interacting. Thus, a decline in major merger rate is not the underlying cause of the rapid decline in cosmic SFR since z ~ 0.7. Physical properties that do not strongly affect galaxy morphology—for example, gas consumption and weak interactions with small satellite galaxies—appear to be responsible.},

We find that the IRX-corrected FUV luminosities are tightly and linearly correlated with the attenuation-corrected Hα luminosities (as measured from the Balmer decrement), with an rms scatter of ±0.09 dex. The ratios of these attenuation-corrected FUV to Hα luminosities are consistent with evolutionary synthesis model predictions, assuming a constant star formation rate over 100 Myr, solar metallicity, and either a Salpeter or a Kroupa initial mass function with lower and upper mass limits of 0.1 and100 M ☉ . The IRX-corrected FUV to Balmer-corrected Hα luminosity ratios do not show any trend with other galactic properties over the ranges covered by our sample objects. In contrast, FUV attenuation derived from the FUV-NUV color (UV spectral slope) show much larger random and systematic uncertainties. When compared to either Balmer-corrected Hα luminosities or IRX-corrected FUV luminosities the color-corrected FUV luminosities show ~2.5 times larger rms scatter, and systematic nonlinear deviations as functions of luminosity and other parameters. Linear combinations of 25 μm and 1.4 GHz radio continuum luminosities with the observed FUV luminosities are also well correlated with the Balmer-corrected Hα luminosities. These results provide useful prescriptions for deriving attenuation-corrected star formation rates of galaxies based on linear combinations of UV and IR or radio luminosities, which are presented in convenient tabular form. Comparisons of our calibrations with attenuation corrections in the literature and with dust attenuation laws are also made.},

Our results are as follows. (1) Among ~790 high-mass ( M ≥ 2.5 × 10 10 M ☉ ) galaxies, the visually based merger fraction over z ~ 0.24-0.80, ranges from 9% ± 5% to 8% ± 2%. Lower limits on the major merger and minor merger fraction over this interval range from 1.1% to 3.5%, and 3.6% to 7.5%, respectively. This is the first, albeit approximate, empirical estimate of the frequency of minor mergers over the last 7 Gyr. Assuming a visibility timescale of ~0.5 Gyr, it follows that over T b ~ 3-7 Gyr, ~68% of high-mass systems have undergone a merger of mass ratio >1/10, with ~16%, 45%, and 7% of these corresponding respectively to major, minor, and ambiguous "major or minor" mergers. The average merger rate is ~ a few ×10 –4 galaxies Gyr –1 Mpc –3 . Among ~2840 blue-cloud galaxies of mass M ≥ 1.0 × 10 9 M ☉ , similar results hold. (2) We compare the empirical merger fraction and merger rate for high-mass galaxies to three Λ cold dark matter-based models: halo occupation distribution models, semi-analytic models, and hydrodynamic SPH simulations. We find qualitative agreement between observations and models such that the (major+minor) merger fraction or rate from different models bracket the observations, and show a factor of 5 dispersion. Near-future improvements can now start to rule out certain merger scenarios. (3) Among ~3698 M ≥ 1.0 × 10 9 M ☉ galaxies, we find that the mean star formation rate (SFR) of visibly merging systems is only modestly enhanced compared to non-interacting galaxies over z ~ 0.24-0.80. Visibly merging systems only account for a small fraction (<30%) of the cosmic SFR density over T b ~ 3-7 Gyr. This complements the results of Wolf et al. over a shorter time interval of T b ~ 6.2-6.8 Gyr, and suggests that the behavior of the cosmic SFR density over the last 7 Gyr is predominantly shaped by non-interacting galaxies.},

We summarize the observational aspects of the survey as motivated by the scientific goals and present a detailed description of the data reduction procedures and products from the survey. Our data reduction methods utilize the most up-to-date calibration files and image combination procedures. We have paid special attention to correcting a range of instrumental effects, including charge transfer efficiency degradation for ACS, removal of electronic bias-striping present in ACS data after Servicing Mission 4, and persistence effects and other artifacts in WFC3/IR. For each field, we release mosaics for individual epochs and eventual mosaics containing data from all epochs combined, to facilitate photometric variability studies and the deepest possible photometry.

  abstract = {The mid-infrared local luminosity function is evolved with redshift to fit the spectrum of the cosmic infrared background (CIRB) at λ > 5 μm and the galaxy counts from various surveys at mid-infrared, far-infrared, and submillimeter wavelengths. A variety of evolutionary models provide satisfactory fits to the CIRB and the number counts. The degeneracy in the range of models cannot be broken by current observations. However, the different evolutionary models yield approximately the same comoving number density of infrared luminous galaxies as a function of redshift. Since the spectrum of the cosmic background at λ > 200 μm is quite sensitive to the evolution at high redshift, i.e., z > 1, all models that fit the counts require a flattening at z ~ 0.8 to avoid overproducing the CIRB. About 80% of the 140 μm CIRB is produced at 0 < z < 1.5, while only about 30% of the 850 μm background is produced within the same redshift range. The nature of the evolution is then translated into a measure of the dust-enshrouded star formation rate (SFR) density as a function of redshift and compared with estimates from rest-frame optical/ultraviolet surveys. The dust-enshrouded SFR density appears to peak at z = 0.8 ± 0.1, much sooner than previously thought, with a value of 0.25 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/556/2/562/img1.gif] {img1.gif} M ☉ yr -1 Mpc -3 , and remains almost constant up to z ~ 2. At least 70% of this star formation takes place in infrared luminous galaxies with L IR > 10 11 L ☉ . The long-wavelength observations that constrain our evolutionary models do not strongly trace the evolution at z > 2 and a drop-off in the dust-enshrouded SFR density is consistent with both the CIRB spectrum and the number counts. However, a comparison with the infrared luminosity function derived from extinction-corrected rest-frame optical/ultraviolet observations of the Lyman break galaxy population at z ~ 3 suggests that the almost flat comoving SFR density seen between redshifts of 0.8 and 2 extends up to a redshift of z ~ 4.},

All these fields have a wealth of publicly available imaging data sets in addition to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data, which makes it possible to construct the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of objects over a wide wavelength range. In this paper we describe a photometric analysis of the CANDELS and 3D-HST HST imaging and the ancillary imaging data at wavelengths 0.3-8 μm. Objects were selected in the WFC3 near-IR bands, and their SEDs were determined by carefully taking the effects of the point-spread function in each observation into account. A total of 147 distinct imaging data sets were used in the analysis. The photometry is made available in the form of six catalogs: one for each field, as well as a master catalog containing all objects in the entire survey. We also provide derived data products: photometric redshifts, determined with the EAZY code, and stellar population parameters determined with the FAST code. We make all the imaging data that were used in the analysis available, including our reductions of the WFC3 imaging in all five fields. 3D-HST is a spectroscopic survey with the WFC3 and ACS grisms, and the photometric catalogs presented here constitute a necessary first step in the analysis of these grism data.

For massive galaxies, we find that the bulk of the star formation was completed prior to z = 2. However, for the lower mass galaxies, the luminosity-weighted ages are significantly younger. The differential change in mass-to-light ratio correlates closely with rest-frame color, consistent with recent star formation and associated growth. Our data are consistent with mass rather than environment governing the overall growth, contrary to the expectations of hierarchical assembly. We discuss how feedback, conduction, and galaxy interactions may explain the downsizing trends seen within our large sample.},

We identify a mass limit, M Q , above which star formation appears to be quenched and show that the physical mechanisms responsible for downsizing can thus be empirically quantified by charting the evolution in this threshold mass.

For the majority of galaxies near the median density, there is no significant correlation between downsizing and environment. However, a trend is observed in the comparison between environments that are more than 3 times overdense or underdense relative to the median. Here, downsizing appears accelerated in overdense regions that host higher numbers of massive, early-type galaxies as compared to the underdense regions. Our results significantly constrain recent suggestions for the origin of downsizing and indicate that the process for quenching star formation must, primarily, be internally driven.},

The SFR in the most massive galaxies ( M * > 10 10.8 M ☉ ) was 6 times higher at z = 2 than it is today. It drops steeply from z = 2, reaching the present-day value at z ~ 1. In contrast, the SFR density of intermediate-mass galaxies (10 10.2 M ☉ ≤ M * < 10 10.8 M ☉ ) declines more slowly and may peak or plateau at z ~ 1.5. We use the characteristic growth time t SFR ≡ ρ ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-4357/619/2/L135/img1.gif] {img1.gif} /ρ SFR to provide evidence of an associated transition in massive galaxies from a burst to a quiescent star formation mode at z ~ 2. Intermediate-mass systems transit from burst to quiescent mode at z ~ 1, while the lowest mass objects undergo bursts throughout our redshift range. Our results show unambiguously that the formation era for galaxies was extended and proceeded from high- to low-mass systems. The most massive galaxies formed most of their stars in the first ~3 Gyr of cosmic history. Intermediate-mass objects continued to form their dominant stellar mass for an additional ~2 Gyr, while the lowest mass systems have been forming over the whole cosmic epoch spanned by the GDDS. This view of galaxy formation clearly supports "downsizing" in the SFR where the most massive galaxies form first and galaxy formation proceeds from larger to smaller mass scales.},

We use a sample of BzK-selected star-forming galaxies, drawn from the Cosmic Evolution Survey, to perform a stacking analysis of their 1.4 GHz radio continuum as a function of different stellar population properties, after cleaning the sample from contamination by active galactic nuclei. Dust unbiased SFRs are derived from radio fluxes assuming the local radio-IR correlation. The main results of this work are: (1) specific star formation rate (SSFR)s are constant over about 1 dex in stellar mass and up to the highest stellar mass probed, (2) the dust attenuation is a strong function of galaxy stellar mass with more massive galaxies being more obscured than lower mass objects, (3) a single value of the UV extinction applied to all galaxies would lead to a gross underestimate of the SFR in massive galaxies, (4) correcting the observed UV luminosities for dust attenuation based on the Calzetti recipe provides results in very good agreement with the radio derived ones, (5) the mean SSFR of our sample steadily decreases by a factor of ~4 with decreasing redshift from z = 2.3 to 1.4 and a factor of ~40 down the local universe. These empirical SFRs would cause galaxies to dramatically overgrow in mass if maintained all the way to low redshifts; we suggest that this does not happen because star formation is progressively quenched, likely starting from the most massive galaxies.},

Outflows move into the surrounding intergalactic medium (IGM) and heat it sufficiently to prevent it from condensing onto galaxies. In the dense, high-redshift IGM, such feedback requires a highly energetic outflow, driven by a large AGN. However, in the more tenuous low-redshift IGM, equivalently strong feedback can be achieved by less energetic winds (and thus smaller galaxies). Using a simple analytic model, we show that this leads to the antihierarchical quenching of star formation in large galaxies, consistent with current observations. At redshifts prior to the formation of large AGNs, galaxy formation is hierarchical and follows the growth of dark matter halos. The transition between the two regimes lies at the z ≈ 2 peak of AGN activity..},

Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic “dark ages” to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z≈1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25\% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25\% formed after z = 0.7. Less than ∼1\% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization. },

  abstract = {A simple, observationally motivated model is presented for understanding how halo masses, galaxy stellar masses, and star formation rates are related, and how these relations evolve with time. The relation between halo mass and galaxy stellar mass is determined by matching the observed spatial abundance of galaxies to the expected spatial abundance of halos at multiple epochs, i.e., more massive galaxies are assigned to more massive halos at each epoch. This "abundance matching" technique has been shown previously to reproduce the observed luminosity and scale dependence of galaxy clustering over a range of epochs. Halos at different epochs are connected by halo mass accretion histories estimated from N -body simulations. The halo-galaxy connection at fixed epochs in conjunction with the connection between halos across time provides a connection between observed galaxies across time. With approximations for the impact of merging and accretion on the growth of galaxies, one can then directly infer the star formation histories of galaxies as a function of stellar and halo mass. This model is tuned to match both the observed evolution of the stellar mass function and the normalization of the observed star formation rate (SFR)-stellar mass relation to z ~ 1. The data demands, for example, that the star formation rate density is dominated by galaxies with M star ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 10 10.0-10.5 M ☉ from 0 < z < 1, and that such galaxies over these epochs reside in halos with M vir ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 10 11.5-12.5 M ☉ . The SFR-halo mass relation is approximately Gaussian over the range 0 < z < 1 with a mildly evolving mean and normalization. This model is then used to shed light on a number of issues, including (1) a clarification of "downsizing", (2) the lack of a sharp characteristic halo mass at which star formation is truncated, and (3) the dominance of star formation over merging to the stellar buildup of galaxies with M star ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 10 11 M ☉ at z < 1.},

A significant number of fainter sources (5 × 10 10 L ☉ ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} L IR ≤ 10 11 L ☉ ) are also detected at similar distances. We finally derive 15 μm and total IR luminosity functions (LFs) up to z ~ 1. In agreement with the previous results from the Infrared Space Observatory ( ISO ) and SCUBA and as expected from the MIPS source number counts, we find very strong evolution of the contribution of the IR-selected population with look-back time. Pure evolution in density is firmly excluded by the data, but we find considerable degeneracy between strict evolution in luminosity and a combination of increases in both density and luminosity [ L ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/632/1/169/img1.gif] {img1.gif} ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} (1 + z ) ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/632/1/169/img2.gif] {img2.gif} , ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/phi.gif] {phi} ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/632/1/169/img1.gif] {img1.gif} ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} (1 + z ) ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/632/1/169/img3.gif] {img3.gif} ]. A significant steepening of the faint-end slope of the IR luminosity function is also unlikely, as it would overproduce the faint 24 μm source number counts. Our results imply that the comoving IR energy density of the universe evolves as (1 + z ) 3.9±0.4 up to z ~ 1 and that galaxies luminous in the infrared (i.e., L IR ≥ 10 11 L ☉ ) are responsible for 70% ± 15% of this energy density at z ~ 1. Taking into account the contribution of the UV luminosity evolving as (1 + z ) ~2.5 , we infer that these IR-luminous sources dominate the star-forming activity beyond z ~ 0.7. The uncertainties affecting these conclusions are largely dominated by the errors in the k -corrections used to convert 24 μm fluxes into luminosities.},

  abstract    = {Using a novel approach, we study the quenching and bursting of galaxies as a function of stellar mass ($M_{*}$), local environment ($\Sigma$), and specific star-formation rate (sSFR) using a large spectroscopic sample of $\sim$ 123,000 $GALEX$/SDSS and $\sim$ 420 $GALEX$/COSMOS/LEGA-C galaxies to $z$ $\sim$ 1. We show that out to $z$ $\sim$ 1 and at fixed sSFR and local density, on average, less massive galaxies are quenching, whereas more massive systems are bursting, with a quenching/bursting transition at log($M_{*}$/$M_{\odot}$) $\sim$ 10.5-11 and likely a short quenching/bursting timescale ($\lesssim$ 300 Myr). We find that much of the bursting of star-formation happens in massive (log($M_{*}$/$M_{\odot}$) $\gtrsim$ 11), high sSFR galaxies (log(sSFR/Gyr$^{-1}$) $\gtrsim$ -2), particularly those in the field (log($\Sigma$/Mpc$^{-2}$) $\lesssim$ 0; and among group galaxies, satellites more than centrals). Most of the quenching of star-formation happens in low-mass (log($M_{*}$/$M_{\odot}$) $\lesssim$ 9), low sSFR galaxies (log(sSFR/Gyr$^{-1}$) $\lesssim$ -2), in particular those located in dense environments (log($\Sigma$/Mpc$^{-2}$) $\gtrsim$ 1), indicating the combined effects of $M_{*}$ and $\Sigma$ in quenching/bursting of galaxies since $z$ $\sim$ 1. However, we find that stellar mass has stronger effects than environment on recent quenching/bursting of galaxies to $z$ $\sim$ 1. At any given $M_{*}$, sSFR, and environment, centrals are quenchier (quenching faster) than satellites in an average sense. We also find evidence for the strength of mass and environmental quenching being stronger at higher redshift. Our preliminary results have potential implications for the physics of quenching/bursting in galaxies across cosmic time.},

Five of the eight galaxies are detected in both wave bands, and these data are used, in conjunction with IRAS archival photometry, to model the dust emission at λ ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {gtrsim} 40 μm. The FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are best fitted by a combination of two modified Planck functions, with T ~ 40-55 K (warm dust) and T ~ 20-23 K (cool dust) and with a dust emissivity index ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/epsi.gif] {epsilon} = 2. The cool dust can be a major contributor to the FIR emission of starburst galaxies, representing up to 60% of the total flux. This component is heated not only by the general interstellar radiation field, but also by the starburst itself. The cool dust mass is up to ~150 times larger than the warm dust mass, bringing the gas-to-dust ratios of the starbursts in our sample close to Milky Way values, once rescaled for the appropriate metallicity. The ratio between the total dust FIR emission in the range 1-1000 μm and the IRAS FIR emission in the range 40-120 μm is ~1.75, with small variations from galaxy to galaxy. This ratio is about 40% larger than previously inferred from data at millimeter wavelengths. Although the galaxies in our sample are generally classified as "UV bright," for four of them the UV energy emerging shortward of 0.2 μm is less than 15% of the FIR energy. On average, about 30% of the bolometric flux is coming out in the UV-to-near-IR wavelength range; the rest is emitted in the FIR. Energy balance calculations show that the FIR emission predicted by the dust reddening of the UV-to-near-IR stellar emission is within a factor of ~2 of the observed value in individual galaxies and within 20% when averaged over a large sample. If our sample of local starbursts is representative of high-redshift ( z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {gtrsim} 1), UV-bright, star-forming galaxies, these galaxies' FIR emission will be generally undetected in submillimeter surveys, unless (1) their bolometric luminosity is comparable to or larger than that of ultraluminous FIR galaxies and (2) their FIR SED contains a cool dust component.},

Through a stacking analysis we directly measure the 850-{\mu}m flux density of LBGs in our deep (0.9mJy) James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) SCUBA-2 850-{\mu}m map, as well as deep public Herschel/SPIRE 250-, 350- and 500-{\mu}m imaging. We establish functional forms for the IRX-{\beta} relation to z ~ 5, confirming that there is no significant redshift evolution of the relation and that the resulting average IRX-{\beta} curve is consistent with a Calzetti-like attenuation law. We compare our results with recent work in the literature, finding that discrepancies in the slope of the IRX-{\beta} relation are driven by biases in the methodology used to determine the ultraviolet slopes. Consistent results are found when IRX-{\beta} is evaluated by stacking in bins of stellar mass, M, and we argue that the near-linear IRX-M relationship is a better proxy for correcting observed UV luminosities to total star formation rates, provided an accurate handle on M can be had, and also gives clues as to the physical driver of the role of dust-obscured star formation in high-redshift galaxies.},

  title       = {A Radio Continuum Study of Dwarf Galaxies: 6 cm imaging of Little Things},
  abstract    = {In this paper we examine to what extent the radio continuum can be used as an extinction free probe of star formation in dwarf galaxies. To that aim we observe $40$ nearby dwarf galaxies with the Very Large Array at 6 cm ($4$-$8$ GHz) in C-configuration. We obtained images with $3$-$8^{\prime\prime}$ resolution and noise levels of $3$-$15{\rm \,\mu Jy\,beam^{-1}}$. We detected emission associated with $22$ of the $40$ dwarf galaxies, $8$ of which are new detections. The general picture is that of an interstellar medium largely devoid of radio continuum emission, interspersed by isolated pockets of emission associated with star formation. We find an average thermal fraction of $\sim 50$-$70$% and an average magnetic field strength of $\sim 5$-$8\,{\rm \mu G}$, only slightly lower than that found in larger, spiral galaxies. At 100 pc scales, we find surprisingly high values for the average magnetic field strength of up to 50$\,{\rm \mu G}$. We find that dwarf galaxies follow the theoretical predictions of the radio continuum-star formation rate relation within regions of significant radio continuum emission but that the non-thermal radio continuum is suppressed relative to the star formation rate when considering the entire optical disk. We examine the far-infrared-star formation rate relation for our sample and find that the far-infrared is suppressed compared to the expected star formation rate. We discuss explanations for these observed relations and the impact of our findings on the radio continuum-far-infrared relation. We conclude that radio continuum emission at centimetre wavelengths has the promise of being a largely extinction-free star formation rate indicator. We find that star formation rates of gas rich, low mass galaxies can be estimated with an uncertainty of $\pm 0.2$ dex between the values of $2 \times 10^{-4}$ and $0.1 {\rm M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$.},

  abstract    = {The deep, near-infrared narrow-band survey HiZELS has yielded robust samples of H-alpha emitting star-forming galaxies within narrow redshift slices at z = 0.8, 1.47 and 2.23. In this paper, we distinguish the stellar mass and star-formation rate (SFR) dependence of the clustering of these galaxies. At high stellar masses (M/M_sol>2x10^10), where HiZELS selects galaxies close to the so-called star-forming main sequence, the clustering strength is observed to increase strongly with stellar mass (in line with the results of previous studies of mass-selected galaxy samples) and also with SFR. These two dependencies are shown to hold independently. At lower stellar masses, however, where HiZELS probes high specific SFR galaxies, there is little or no dependence of the clustering strength on stellar mass, but the dependence on SFR remains: high-SFR low-mass galaxies are found in more massive dark matter haloes than their lower SFR counterparts. We argue that this is due to environmentally driven star formation in these systems. We apply the same selection criteria to the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We find that, in EAGLE, the high-SFR low-mass galaxies are central galaxies in more massive dark matter haloes, in which the high SFRs are driven by a (halo-driven) increased gas content.},

We study the dust properties of the whole disc of M33 at spatial scales of ~170 pc. This analysis allows us to infer how the relative dust grain abundance changes with the conditions of the ISM, study the existence of a submillimetre excess and look for trends of the gas-to-dust mass ratio (GDR) with other physical properties of the galaxy. For each pixel in the disc of M33 we fit the infrared SED using a physically motivated dust model that assumes an emissivity index beta close to 2. We derive the relative amount of the different dust grains in the model, the total dust mass, and the strength of the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) heating the dust at each spatial location. The relative abundance of very small grains tends to increase, and for big grains to decrease, at high values of Halpha luminosity. This shows that the dust grains are modified inside the star-forming regions, in agreement with a theoretical framework of dust evolution under different physical conditions. The radial dependence of the GDR is consistent with the shallow metallicity gradient observed in this galaxy. The strength of the ISRF derived in our model correlates with the star formation rate in the galaxy in a pixel by pixel basis. Although this is expected it is the first time that a correlation between both quantities is reported. We produce a map of submillimetre excess in the 500 microns SPIRE band for the disc of M33. The excess can be as high as 50% and increases at large galactocentric distances. We further study the relation of the excess with other physical properties of the galaxy and find that the excess is prominent in zones of diffuse ISM outside the main star-forming regions, where the molecular gas and dust surface density are low.},

  abstract    = {Galaxy integrated H{\alpha} star formation rate-stellar mass relation, or SFR(global)-M*(global) relation, is crucial for understanding star formation history and evolution of galaxies. However, many studies have dealt with SFR using unresolved measurements, which makes it difficult to separate out the contamination from other ionizing sources, such as active galactic nuclei and evolved stars. Using the integral field spectroscopic observations from SDSS-IV MaNGA, we spatially disentangle the contribution from different H{\alpha} powering sources for ~1000 galaxies. We find that, when including regions dominated by all ionizing sources in galaxies, the spatially-resolved relation between H{\alpha} surface density ({\Sigma}H{\alpha}(all)) and stellar mass surface density ({\Sigma}*(all)) progressively turns over at high {\Sigma}*(all) end for increasing M*(global) and bulge dominance (bulge-to-total light ratio, B/T). This in turn leads to the flattening of the integrated H{\alpha}(global)-M*(global) relation in the literature. By contrast, there is no noticeable flattening in both integrated H{\alpha}(HII)-M*(HII) and spatially-resolved {\Sigma}H{\alpha}(HII)-{\Sigma}*(HII) relations when only regions where star formation dominates the ionization are considered. In other words, the flattening can be attributed to the increasing regions powered by non-star-formation sources, which generally have lower ionizing ability than star formation. Analysis of the fractional contribution of non-star-formation sources to total H{\alpha} luminosity of a galaxy suggests a decreasing role of star formation as an ionizing source toward high-mass, high-B/T galaxies and bulge regions. This result indicates that the appearance of the galaxy integrated SFR-M* relation critically depends on their global properties (M*(global) and B/T) and relative abundances of various ionizing sources within the galaxies.},

Here we estimate the fraction of the bolometric infrared (IR) luminosity that can be attributed to AGNs by measuring and modeling the full ultraviolet to far-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) in up to 33 broad bands for 23 merging galaxies with the Code for Investigating Galaxy Emission. In addition to a sample of 11 confirmed AGN in late-stage mergers, found in the Infrared Array Satellite Revised Bright Galaxy Sample or Faint Source Catalog, our sample includes a comparison sample of 12 early-stage mergers from the $Spitzer$ Interacting Galaxies Survey. We perform identical SED modeling of simulated mergers to validate our methods, and we supplement the SED data with mid-IR spectra of diagnostic lines obtained with $Spitzer$ InfraRed Spectrograph. The estimated AGN contributions to the IR luminosities vary from system to system from 0% up to 93% but are significantly greater in the later-stage, more luminous mergers, consistent with what is known about galaxy evolution and AGN triggering.},

  abstract    = {Recent observations of our neighbouring galaxy M31 have revealed that its disk was shaped by widespread events. The evidence for this includes the high dispersion ($V/\sigma$ $\le$ 3) of stars older than 2 Gyr, and a global star formation episode, 2-4 Gyr ago. Using the modern hydrodynamical code, GIZMO, we have performed 300 high-resolution simulations to explore the extent to which these observed properties can be explained by a single merger. We find that the observed M31 disk resembles models having experienced a 4:1 merger, in which the nuclei coalesced 1.8-3 Gyr ago, and where the first passage took place 7 to 10 Gyr ago at a large pericentre distance (32 kpc). We also show that within a family of orbital parameters, the Giant Stream (GS) can be formed with various merger mass-ratios, from 2:1 to 300:1. A recent major merger may be the only way to create the very unusual age-dispersion relation in the disk. It reproduces and explains the long-lived 10 kpc ring, the widespread and recent star formation event, the absence of a remnant of the GS progenitor, the apparent complexity of the 3D spatial distribution of the GS, the NE and G Clumps and their formation process, and the observed slope of the halo profile. These modelling successes lead us to propose that the bulk of the substructure in the M31 halo, as well as the complexity of the inner galaxy, may be attributable to a single major interaction with a galaxy that has now fully coalesced with Andromeda.},

We select GAMA survey galaxies with $10.25<{\rm log}(M_*/M_\odot)<10.75$ and $z<0.2$ classified according to their intrinsic $u^*-r^*$ colour. From single component S\'ersic fits, we find that the stellar mass-sensitive $K-$band profiles of red and green galaxy populations are very similar, while $g-$band profiles indicate more disk-like morphologies for the green galaxies: apparent (optical) morphological differences arise primarily from radial mass-to-light ratio variations. Two-component fits show that most green galaxies have significant bulge and disk components and that the blue to red evolution is driven by colour change in the disk. Together, these strongly suggest that galaxies evolve from blue to red through secular disk fading and that a strong bulge is present prior to any decline in star formation. The relative abundance of the green population implies a typical timescale for traversing the green valley $\sim 1-2$~Gyr and is independent of environment, unlike that of the red and blue populations. While environment likely plays a r\^ole in triggering the passage across the green valley, it appears to have little effect on time taken. These results are consistent with a green valley population dominated by (early type) disk galaxies that are insufficiently supplied with gas to maintain previous levels of disk star formation, eventually attaining passive colours. No single event is needed quench their star formation.},

  abstract    = {Galaxies exhibit different clustering and quenching properties in clusters, filaments, and the field, but it is still uncertain whether such differences are imprints of the tidal environment on galaxy formation, or if they reflect the variation of the underlying halo mass function across the cosmic web. We measure the dependence of galaxy clustering and quenching on the cosmic web in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, characterized by the combination of spherical overdensity $\delta_8$ and tidal anisotropy $\alpha_5$ centred on each galaxy. We find that the galaxy clustering is a non-monotonic function of either $\delta_8$ or $\alpha_5$, and the large-scale galaxy bias shows complex and rich behaviour on the $\delta_8$ vs. $\alpha_5$ plane. Using the mean galaxy colour as a proxy for the average quenched level of galaxies, we find that galaxy quenching is primarily a function of $\delta_8$, with some subtle yet non-trivial dependence on $\alpha_5$ at fixed $\delta_8$. The quenched galaxies generally show stronger small-scale clustering than the star-forming ones at fixed $\delta_8$ or $\alpha_5$, while the characteristic scale at which the amplitude of clustering becomes comparable for both galaxy population varies with $\delta_8$ and $\alpha_5$. Remarkably, those observed cosmic web dependences of galaxy clustering and quenching can be well reproduced by a mock galaxy catalogue constructed from the iHOD model, which places quenched and star-forming galaxies inside dark matter haloes based on the stellar-to-halo mass relation and the halo quenching model --- the $\delta_8$ and $\alpha_5$ dependences of iHOD galaxies are solely derived from the cosmic web modulation of the halo mass function. The success of the simple iHOD model suggests that any direct effect of the large-scale tidal field on galaxy formation is not currently detectable.[Abridged]},

However, this process and the thermodynamic history of the gas have not been clearly characterized in connection with with the formation and evolution of the internal structure of dark-matter halos. We show that observational data of high-mass galaxy clusters lie on a plane in the three-dimensional logarithmic space of their characteristic radius $r_s$, mass $M_s$, and X-ray temperature $T_X$ with a very small orthogonal scatter. The tight correlation indicates that the gas temperature was determined at a specific cluster formation time, which is encoded in $r_s$ and $M_s$. The plane is tilted with respect to $T_X \propto M_s/r_s$, which is the plane expected in case of simplified virial equilibrium. We show that this tilt can be explained by a similarity solution, which indicates that clusters are not isolated but continuously growing through matter accretion from their outer environments. Numerical simulations reproduce the observed plane and its angle. This result holds independently of the gas physics implemented in the code, revealing the fundamental origin of this plane.},

  title       = {Not all stars form in clusters - measuring the kinematics of OB associations with $Gaia$},
  abstract    = {It is often stated that star clusters are the fundamental units of star formation and that most (if not all) stars form in dense stellar clusters. In this monolithic formation scenario, low density OB associations are formed from the expansion of gravitationally bound clusters following gas expulsion due to stellar feedback. $N$-body simulations of this process show that OB associations formed this way retain signs of expansion and elevated radial anisotropy over tens of Myr. However, recent theoretical and observational studies suggest that star formation is a hierarchical process, following the fractal nature of natal molecular clouds and allowing the formation of large-scale associations in-situ. We distinguish between these two scenarios by characterising the kinematics of OB associations using the Tycho-$Gaia$ Astrometric Solution catalogue. To this end, we quantify four key kinematic diagnostics: the number ratio of stars with positive radial velocities to those with negative radial velocities, the median radial velocity, the median radial velocity normalised by the tangential velocity, and the radial anisotropy parameter. Each quantity presents a useful diagnostic of whether the association was more compact in the past. We compare these diagnostics to models representing random motion and the expanding products of monolithic cluster formation. None of these diagnostics show evidence of expansion, either from a single cluster or multiple clusters, and the observed kinematics are better represented by a random velocity distribution. This result favours the hierarchical star formation model in which a minority of stars forms in bound clusters and large-scale, hierarchically-structured associations are formed in-situ.},

  title       = {A method to estimate stellar ages from kinematical data},
  abstract    = {We present a method to build a probability density function (pdf) for the age of a star based on its peculiar velocities $U$, $V$ and $W$ and its orbital eccentricity. The sample used in this work comes from the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey (GCS) which contains both the spatial velocities, orbital eccentricities and isochronal ages for about $14\,000$ stars. Using the GCS stars, we fitted the parameters that describe the relations between the distributions of kinematical properties and age. This parametrization allows us to obtain an age probability from the kinematical data. From this age pdf, we estimate an individual average age for the star using the most likely age and the expected age. We have obtained the stellar age pdf for the age of $9\,102$ stars from the GCS and have shown that the distribution of individual ages derived from our method is in good agreement with the distribution of isochronal ages. We also observe a decline in the mean metallicity with our ages for stars younger than 7 Gyr, similar to the one observed for isochronal ages. This method can be useful for the estimation of rough stellar ages for those stars that fall in areas of the HR diagram where isochrones are tightly crowded. As an example of this method, we estimate the age of Trappist-1, which is a M8V star, obtaining the age of $t(UVW) = 12.50(+0.29-6.23)$ Gyr.},

We report on a VLT/VIMOS spectroscopic follow-up program that, combined with past spectroscopy, allowed us to confirm four galaxy clusters (M200 ~ 10^14 Msol) and a dozen associated groups and star-forming galaxy overdensities. Two additional filamentary structures at z ~ 0.62 and z ~ 0.69 and foreground and background clusters at 0.6 < z < 0.7 were also confirmed along the line-of-sight. The structure subcomponents are at different formation stages. The clusters have a core dominated by passive galaxies and an established red sequence. The remaining structures are a mix of star-forming galaxy overdensities and forming groups. The presence of quiescent galaxies in the core of the latter shows that `preprocessing' has already happened before the groups fall into their more massive neighbours. Our spectroscopy allows us to derive spectral index measurements e.g. emission/absorption line equivalent widths, strength of the 4000A break, valuable to investigate the star formation history of structure members. Based on these line measurements, we select a population of `poststarburst' galaxies. These galaxies are preferentially found within the virial radius of clusters, supporting a scenario in which their recent quenching could be prompted by gas stripping by the dense intracluster medium. We derive stellar age estimates using MCMC-based spectral fitting for quiescent galaxies and find a correlation between ages and colours/stellar masses which favours a top-down formation scenario of the red sequence. A catalogue of ~650 redshifts in UDS will be released alongside the paper.},

  abstract    = {We use the semi-analytic model of galaxy formation SAG on the MultiDark simulation MDPL2 to study the relevance of mass quenching and environmental quenching on passive satellite galaxies. We find that environmental processes dominate the star formation (SF) quenching of low mass satellites ($M_{\star} \lesssim 1.3 \times 10^{10}\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$), while mass quenching gains relevance on more massive galaxies ($M_{\star} \gtrsim 3 \times 10^{10}\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$), consistent with previous results in the literature. For a given stellar mass, SF quenching is less efficient in galaxies accreted by lower mass haloes both before and after first infall, because of the lower efficiency of both environmental and mass quenching processes, in contradiction with analysis of observational data. Quenching time-scales estimated for satellites that are active at first infall support the delay-then-rapid quenching scenario. The environment dominates the period of delayed quenching acting on the hot gas, while mass quenching is responsible for the fast decline of SF as the cold gas is consumed. The former stage is characterized by delay time-scales that range from $\approx 4\,{\rm Gyr}$ to $\approx 0.5\,{\rm Gyr}$ for low ($M_{\star} \approx 10^{10}\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$) and high ($M_{\star} \approx 10^{11}\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$) mass satellites, respectively. SF fading time-scales have the opposite trend with stellar mass, being $\approx 0.5\, {\rm Gyr}$ for low mass satellites and $\approx 2 \, {\rm Gyr}$ for high mass ones.},

  abstract    = {We present results from the semi-analytic model of galaxy formation SAG applied on the MultiDark simulation MDPL2. SAG features an updated supernova (SN) feedback scheme and a robust modelling of the environmental effects on satellite galaxies. This incorporates a gradual starvation of the hot gas halo driven by the action of ram pressure stripping (RPS), that can affect the cold gas disc, and tidal stripping (TS), which can act on all baryonic components. Galaxy orbits of orphan satellites are integrated providing adequate positions and velocities for the estimation of RPS and TS. The star formation history and stellar mass assembly of galaxies are sensitive to the redshift dependence implemented in the SN feedback model. We discuss a variant of our model that allows to reconcile the predicted star formation rate density at $z \gtrsim 3$ with the observed one, at the expense of an excess in the faint end of the stellar mass function at $z=2$. The fractions of passive galaxies as a function of stellar mass, halo mass and the halo-centric distances are consistent with observational measurements. The model also reproduces the evolution of the main sequence of star forming central and satellite galaxies. The similarity between them is a result of the gradual starvation of the hot gas halo suffered by satellites, in which RPS plays a dominant role. RPS of the cold gas does not affect the fraction of quenched satellites but it contributes to reach the right atomic hydrogen gas content for more massive satellites ($M_{\star}\gtrsim 10^{10}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$).},

  title       = {Disc-Halo Interactions in ΛCDM},
  abstract    = {We present a new method for embedding a stellar disc in a cosmological dark matter halo and provide a worked example from a {\Lambda}CDM zoom-in simulation. The disc is inserted into the halo at a redshift z = 3 as a zero-mass rigid body. Its mass and size are then increased adiabatically while its position, velocity, and orientation are determined from rigid-body dynamics. At z = 1, the rigid disc is replaced by an N-body disc whose particles sample a three-integral distribution function (DF). The simulation then proceeds to z = 0 with live disc and halo particles. By comparison, other methods assume one or more of the following: the centre of the rigid disc during the growth phase is pinned to the minimum of the halo potential, the orientation of the rigid disc is fixed, or the live N-body disc is constructed from a two rather than three-integral DF. In general, the presence of a disc makes the halo rounder, more centrally concentrated, and smoother, especially in the innermost regions. We find that methods in which the disc is pinned to the minimum of the halo potential tend to overestimate the amount of adiabatic contraction. Additionally, the effect of the disc on the subhalo distribution appears to be rather insensitive to the disc insertion method. The live disc in our simulation develops a bar that is consistent with the bars seen in late-type spiral galaxies. In addition, particles from the disc are launched or "kicked up" to high galactic latitudes.},

  title       = {Formation of Globular Cluster Systems: From Dwarf Galaxies to Giants},
  abstract    = {Globular cluster (GC) systems around galaxies of a vast mass range show remarkably simple scaling relations. The combined mass of all GCs is a constant fraction of the total galaxy mass and the mean metallicity and metallicity dispersion of the GC system scale up weakly with galaxy mass. The metallicity of massive, metal-poor ("blue") clusters increases with cluster mass, while that of metal-rich ("red") clusters does not. A significant age-metallicity relation emerges from analysis of resolved stellar populations in Galactic GCs and unresolved populations in nearby galaxies. Remarkably, all these trends can be explained by a simple merger-based model developed in previous work and updated here using recent observations of galaxy scaling relations at high redshift. We show that the increasing dispersion of GC metallicity distributions with galaxy mass is a robust prediction of the model. It arises from more massive galaxies having more mergers that combine satellite GC systems. The average metallicity also increases by 0.6~dex over 3~dex in halo mass. The models show a non-linear trend between the GC system mass and host galaxy mass which is consistent with the data. The model does not consider GC self-enrichment, yet predicts a correlation between cluster mass and metallicity for massive blue clusters. The age-metallicity relation is another robust prediction of the model. Half of all clusters are predicted to form within the redshift range $5<z<2.3$, corresponding to ages of $10.8-12.5$~Gyr, in halos of masses $10^{11}-10^{12.5} M_{\odot}$.},

We find that efficient stellar feedback is a necessary ingredient in order to develop a realistic interstellar medium (ISM), leading to molecular cloud masses, sizes, velocity dispersions and virial parameters in excellent agreement with Milky Way observations. GMC scaling relations observed in the Milky Way, such as the mass-size ($M$--$R$), velocity dispersion-size ($\sigma$--$R$), and the $\sigma$--$R\Sigma$ relations, are reproduced in a feedback driven ISM when observed in projection, with $M\propto R^{2.3}$ and $\sigma\propto R^{0.56}$. When analysed in 3D, GMC scaling relations steepen significantly, indicating potential limitations of our understanding of molecular cloud 3D structure from observations. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a GMC population's underlying distribution of virial parameters can strongly influence the scatter in derived scaling relations. Finally, we show that GMCs with nearly identical global properties exist in different evolutionary stages, where a majority of clouds being either gravitationally bound or expanding, but with a significant fraction being compressed by external ISM pressure, at all times.},

The few z~10-11 candidates discovered to date have been exceptionally small- barely resolved, if at all, by the Hubble Space Telescope. Here we present the discovery of SPT0615-JD, a fortuitous z~10 (z_phot=9.9+/-0.6) galaxy candidate stretched into an arc over ~2.5" by the effects of strong gravitational lensing. Discovered in the Reionization Lensing Cluster Survey (RELICS) Hubble Treasury program and companion S-RELICS Spitzer program, this candidate has a lensed H-band magnitude of 25.7+/-0.1 AB mag. With a magnification of \mu~4-7 estimated from our lens models, the de-lensed intrinsic magnitude is 27.6+/-0.3 AB mag, and the half-light radius is r_e<0.8 kpc, both consistent with other z>9 candidates. The inferred stellar mass (log [M* /M_Sun]=9.7^{+0.7}_{-0.5}) and star formation rate (\log [SFR/M_Sun yr^{-1}]=1.3^{+0.2}_{-0.3}) indicate that this candidate is a typical star-forming galaxy on the z>6 SFR-M* relation. We note that three independent lens models predict two counterimages, at least one of which should be of a similar magnitude to the arc, but these counterimages are not yet detected. Counterimages would not be expected if the arc were at lower redshift. However, the only spectral energy distributions capable of fitting the Hubble and Spitzer photometry well at lower redshifts require unphysical combinations of z~2 galaxy properties. The unprecedented lensed size of this z~10 candidate offers the potential for the James Webb Space Telescope to study the geometric and kinematic properties of a galaxy observed 500 Myr after the Big Bang.},

In this context, we report the detection of a narrow-line emitter within the extended LyA nebula (~120kpc diameter) of the luminous radio-quiet quasi-stellar object (QSO) LBQS 0302-0019 at z=3.286. We identify several high-ionization narrow emission lines (HeII, CIV, CIII]) associated with this point-like source, which we name "Jil", that is only ~20kpc (2.9") away from the QSO in projection. Emission-line diagnostics confirm that the source is likely powered by photoionization of an obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN) three orders of magnitude fainter than the QSO. The system represents the tightest unobscured/obscured dual AGN currently known at z>3, highlighting the power of MUSE to detect these elusive systems.},

  title       = {The Star Formation Rate in the Gravoturbulent Interstellar Medium},
  abstract    = {We analytically determine the star formation rate (SFR) based on a piecewise power law and lognormal probability distribution function (PDF) of density in giant molecular clouds. This is in contrast to previous analytic SFR models that use purely lognormal density PDFs. Low density gas resides in the lognormal portion of the PDF. Gas becomes gravitationally unstable past a critical density ($\rho_{crit}$), and the PDF begins to forms a power law. As the collapse of the cloud proceeds, the transitional density ($\rho_t$) between the lognormal and power law portions of the PDF moves towards lower-density while the slope of the power law ($\alpha$) becomes increasingly shallow. The star formation rate per free-fall time is calculated via an integral over the lognormal from $\rho_{crit}$ to $\rho_t$ and an integral over the power law from $\rho_t$ to infinity. As $\alpha$ becomes shallower the SFR increases beyond the expected values calculated from a lognormal density PDF. We show that the star formation efficiency per free fall time in local molecular clouds increases with shallower PDF power law slopes, in agreement with our model. The approach presented here yields star formation rates in good agreement with both local GMCs and extragalactic observations. Our model can explain why star formation is spatially and temporally variable within a cloud and can accelerate and why the depletion times observed in local and extragalactic giant molecular clouds vary. Our model can explain both star-bursting and quiescent star-forming systems without the need to invoke extreme variations in the local interstellar environment.},

  abstract    = {To investigate star formation and assembly processes of massive galaxies, we present here a spatially-resolved stellar populations analysis of a sample of 45 elliptical galaxies (Es) selected from the CALIFA survey. We find rather flat age and [Mg/Fe] radial gradients, weakly dependent on the effective velocity dispersion of the galaxy within half-light radius. However, our analysis shows that metallicity gradients become steeper with increasing galaxy velocity dispersion. In addition, we have homogeneously compared the stellar populations gradients of our sample of Es to a sample of nearby relic galaxies, i.e., local remnants of the high-z population of red nuggets. This comparison indicates that, first, the cores of present-day massive galaxies were likely formed in gas-rich, rapid star formation events at high redshift (z>2). This led to radial metallicity variations steeper than observed in the local Universe, and positive [Mg/Fe] gradients. Second, our analysis also suggests that a later sequence of minor dry mergers, populating the outskirts of early-type galaxies (ETGs), flattened the pristine [Mg/Fe] and metallicity gradients. Finally, we find a tight age-[Mg/Fe] relation, supporting that the duration of the star formation is the main driver of the [Mg/Fe] enhancement in massive ETGs. However, the star formation time-scale alone is not able to fully explain our [Mg/Fe] measurements. Interestingly, our results match the expected effect that a variable stellar initial mass function would have on the [Mg/Fe] ratio.},

It studied 50 nearby star-forming galaxies in five bands from the near UV to the I-band, combining new Wide Field Camera 3 observations with archival Advanced Camera for Surveys data. LEGUS was designed to investigate how star formation occurs and develops on both small and large scales, and how it relates to the galactic environments. In this paper we present the photometric catalogs for all the apparently single stars identified in the 50 LEGUS galaxies. Photometric catalogs and mosaicked images for all filters are available for download. We present optical and near UV color-magnitude diagrams for all the galaxies. For each galaxy we derived the distance from the tip of the red giant branch. We then used the NUV color-magnitude diagrams to identify stars more massive than 14 Mo, and compared their number with the number of massive stars expected from the GALEX FUV luminosity. Our analysis shows that the fraction of massive stars forming in star clusters and stellar associations is about constant with the star formation rate. This lack of a relation suggests that the time scale for evaporation of unbound structures is comparable or longer than 10 Myr. At low star formation rates this translates to an excess of mass in clustered environments as compared to model predictions of cluster evolution, suggesting that a significant fraction of stars form in unbound systems.},

We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (ultraviolet) and SDSS photometry to a library of dust-attenuated population synthesis models. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare remarkably well with those from SDSS-measured emission lines (Hα). Deviations from perfect agreement are shown to be due to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to Hα measurements, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak Hα, and where Hα is contaminated with AGN emission (1/2 of the sample). Using full-SED SFRs, we calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX far- and near-UV magnitudes to produce dust-corrected SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGNs, (2) those hosting an AGN, and (3) galaxies without Hα emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGNs lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Star-forming galaxies without an AGN lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. On the other hand, weak AGNs, while also massive, have lower SFRs, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies via strong and weak AGNs. We confirm that some galaxies with no Hα show signs of star formation in the UV. We derive a cosmic star formation density at z = 0.1 with significantly smaller total error than previous measurements.},

After converting all observations to a common set of calibrations, we find a remarkable consensus among MS observations (~0.1 dex 1σ interpublication scatter). By fitting for time evolution of the MS in bins of constant mass, we deconvolve the observed scatter about the MS within each observed redshift bin. After accounting for observed scatter between different SFR indicators, we find the width of the MS distribution is ~0.2 dex and remains constant over cosmic time. Our best fits indicate the slope of the MS is likely time-dependent, with our best-fit log SFR( M * , t ) = (0.84 ± 0.02 – 0.026 ± 0.003 × t )log M * – (6.51 ± 0.24 – 0.11 ± 0.03 × t ), where t is the age of the universe in Gyr. We use our fits to create empirical evolutionary tracks in order to constrain MS galaxy star formation histories (SFHs), finding that (1) the most accurate representations of MS SFHs are given by delayed-τ models, (2) the decline in fractional stellar mass growth for a "typical" MS galaxy today is approximately linear for most of its lifetime, and (3) scatter about the MS can be generated by galaxies evolving along identical evolutionary tracks assuming an initial 1σ spread in formation times of ~1.4 Gyr.},

The remaining 28% comprises quiescent galaxies. Galaxies on the "normal" star formation sequence show strong trends of increasing dust attenuation with stellar mass and a decreasing specific SFR, with an observed scatter of 0.25 dex. The dusty, blue galaxies reside in the upper envelope of the star formation sequence with remarkably similar spectral shapes at all masses, suggesting that the same physical process is dominating the stellar light.

In this paper, we study the tight correlation between the star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass of galaxies at a given redshift, how halo growth influences star formation, and star formation histories of individual galaxies. We study these topics using Illustris, a state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of galaxy formation. Illustris reproduces the observed relation (the star formation main sequence, SFMS) between SFR and stellar mass at redshifts z = 0 and 4, but at intermediate redshifts of z {\sime} 1-2, the simulated SFMS has a significantly lower normalization than reported by observations. The scatter in the relation is consistent with the observed scatter. However, the fraction of outliers above the SFR-stellar mass relation in Illustris is less than that observed. Galaxies with halo masses of {\tilde}10$^{12}$ M$_{⊙}$ dominate the SFR density of the Universe, in agreement with the results of abundance matching. Furthermore, more-massive galaxies tend to form the bulk of their stars at high redshift, which indicates that `downsizing' occurs in Illustris. We also studied the star formation histories of individual galaxies, including the use of a principal component analysis decomposition. We find that for fixed stellar mass, galaxies that form earlier have more-massive black holes at z = 0, indicating that star formation and black hole growth are tightly linked processes in Illustris. While many of the properties of normal star-forming galaxies are well reproduced in the Illustris simulation, forming a realistic population of starbursts will likely require higher resolution and probably a more sophisticated treatment of star formation and feedback from stars and black holes.},

The main focus is on the SFRs from the far-IR (PACS-Herschel data) with those from the ultraviolet, for galaxies selected according to the BzK criterion. FIR-selected samples lead to a vastly different slope of the SFR-stellar mass (M$_{*}$) relation, compared to that of the dominant main-sequence population as measured from the UV, since the FIR selection picks predominantly only a minority of outliers. However, there is overall agreement between the main sequences derived with the two SFR indicators, when stacking on the PACS maps the BzK-selected galaxies. The resulting logarithmic slope of the SFR-M$_{*}$ relation is {\tilde}0.8-0.9, in agreement with that derived from the dust-corrected UV luminosity. Exploiting deeper 24 {$\mu$}m Spitzer data, we have characterized a subsample of galaxies with reddening and SFRs poorly constrained, as they are very faint in the B band. The combination of Herschel with Spitzer data has allowed us to largely break the age/reddening degeneracy for these intriguing sources, by distinguishing whether a galaxy is very red in B-z because of being heavily dust reddened, or whether because star formation has been (or is being) quenched. Finally, we have compared our SFR(UV) to the SFRs derived by stacking the radio data and to those derived from the H{$\alpha$} luminosity of a sample of star-forming galaxies at 1.4 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1.7. The two sets of SFRs are broadly consistent as they are with the SFRs derived from the UV and by stacking the corresponding PACS data in various mass bins.},

The Hα luminosity is attenuated by a factor of ~1.7 on average, and the maximum Hα attenuation is a factor of ~5.

Since the z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} 1 SFH data are quite precise, we investigate the sequence of assumptions and corrections that together affect the SFH normalization to test their accuracy, both in this redshift range and beyond. As lower limits on this normalization, we consider the evolution in stellar and metal mass densities, and supernova rate density, finding it unlikely that the SFH normalization is much lower than indicated by our direct fit. As a corresponding upper limit on the SFH normalization, we consider the Super-Kamiokande limit on the electron antineutrino ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/651/1/142/img1.gif] {img1.gif} e ) flux from past core-collapse supernovae, which applies primarily to z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} 1. We find consistency with the SFH only if the neutrino temperatures from supernova events are relatively modest. Constraints on the assumed initial mass function (IMF) also become apparent. The traditional Salpeter IMF, assumed for convenience by many authors, is known to be a poor representation at low stellar masses ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim}1 M ☉ ), and we show that recently favored IMFs are also constrained. In particular, somewhat shallow, or top-heavy, IMFs may be preferred, although they cannot be too top-heavy. To resolve the outstanding issues, improved data are called for on the supernova rate density evolution, the ranges of stellar masses leading to core-collapse and type Ia supernovae, and the antineutrino and neutrino backgrounds from core-collapse supernovae.},

  abstract = {Observations suggest that star formation occurs in only one or two crossing times for a range of scales spanning a factor of ~1000. These observations include (1) measurements of embedded cluster ages in comparison with the cloud core dynamical times, (2) measurements of the age difference versus separation for clusters in the Large Magellanic Clouds in comparison with the crossing time versus size correlation for molecular clouds, (3) the hierarchical structure of embedded young clusters, and (4) the high fraction of dense clouds that contain star formation. Such a short overall timescale for star formation implies that sources of turbulent energy or internal feedback are not required to explain or extend cloud lifetimes and that star and protostar interactions cannot be important for the stellar initial mass function. Stars appear in a cloud as if they freeze out of the gas, preserving the turbulent-driven gas structure in their birth locations. The Galaxy-wide star formation rate avoids the Zuckerman-Evans catastrophe, which has long been a concern for molecular clouds that evolve this quickly, because the multifractal structure of interstellar gas ensures that only a small fraction of the mass is able to form stars. Star formation on large scales operates more slowly than on small scales, but in most cases the whole process is over in only a few dynamical times.},

  abstract = {The main sequence (MS) of star-forming (SF) galaxies plays a fundamental role in driving galaxy evolution and our efforts to understand it. However, different studies find significant differences in the normalization, slope, and shape of the MS. These discrepancies arise mainly from the different selection criteria adopted to isolate SF galaxies, which may include or exclude galaxies with a specific star formation rate (SFR) substantially below the MS value. To obviate this limitation of all current criteria, we propose an objective definition of the MS that does not rely at all on a pre-selection of SF galaxies. Constructing the 3D SFR–mass–number plot, the MS is then defined as the ridge line of the SF peak, as illustrated with various figures. The advantages of such a definition are manifold. If generally adopted, it will facilitate the inter-comparison of results from different groups using the same SFR and stellar mass diagnostics, or it will highlight the relative systematics of different diagnostics. All of this could help to understand MS galaxies as systems in a quasi-steady state equilibrium and would also provide a more objective criterion for identifying quenching galaxies.},

Our main results can be summarized as follows: (i) the slope of the star-formation rate– M * correlation is consistent with being constant ≃0.8 up to z ≃ 1.5, while its normalization keeps increasing with redshift; (ii) for the first time we are able to explore the FIR–radio correlation for a mass-selected sample of star-forming galaxies: the correlation does not evolve up to z ≃ 4; (iii) we confirm that galaxy stellar mass is a robust proxy for UV dust attenuation in star-forming galaxies, with more massive galaxies being more dust attenuated. Strikingly, we find that this attenuation relation evolves very weakly with redshift, with the amount of dust attenuation increasing by less than 0.3 mag over the redshift range [0.5–4] for a fixed stellar mass; (iv) the correlation between dust attenuation and the UV spectral slope evolves with redshift, with the median UV slope becoming bluer with redshift. By z ≃ 3, typical UV slopes are inconsistent, given the measured dust attenuations, with the predictions of commonly used empirical laws. (v) Finally, building on existing results, we show that gas reddening is marginally larger (by a factor of around 1.3) than the stellar reddening at all redshifts probed. Our results support a scenario where the ISM conditions of typical star-forming galaxies evolve with redshift, such that at z ≥ 1.5 Main Sequence galaxies have ISM conditions moving closer to those of local starbursts.},

  abstract    = {The innermost regions in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) were not being spatially resolved so far but spectropolarimetry can provide us insight about their hidden physics and the geometry. From spectropolarimetric observations in broad emission lines and assuming equatorial scattering as a dominant polarization mechanism, it is possible to estimate the mass of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We explore the possibilities and limits and to put constraints on the usage of the method for determining SMBH masses using polarization in broad emission lines by providing more in-depth theoretical modeling. Methods. We use the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code STOKES for exploring polarization of Type 1 AGNs. We model equatorial scattering using flared-disk geometry for a set of different SMBH masses assuming Thomson scattering. In addition to the Keplerian motion in the BLR, we also consider cases of additional radial inflows and vertical outflows. We model the profiles of polarization plane position angle, degree of polarization and total unpolarized line for different BLR geometries and different SMBH masses. Our modeling confirms that the method can be widely used for Type-1 AGNs when viewing inclinations are between 25 and 45 degrees. We show that the distance between the BLR and scattering region (SR) has a significant impact on the mass estimates and the best mass estimates are when the SR is situated at the distance 1.5-2.5 times larger than the outer BLR radius. Our models show that if Keplerian motion can be traced through the polarized line profile, then the direct estimation of the mass of the SMBH can be performed. When radial inflows or vertical outflows are present in the BLR, this method can be applied if velocities of the inflow/outflow are less than 500 km/s. We find that models for NGC4051, NGC4151, 3C273 and PG0844+349 are in good agreements with observations.},

We consider how astrophysical processes are altered in the absence of weak forces, including Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), galaxy formation, molecular cloud assembly, star formation, and stellar evolution. Without weak interactions, neutrons no longer decay, and the universe emerges from its early epochs with a mixture of protons, neutrons, deuterium, and helium. The baryon-to-photon ratio must be smaller than the canonical value in our universe to allow free nucleons to survive the BBN epoch without being incorporated into heavier nuclei. At later times, the free neutrons readily combine with protons to make deuterium in sufficiently dense parts of the interstellar medium, and provide a power source before they are incorporated into stars. Almost all of the neutrons are incorporated into deuterium nuclei before stars are formed. As a result, stellar evolution proceeds primarily through strong interactions, with deuterium first burning into helium, and then helium fusing into carbon. Low-mass deuterium-burning stars can be long-lived, and higher mass stars can synthesize the heavier elements necessary for life. Although somewhat different from our own, such universes remain potentially habitable.},

  title       = {A Precise Distance to the Host Galaxy of the Binary Neutron Star Merger GW170817 Using Surface Brightness Fluctuations},
  abstract    = {The joint detection of gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation from the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 has provided unprecedented insight into a wide range of physical processes: heavy element synthesis via the $r$-process; the production of relativistic ejecta; the equation of state of neutron stars and the nature of the merger remnant; the binary coalescence timescale; and a measurement of the Hubble constant via the "standard siren" technique. In detail, all of these results depend on the distance to the host galaxy of the merger event, NGC4993. In this paper we measure the surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) distance to NGC4993 in the F110W and F160W passbands of the Wide Field Camera 3 Infrared Channel on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). For the preferred F110W passband we derive a distance modulus of $m{-}M=33.05\pm0.08\pm0.10$ mag, or a linear distance $d=40.7\pm1.4\pm1.9$ Mpc (random and systematic errors, respectively); a virtually identical result is obtained from the F160W data. This is the most precise distance to NGC4993 available to date. Combining our distance measurement with the corrected recession velocity of NGC4993 implies a Hubble constant $H_0=71.9\pm 7.1$ \kmsmpc. A comparison of our result to the GW-inferred value of $H_0$ indicates a binary orbital inclination of $i\,{\gtrsim}\,137~\deg$. The SBF technique can be applied to early-type host galaxies of BNS mergers to ${\sim\,}100$ Mpc with HST and possibly as far as ${\sim\,}300$ Mpc with the James Webb Space Telescope, thereby helping to break the inherent distance-inclination degeneracy of the GW signals at distances where many future BNS mergers are likely to be detected.},

  abstract    = {We present radial profiles of the surface mass density (SMD) in spiral galaxies directly calculated using rotation curves (RC) on two approximations of flat-disk (SMD-F) and spherical mass distribution (SMD-S). The SMDs are combined with surface brightness (SB) using photometric data to derive radial variations of the mass-to-luminosity ratio (ML). It is found that ML has generally a central peak or a plateau, and decreases to a local minimum at $R\sim 0.1-0.2 h$, where $R$ is the radius and $h$ is the scale radius of optical disk. The ML ratio, then, increases rapidly till $\sim 0.5h$, and is followed by gradual rise till $\sim 2h$, remaining at around ML$\sim 2$ in w1 band (infrared $\lambda$ 3.4 $\mu$m) and $\sim 10\ [L_\odot M_\odot^{-1}]$ in r-band ($\lambda$6200-7500 A). Beyond this radius, ML steeply increases toward the observed edges at $R\sim 5h$, attaining values as high as ML$\sim 20$ in w1 and $\sim 10^2\ [L_\odot M_\odot^{-1}]$ in r-band, indicative of dominant dark matter. The general properties of the ML distributions will be useful to constrain cosmological formation models of spiral galaxies.

  abstract    = {Filamentary structures are ubiquitous in high-mass star-forming molecular clouds. Their relation with high-mass star formation is still to be understood. Here we report interferometric observations toward 8 filamentary high-mass star-forming clouds. A total of 50 dense cores are identified in these clouds, most of which present signatures of high-mass star formation. Five of them are not associated with any star formation indicators, hence are prestellar core candidates. Evolutionary phases of these cores and their linewidths, temperatures, NH$_3$ abundances, and virial parameters are found to be correlated. In a sub-sample of 4 morphologically well-defined filaments, we find that their fragmentation can not be solely explained by thermal or turbulence pressure support. We also investigate distributions of gas temperatures and non-thermal motions along the filaments, and find a spatial correlation between non-thermal linewidths and star formation activities. We find evidence of gas flows along these filaments, and derive an accretion rate along filaments of $\sim$10$^{-4}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. These results suggest a strong relationship between massive filaments and high-mass star formation, through i) filamentary fragmentation in very early evolutionary phases to form dense cores, ii) accretion flows along filaments that are important for the growth of dense cores and protostars, and iii) enhancement of non-thermal motion in the filaments by the feedback or accretion during star formation.},

These are rooted in rather ad hoc and fine-tuned initial conditions, such as the simultaneous requirements of extremely low metallicities and strong radiation backgrounds. Here we explore a modification of such scenarios where a massive primordial star cluster is initially produced. Subsequent stellar collisions give rise to the formation of massive (10^4 - 10^5 solar mass) objects. Our calculations demonstrate that the interplay between stellar dynamics, gas accretion and protostellar evolution is particularly relevant. Gas accretion onto the protostars enhances their radii, resulting in an enhanced collisional cross section. We show that the fraction of collisions can increase from 0.1-1% of the initial population to about 10% when compared to gas-free models or models of protostellar clusters in the local Universe. We conclude that very massive objects can form in spite of initial fragmentation, making the first massive protostellar clusters viable candidate birth places for observed supermassive black holes.},

Resolved colour-magnitude diagrams of Milky Way GCs and direct imaging of lensed proto-GCs at z $\sim$ 6 with JWST promise further insight. Globular clusters are known to host multiple populations of stars with variations in their chemical abundances. Recently, such multiple populations have been detected in $\sim$2 Gyr old compact, massive star clusters. This suggests a common, single pathway for the formation of GCs at high and low redshift. The shape of the initial mass function for GCs remains unknown, however for massive galaxies a power-law mass function is favoured. Significant progress has been made recently modelling GC formation in the context of galaxy formation, with success in reproducing many of the observed GC-galaxy scaling relations.},

  abstract    = {Star-forming galaxies display a close relation among stellar mass, metallicity and star-formation rate (or molecular-gas mass). This is known as the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) (or molecular-gas FMR), and it has a profound implication on models of galaxy evolution. However, there still remains a significant residual scatter around the FMR. We show here that a fourth parameter, the surface density of stellar mass, reduces the dispersion around the molecular-gas FMR. In a principal component analysis of 29 physical parameters of 41,338 star-forming galaxies, the surface density of stellar mass is found to be the fourth most important parameter. The new four-dimensional fundamental relation forms a tighter hypersurface that reduces the metallicity dispersion to 50\% of that of the molecular-gas FMR. We suggest that future analyses and models of galaxy evolution should consider the FMR in a four-dimensional space that includes surface density. The dilution time scale of gas inflow and the star-formation efficiency could explain the observational dependence on surface density of stellar mass.},

Given the apparent absence of low-redshift counterparts, this has often been interpreted as indicating that the high-density, compact red galaxies must be `puffed up' by some mechanism. We compare the ensemble of high-redshift observations with large samples of well-observed, low-redshift ellipticals. At the same physical radii, the stellar surface mass densities of low- and high-redshift systems are comparable. Moreover, the abundance of high surface density material at low redshift is comparable to or larger than that observed at z $\gt$ 1-2, consistent with the continuous buildup of spheroids over this time. The entire population of compact, high-redshift red galaxies may be the progenitors of the high-density cores of present-day ellipticals, with no need for a decrease in stellar density from z = 2 to 0. The primary difference between low- and high-redshift systems is thus the observed low-density material at large radii in low-redshift spheroids (rather than the high-density material in high-redshift spheroids). Such low-density material may either (1) assemble at z $\lt$ 2 or (2) be present, but not yet detected, at z $\gt$ 2. Mock observations of low-redshift massive systems suggest that the amount of low-density material at high redshifts is indeed significantly less than that at z = 0. However, deeper observations will be important in constraining the exact amount (or lack thereof) and distribution of this material, and how it builds up with redshift. We show that, without deep observations, the full extent of such material even at low redshifts can be difficult to determine, in particular if the mass profile is not exactly a single Sersic profile. We discuss the implications of our results for physical models of galaxy evolution.},

Our surface brightness profiles expand over 12 mag in range allowing us to explore the presence of any faint extended envelope on these objects down to stellar mass densities ~10 6 M ☉  kpc –2 at radial distances of ~15 kpc. We find no evidence for any extended faint tail altering the compactness of these galaxies. Our objects are elongated, visually resembling S0 galaxies, and have a central stellar mass density well above the stellar mass densities of objects with similar stellar mass but normal size in the present universe. If these massive compact objects will eventually transform into normal size galaxies, the processes driving this size growth will have to migrate around (2-3) × 10 10 M ☉ stellar mass from their inner ( R < 1.7 kpc) region toward their outskirts. Nearby massive compact galaxies share with high- z compact massive galaxies not only their stellar mass, size, and velocity dispersion but also the shape of their profiles and the mean age of their stellar populations. This makes these singular galaxies unique laboratories to explore the early stages of the formation of massive galaxies.},

The galaxies are selected from the NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey in the Cosmic Evolution Survey field. We find a large population of massive young recently quenched ("post-starburst") galaxies at z > 1 that are almost non-existent at z < 1; their number density is 5 × 10 –5 Mpc –3 at z = 2, whereas it is a factor of 10 less at z = 0.5. The observed number densities of young and old quiescent galaxies at z > 1 are consistent with a simple model in which all old quiescent galaxies were once identified as post-starburst galaxies. We find that the overall population of quiescent galaxies have smaller sizes and slightly more elongated shapes at higher redshift, in agreement with other recent studies. Interestingly, the most recently quenched galaxies at 1 < z < 2 are not larger, and possibly even smaller, than older galaxies at those redshifts. This result is inconsistent with the idea that the evolution of the average size of quiescent galaxies is largely driven by continuous transformations of larger, star-forming galaxies: in that case, the youngest quiescent galaxies would also be the largest. Instead, mergers or other mechanisms appear to be required to explain the size growth of quiescent galaxies from z = 2 to the present.},

Our findings demonstrate that fully assembled early-type galaxies make up at most ~10% of the population of K -selected quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2.3, effectively ruling out simple monolithic models for their formation. The galaxies must evolve significantly after z ~ 2.3, through dry mergers or other processes, consistent with predictions from hierarchical models.},

The evolution is governed by the interplay between smooth and clumpy cold streams, disk instability, and bulge formation. Intense, relatively smooth streams maintain an unstable dense gas-rich disk. Instability with high turbulence and giant clumps, each a few percent of the disk mass, is self-regulated by gravitational interactions within the disk. The clumps migrate into a bulge in ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 10 dynamical times, or ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 0.5 Gyr. The cosmological streams replenish the draining disk and prolong the clumpy phase to several Gigayears in a steady state , with comparable masses in disk, bulge, and dark matter within the disk radius. The clumps form stars in dense subclumps following the overall accretion rate, ~100 M ☉ yr –1 , and each clump converts into stars in ~0.5 Gyr. While the clumps coalesce dissipatively to a compact bulge, the star-forming disk is extended because the incoming streams keep the outer disk dense and susceptible to instability and because of angular momentum transport. Passive spheroid-dominated galaxies form when the streams are more clumpy: the external clumps merge into a massive bulge and stir up disk turbulence that stabilize the disk and suppress in situ clump and star formation. We predict a bimodality in galaxy type by z ~ 3, involving giant-clump star-forming disks and spheroid-dominated galaxies of suppressed star formation. After z ~ 1, the disks tend to be stabilized by the dominant stellar disks and bulges. Most of the high- z massive disks are likely to end up as today's early-type galaxies.},

About half of the galaxies are very compact (effective radii r e < 1 kpc) at rest-frame optical wavelengths; the others are extended (1 kpc < r e < 10 kpc). For reference, 1 kpc corresponds to 0.12'' at z = 2.5 in the adopted cosmology. We separate actively star-forming galaxies from quiescent galaxies by modeling their rest-frame UV-NIR SEDs. The star-forming galaxies span the full range of sizes, while the quiescent galaxies all have r e < 2 kpc. In the redshift range where MIPS 24 μm imaging is a sensitive probe of reradiated dust emission ( z < 2.5), the 24 μm fluxes confirm that the light of the small quiescent galaxies is dominated by old stars, rather than dust-enshrouded star formation or AGN activity. The inferred surface mass densities and velocity dispersions for the quiescent galaxies are very high compared to those in local galaxies. The galaxies follow a Kormendy relation (between surface brightness and size) with approximately the same slope as locally, but shifted to brighter surface brightnesses, consistent with a mean stellar formation redshift of z f ~ 5. This paper demonstrates a direct relation between star formation activity and size at z ~ 2.5 and the existence of a significant population of massive, extremely dense, old stellar systems without readily identifiable counterparts in the local universe.},

The emission-line galaxies are classified by the nature of their ionized emission; there are six star-forming galaxies and four galaxies hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The star-forming galaxies are the largest among the emission-line galaxies, with a median size of r e = 2.8 kpc. The three galaxies with the highest star formation rates ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 100 M ☉ yr –1 ) have irregular and clumpy morphologies. The AGN host galaxies are more similar to the compact quiescent galaxies in terms of their structures ( r e ~ 1.1 kpc) and spectral energy distributions. The total sample clearly separates into two classes in a color-mass diagram: the large star-forming galaxies that form the blue cloud, and the compact quiescent galaxies on the red sequence. However, it is unclear how or even if the two classes are evolutionary related. Three out of six massive star-forming galaxies have dense cores and thus may passively evolve into compact galaxies due to fading of outer star-forming regions. For these galaxies, a reverse scenario in which compact galaxies grow inside-out by star formation is also plausible. We do caution though that the sample is small. Nonetheless, it is evident that a Hubble sequence of massive galaxies with strongly correlated galaxy properties is already in place at z > 2.},

We obtained near-infrared spectra with a wavelength coverage of 1.0-2.5 μm for 26 K -bright galaxies ( K < 19.7) selected from the Multi-wavelength Survey by Yale-Chile (MUSYC) using photometric redshifts. We successfully derived spectroscopic redshifts for all 26 galaxies using rest-frame optical emission lines or the redshifted Balmer/4000 Å break. Twenty galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts in the range 2.0 < z < 2.7, for which bright emission lines like Hα and [O III ] fall in atmospheric windows. Surprisingly, we detected no emission lines for nine of these 20 galaxies. The median 2 σ upper limit on the rest-frame equivalent width of Hα for these nine galaxies is ~10 Å. The stellar continuum emission of these same nine galaxies is best fitted by evolved stellar population models. The best-fit star formation rate (SFR) is zero for five out of nine galaxies and is consistent with zero within 1 σ for the remaining four. Thus, both the Hα measurements and the independent stellar continuum modeling imply that 45% of our K -selected galaxies are not forming stars intensely. This high fraction of galaxies without detected line emission and low SFRs may imply that the suppression of star formation in massive galaxies occurs at higher redshift than is predicted by current cold dark matter (CDM) galaxy formation models. However, obscured star formation may have been missed, and deep mid-infrared imaging is needed to clarify this situation.},

Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; Data Release 7), we have conducted a search for local red sequence galaxies with sizes and masses comparable to those found at z ~ 2.3. The SDSS spectroscopic target selection algorithm excludes high surface brightness objects; we show that this makes incompleteness a concern for such massive, compact galaxies, particularly for low redshifts ( z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 0.05).

Consistent with expectations from the virial theorem, the median offset from the mass-velocity dispersion relation for these galaxies is 0.12 dex. We do not, however, find any galaxies with sizes and masses comparable to those observed at z ~ 2.3, implying a decrease in the comoving number density of these galaxies, at fixed size and mass, by a factor of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 5000.

In order to confirm that the absence of such compact massive galaxies in SDSS is not produced by spectroscopic selection effects, we have also looked for such galaxies in the basic SDSS photometric catalog, using photometric redshifts. While we do find signs of a slight bias against massive, compact galaxies, this analysis suggests that the SDSS spectroscopic sample is missing at most a few objects in the regime we consider. Accepting the high-redshift results, it is clear that massive galaxies must undergo significant structural evolution over z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 2 in order to match the population seen in the local universe.

We combine Advanced Camera for Surveys and Wide Field Camera 3 Hubble Space Telescope images to study the morphology of our galaxies in their optical rest frame in the entire 0 < z < 2.5 range. We find that throughout the explored redshift range the passive galaxies selected with our criteria have weak morphological K -correction, with size being slightly smaller in the optical than in the UV rest frame (by ~20% and ~10% at z > 1.2 and z < 1.2, respectively). We measure a significant evolution of the mass-size relation of ETGs, with a fractional increment that is almost independent of the stellar mass. ETGs formed at z > 1 appear to be preferentially small, and the evolution of the mass-size relation at z < 1 is driven by both the continuous size growth of the compact galaxies and the appearance of new ETGs with large sizes. We also find that the number density of all passive ETGs increases rapidly, by a factor of five, from z ~ 2 to z ~ 1, and then more mildly by another factor of 1.5 from z ~ 1 to z ~ 0. We interpret these results as evidence that the bulk of the ETGs are formed at 1 < z < 3 through a mechanism that leaves very compact remnants. At z < 1 the compact ETGs grow gradually in size, becoming normal-size galaxies, and at the same time new ETGs with normal-large sizes are formed.},

This paper explores the first case of a nearby galaxy, NGC 1277 (at a distance of 73 Mpc in the Perseus galaxy cluster), which fulfills many criteria to be considered a relic galaxy. Using deep optical spectroscopy, we derive the star formation history along the structure of the galaxy: the stellar populations are uniformly old (>10 Gyr) with no evidence for more recent star formation episodes. The metallicity of their stars is super-solar ([Fe/H] = 0.20 ± 0.04 with a smooth decline toward the outer regions) and α-enriched ([α/Fe] = 0.4 ± 0.1). This suggests a very short formation time scale for the bulk of the stars in this galaxy. This object also rotates very fast ( V rot ~ 300 km s –1 ) and has a large central velocity dispersion (σ > 300 km s –1 ). NGC 1277 allows the exploration in full detail of properties such as the structure, internal dynamics, metallicity, and initial mass function as they were at ~10-12 Gyr ago when the first massive galaxies were built.},

Rest frame [O II ] λ3727 equivalent widths range from 5 to 94 Å, yielding star formation rates (SFRs) of ~0.1 to 14 M ☉ yr -1 . The analysis of various line diagnostic diagrams reveals that ~60% of compact emission-line galaxies have velocity widths, excitations, Hβ luminosities, SFRs, and mass-to-light ratios characteristic of young star-forming H II galaxies. The remaining 40% form a more heterogeneous class of evolved starbursts, similar to local starburst disk galaxies. We find that, although the compact galaxies at z > 0.7 have similar SFRs per unit mass to those at z < 0.7, they are on average ~10 times more massive . Our sample implies a lower limit for the global comoving SFR density of ~0.004 M ☉ yr -1 Mpc -3 at z = 0.55, and ~0.008 M ☉ yr -1 Mpc -3 at z = 0.85 (assuming Salpeter IMF, H 0 = 50 km s -1 Mpc -1 , and q 0 = 0.5). These values, when compared to estimates for a sample of local compact galaxies selected in a similar fashion, support a history of the universe in which the SFR density declines by a factor ~10 from z = 1 to today. From the comparison with the SFR densities derived for magnitude-limited samples of field galaxies, we conclude that compact emission-line galaxies, though only ~20% of the general field population, may contribute as much as ~45% to the global SFR of the universe at 0.4 < z < 1.},

One object is an active galactic nucleus, and two are at high redshift ( z > 2). The Keck redshift and photometric data are combined with Hubble Space Telescope images to derive luminosities and physical sizes. We also use emission-line widths, where available, to estimate masses. About two-thirds of the emission-line galaxies, or roughly one-half the sample, are small, low-mass, relatively luminous systems with properties resembling those of local H II galaxies. We compare the properties and numbers of these galaxies to the "bursting dwarf" model of Babul & Ferguson.

The number of galaxies fitting the model parameters are lower by a factor of 2-3 than predicted. An examination of samples used in analyses of disk surface brightness at redshifts z > 0.5 shows that compact galaxies are likely to contribute to the strong disk luminosity evolution found in some studies. Estimates of comoving volume densities indicate that the population of apparent H II galaxies evolves rapidly from redshifts of z ~ 1 to the present. It appears that not all of these galaxies can be progenitors of present-day spheroidal galaxies, although the numbers of them with sizes and masses comparable to spheroidals is not dissimilar to estimates of the local field spheroidal density. We also present 51 additional redshifts, acquired for other projects during the same observing period, for a total of 105 objects with identified redshifts z < 2 in the Hubble Deep Field and its flanking fields.},

  abstract = {We present an analysis of galaxies in the CDF-South. We find a tight relation to z = 3 between color and size at a given mass, with red galaxies being small, and blue galaxies being large. We show that the relation is driven by stellar surface density or inferred velocity dispersion: galaxies with high surface density are red and have low specific star formation rates, and galaxies with low surface density are blue and have high specific star formation rates. Surface density and inferred velocity dispersion are better correlated with specific star formation rate and color than stellar mass. Hence stellar mass by itself is not a good predictor of the star formation history of galaxies. In general, galaxies at a given surface density have higher specific star formation rates at higher redshift. Specifically, galaxies with a surface density of (1–3) × 10 9 M ☉ kpc −2 are "red and dead" at low redshift, approximately 50% are forming stars at z = 1, and almost all are forming stars by z = 2. This provides direct additional evidence for the late evolution of galaxies onto the red sequence. The sizes of galaxies at a given mass evolve like 1/(1 + z ) 0.59 ± 0.10 . Hence galaxies undergo significant upsizing in their history. The size evolution is fastest for the highest mass galaxies and quiescent galaxies. The persistence of the structural relations from z = 0 to z = 2.5, and the upsizing of galaxies imply that a relation analogous to the Hubble sequence exists out to z = 2.5, and possibly beyond. The star-forming galaxies at z ≥ 1.5 are quite different from star-forming galaxies at z = 0, as they have likely very high gas fractions, and star formation timescales comparable to the orbital time.},

The simulations are made intentionally simple, and include photoionization, cooling of the intergalactic medium, and star formation, but not feedback from AGNs or supernovae. All of the galaxies undergo an initial burst of star formation at z ≈ 5, accompanied by the formation of a bubble of heated gas. Two out of three galaxies show early-type properties at present, whereas only one of them experienced a major merger. Heating from shocks and PdV work dominates over cooling so that for most of the gas the temperature is an increasing function of time. By z ≈ 1 a significant fraction of the final stellar system is in place and the spectral energy distribution resembles those of observed massive red galaxies. The galaxies have grown from z = 1 → 0 on average by 25% in mass and in size by gas-poor (dry) stellar mergers. By the present day the simulated galaxies are old (≈10 Gyr), kinematically hot stellar systems surrounded by hot gaseous haloes. Stars dominate the mass of the galaxies up to ≈4 effective radii (≈10 kpc). Kinematic and most photometric properties are in good agreement with those of observed elliptical galaxies. The galaxy with a major merger develops a counter-rotating core. Our simulations show that realistic intermediate-mass giant elliptical galaxies with plausible formation histories can be formed from ΛCDM initial conditions even without requiring recent major mergers or feedback from supernovae or AGNs.},

The observed UV-to-8 μm spectral energy distributions are fitted with stellar population models to constrain star formation histories and derive stellar masses. We find that 70% of the DRGs are best described by dust-reddened star-forming models and 30% are very well fitted with old and "dead" models. Using only the I - K s and K s -4.5 μm colors, we can effectively separate the two groups.

To a limit of 0.5 × 10 11 M ☉ , their number density is ~10 times lower than that of local early-type galaxies. Furthermore, we use the IRAC photometry to derive rest-frame near-infrared J , H , and K fluxes. The DRGs and LBGs together show a large variation (a factor of 6) in the rest-frame K -band mass-to-light ratios ( M / L K ), implying that even a Spitzer 8 μm-selected sample would be very different from a mass-selected sample. The average M / L K of the DRGs is about 3 times higher than that of the LBGs, and DRGs dominate the high-mass end. The M / L K values and ages of the two samples appear to correlate with derived stellar mass, with the most massive galaxies being the oldest and having the highest mass-to-light ratios, similar to what is found in the low-redshift universe.},

Our rest-frame R -band images show that most of these objects have compact regular morphologies which follow the classical R 1/4 law.

Around one-third (3/10) of the massive red objects in the GDDS sample are extraordinarily compact, with effective radii under 1 kpc. Our NICMOS observations allow the detection of such systems more robustly than is possible with optical (rest-frame UV) data, and while similar systems have been seen at z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 2, this is the first time such systems have been detected in a rest-frame optical survey at 1.2 < z < 2. We refer to these compact galaxies as "red nuggets," and note that similarly compact massive galaxies are completely absent in the nearby universe. We introduce a new "stellar mass Kormendy relation" (stellar mass density versus size) which we use to single out the effects of size evolution from those of luminosity and color evolution in stellar populations. The 1 < z < 2 passive galaxies have mass densities that are an order of magnitude larger then early-type galaxies today and are comparable to the compact distant red galaxies at 2 < z < 3. We briefly consider mechanisms for size evolution in contemporary models focusing on equal-mass mergers and adiabatic expansion driven by stellar mass loss. Neither of these mechanisms appears to be able to transform the high-redshift Kormendy relation into its local counterpart, leaving the origin and fate of these compact "red nuggets" unresolved.},

We combine our results with those from GEMS at 0.2 < z < 1 and SDSS at z ~ 0.1 to achieve a comprehensive picture of the optical rest-frame size evolution from z = 0 to 3. Galaxies are differentiated according to their light concentration using the Sérsic index n . For less concentrated objects, the galaxies at a given luminosity were typically ~3 ± 0.5 (±2 σ) times smaller at z ~ 2.5 than those we see today. The stellar mass-size relation has evolved less: the mean size at a given stellar mass was ~2 ± 0.5 times smaller at z ~ 2.5, evolving proportionally to (1 + z ) -0.40±0.06 . Simple scaling relations between dark matter halos and baryons in a hierarchical cosmogony predict a stronger (although consistent within the error bars) than observed evolution of the stellar mass-size relation. The observed luminosity-size evolution out to z ~ 2.5 matches well recent infall model predictions for Milky Way-type objects. For low- n galaxies, the evolution of the stellar mass-size relation would follow naturally if the individual galaxies grow inside out. For highly concentrated objects, the situation is as follows: at a given luminosity, these galaxies were ~2.7 ± 1.1 times smaller at z ~ 2.5 (or, put differently, were typically ~2.2 ± 0.7 mag brighter at a given size than they are today), and at a given stellar mass the size has evolved proportionally to (1 + z ) -0.45±0.10 .},

We show that the stellar mass of galaxies at this number density has increased by a factor of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 2 since z = 2, following the relation log M n ( z ) = 11.45 – 0.15 z . In order to determine at what physical radii this mass growth occurred, we construct very deep stacked rest-frame R -band images of galaxies with masses near M n ( z ), at redshifts ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lang.gif] {lang} z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rang.gif] {rang} = 0.6, 1.1, 1.6, and 2.0. These image stacks of typically 70-80 galaxies enable us to characterize the stellar distribution to surface brightness limits of ~28.5 mag arcsec –2 . We find that massive galaxies gradually built up their outer regions over the past 10 Gyr. The mass within a radius of r = 5 kpc is nearly constant with redshift, whereas the mass at 5 kpc < r < 75 kpc has increased by a factor of ~4 since z = 2. Parameterizing the surface brightness profiles, we find that the effective radius and Sersic n parameter evolve as r e ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} (1 + z ) –1.3 and n ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} (1 + z ) –1.0 , respectively. The data demonstrate that massive galaxies have grown mostly inside-out, assembling their extended stellar halos around compact, dense cores with possibly exponential radial density distributions. Comparing the observed mass evolution to the average star formation rates of the galaxies we find that the growth is likely dominated by mergers, as in situ star formation can only account for ~20% of the mass buildup from z = 2 to z = 0. A direct consequence of these results is that massive galaxies do not evolve in a self-similar way: their structural profiles change as a function of redshift, complicating analyses which (often implicitly) assume self-similarity. The main uncertainties in this study are possible redshift-dependent systematic errors in the total stellar masses and the conversion from light-weighted to mass-weighted radial profiles.},

To investigate this claim, we have compared the ellipticity distribution of 31 carefully selected high-redshift massive quiescent compact galaxies to a set of mass-selected ellipticity and Sérsic index distributions obtained from two-dimensional structural fits to ~40, 000 nearby galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test shows that the distribution of ellipticities for the high-redshift galaxies is consistent with the ellipticity distribution of a similarly chosen sample of massive early-type galaxies. However, the distribution of Sérsic indices for the high-redshift sample is inconsistent with that of local early-type galaxies, and instead resembles that of local disk-dominated populations. The mismatch between the properties of high-redshift compact galaxies and those of both local early-type and disk-dominated systems leads us to conclude that the basic structures of high-redshift compact galaxies probably do not closely resemble those of any single local galaxy population. Any galaxy population analog to the high-redshift compact galaxies that exists at the current epoch is either a mix of different types of galaxies, or possibly a unique class of objects on their own.},

The radial trends of D4000, W 0 (Hδ), and W 0 (O ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/527/1/54/img1.gif] {img1.gif} ) are all consistent with an age sequence, in the sense that the last episode of star formation occurred more recently in galaxies farthest from the cluster center. Throughout the cluster environment, galaxies show evidence for older stellar populations than field galaxies; they have weaker W 0 (O ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/527/1/54/img1.gif] {img1.gif} ) and W 0 (Hδ) lines and stronger D4000 indexes. From our primary sample of 1413 galaxies, statistically corrected for incompleteness and selection effects, we identify a sample of K+A galaxies, which have strong Hδ absorption lines [ W 0 (Hδ) > 5 Å] but no [O II ] emission [ W 0 (O ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/527/1/54/img1.gif] {img1.gif} ) < 5 Å], perhaps indicative of recently terminated star formation. The observed fraction of 4.4% ± 0.7% in the cluster sample is an overestimate due to a systematic effect that results from the large uncertainties on individual spectral index measurements. Corrected for this bias, we estimate that K+A galaxies make up only 2.1% ± 0.7% of the cluster sample and 0.1% ± 0.7% of the field. From the subsample of galaxies more luminous than M r = -18.8 + 5 log h , which is statistically representative of a complete sample to this limit, the corrected fraction of K+A galaxies is 1.5% ± 0.8% in the cluster and 1.2% ± 0.8% in the field. Compared with the z ≈ 0.1 fraction of 0.30%, the fraction of K+A galaxies in the CNOC1 field sample is greater by perhaps a factor of 4, but with only 1 σ significance; no further evolution of this fraction is detectable over our redshift range. We compare our data with the results of PEGASE and GISSEL96 spectrophotometric models and conclude, from the relative fractions of red and blue galaxies with no [O II ] λ3727 emission and strong Hδ absorption, that up to 1.9% ± 0.8% of the cluster population may have had its star formation recently truncated without a starburst. However, this is still not significantly greater than the fraction of such galaxies in the field, 3.1% ± 1.0%. Furthermore, we do not detect an excess of cluster galaxies that have unambiguously undergone starbursts within the last 1 Gyr. In fact, at 6.3% ± 2.1%, the A+em galaxies that Poggianti et al. have recently suggested are dusty starbursts are twice as common in the field as in the cluster environment. Our results imply that these cluster environments are not responsible for inducing starbursts; thus, the increase in cluster blue galaxy fraction with redshift may not be a strictly cluster-specific phenomenon. We suggest that the truncation of star formation in clusters may largely be a gradual process, perhaps due to the exhaustion of gas in the galactic disks over fairly long timescales; in this case differential evolution may result because field galaxies can refuel their disks with gas from extended halos, thus regenerating star formation, while cluster galaxies may not have such halos and so continue to evolve passively.},

These distant red galaxies (DRGs) are efficiently selected by the simple observed color criterion J s - K s > 2.3. In this paper we present near-infrared spectroscopy with Keck NIRSPEC of six DRGs with previously measured redshifts 2.4 < z < 3.2, two of which were known to host an active nucleus. We detect continuum emission and emission lines of all observed galaxies. Equivalent widths of Hα in the nonactive galaxies are 20-30 Å, smaller than measured for Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and nearby luminous infrared galaxies and comparable to normal nearby galaxies. The modest equivalent widths imply that the galaxies either have a decreasing star formation rate or are very dusty. Fitting both the photometry and the Hα lines, we find continuum extinction A V = 1-2 mag, ages 1-2.5 Gyr, star formation rates 200-400 M ☉ yr -1 , and stellar masses (1-5) × 10 11 M ☉ for models with constant star formation rates. Models with a declining star formation lead to significantly lower extinction, star formation rates, and ages but similar stellar masses. From [N II ]/Hα ratios we infer that the metallicities are high, 1-1.5 times solar. For four galaxies we can determine line widths from the optical emission lines. The widths are high, ranging from 130 to 240 km s -1 , and by combining data for LBGs and DRGs, we find significant correlations between line width and rest-frame U - V color and between line width and stellar mass. The latter correlation has a similar slope and offset as the "baryonic Tully-Fisher relation" for nearby galaxies. From the line widths and effective radii we infer dynamical masses and mass-to-light ( M / L ) ratios. The median dynamical mass is ~2 × 10 11 M ☉ , supporting the high stellar masses inferred from the photometry. We find that the median M / L V ≈ 0.8( M / L ) ☉ , a factor of ~5 higher than measured for LBGs. We infer from our small sample that DRGs are dustier, more metal-rich, and more massive and have higher ages than z ≈ 3 LBGs of the same rest-frame V -band luminosity. Although their volume density is still uncertain, their high M / L ratios imply that they contribute significantly to the stellar mass density at z ≈ 2.5. As their stellar masses are comparable to those of early-type galaxies, they may have already assembled most of their final mass.},

Several mechanisms, including minor mergers, have been proposed for increasing galaxy sizes from high- to low- z . We search for superdense massive galaxies in the WIde-field Nearby Galaxy-cluster Survey (WINGS) of X-ray selected galaxy clusters at 0.04 < z < 0.07. We discover a significant population of superdense massive galaxies with masses and sizes comparable to those observed at high redshift.

We calculate a number density of 2.9 × 10 –2 Mpc –3 for superdense galaxies in local clusters, and a hard lower limit of 1.3 × 10 –5 Mpc –3 in the whole comoving volume between z = 0.04 and z = 0.07. We find a relation between mass, effective radius, and luminosity-weighted age in our cluster galaxies, which can mimic the claimed evolution of the radius with redshift, if not properly taken into account. We compare our data with spectroscopic high- z surveys and find that—when stellar masses are considered—there is consistency with the local WINGS galaxy sizes out to z ~ 2, while a discrepancy of a factor of 3 exists with the only spectroscopic z > 2 study. In contrast, there is strong evidence for a large evolution in radius for the most massive galaxies with M * > 4 × 10 11 M ☉ compared to similarly massive galaxies in WINGS, i.e., the brightest cluster galaxies.},

Surface brightness profiles from UDF images reach fainter than rest-frame 26.5 B mag arcsec -2 even for compact objects at z ~ 1.

Scale lengths of the extended components are mostly ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} 2 kpc, more than 1.5-2 times smaller than those of nearby large disk galaxies like the Milky Way. Larger, very low surface brightness disks can be excluded down to faint rest-frame surface brightnesses ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {gtrsim} 26 B mag arcsec -2 ). However, one or two of the LCBGs are large, disklike galaxies that meet LCBG selection criteria because of a bright central nucleus, possibly a forming bulge. These results indicate that ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {gtrsim} 90% of high- z LCBGs are small galaxies that will evolve into small disk galaxies, or low-mass spheroidal or irregular galaxies in the local universe, assuming passive evolution and no significant disk growth. The data do not reveal signs of disk formation around small, H II galaxy-like LCBGs, nor do they suggest a simple inside-out growth scenario for larger LCBGs with a disklike morphology. Irregular blue emission in distant LCBGs is relatively extended, suggesting that nebular emission lines from star-forming regions sample a major fraction of an LCBG's velocity field.},

For z ~ 2 galaxies with moderate luminosities ( L 8 μm < 10 11 L ☉ ), we find that the SFR can be estimated consistently from the multiwavelength data based on local luminosity correlations. However, 20%-30% of massive galaxies, and nearly all those with L 8 μm > 10 11 L ☉ , show a mid-IR excess that is likely due to the presence of obscured active nuclei, as shown in a companion paper. There is a tight and roughly linear correlation between stellar mass and SFR for 24 μm-detected galaxies. For a given mass, the SFR at z = 2 was larger by a factor of ~4 and ~30 relative to that in star-forming galaxies at z = 1 and 0, respectively. Typical ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z = 2 are relatively "transparent" to ultraviolet light, and their activity is long lived ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {gtrsim} 400 Myr), unlike that in local ULIRGs and high-redshift submillimeter-selected galaxies. ULIRGs are the common mode of star formation in massive galaxies at z = 2, and the high duty cycle suggests that major mergers are not the dominant trigger for this activity. Current galaxy formation models underpredict the normalization of the mass-SFR correlation by about a factor of 4 and the space density of ULIRGs by an order of magnitude but give better agreement for z > 1.4 quiescent galaxies.},

We use HST grism redshifts and extensive photometry in all five 3D- HST /CANDELS fields, more than doubling the area used previously for such studies, and combine these data with Keck MOSFIRE and NIRSPEC spectroscopy. We first confirm that a population of massive, compact, star-forming galaxies exists at z ≳ 2, using K -band spectroscopy of 25 of these objects at 2.0 < z < 2.5. They have a median [N ii ]/H α ratio of 0.6, are highly obscured with SFR(tot)/SFR(H α ) ∼10, and have a large range of observed line widths. We infer from the kinematics and spatial distribution of H α that the galaxies have rotating disks of ionized gas that are a factor of ∼2 more extended than the stellar distribution. By combining measurements of individual galaxies, we find that the kinematics are consistent with a nearly Keplerian fall-off from V rot ∼ 500 km s −1 at 1 kpc to V rot ∼ 250 km s −1 at 7 kpc, and that the total mass out to this radius is dominated by the dense stellar component. Next, we study the size and mass evolution of the progenitors of compact massive galaxies. Even though individual galaxies may have had complex histories with periods of compaction and mergers, we show that the population of progenitors likely followed a simple inside-out growth track in the size–mass plane of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/813/1/23/apj520554ieqn1.gif] {${\rm{\Delta }}\mathrm{log}{r}_{{\rm{e}}}\sim 0.3{\rm{\Delta }}\mathrm{log}{M}_{{\rm{stars}}}.$} This mode of growth gradually increases the stellar mass within a fixed physical radius, and galaxies quench when they reach a stellar density or velocity dispersion threshold. As shown in other studies, the mode of growth changes after quenching, as dry mergers take the galaxies on a relatively steep track in the size–mass plane.},

The evolution in number density of these extreme objects over cosmic time is the crucial constraining factor for the models of massive galaxy assembly. We select a large sample of ~200 intermediate-redshift massive compacts from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) spectroscopy by identifying point-like Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometric sources with spectroscopic signatures of evolved redshifted galaxies. A subset of our targets have publicly available high-resolution ground-based images that we use to augment the dynamical and stellar population properties of these systems by their structural parameters. We confirm that all BOSS compact candidates are as compact as their high-redshift massive counterparts and less than half the size of similarly massive systems at z ~ 0. We use the completeness-corrected numbers of BOSS compacts to compute lower limits on their number densities in narrow redshift bins spanning the range of our sample. The abundance of extremely dense quiescent galaxies at 0.2 < z < 0.6 is in excellent agreement with the number densities of these systems at high redshift. Our lower limits support the models of massive galaxy assembly through a series of minor mergers over the redshift range 0 < z < 2.},

We attempt to identify the evolutionary pathways between the various spectral classes in order to search for the progenitors of the numerous poststarburst galaxies. The comparison of the spectra of the distant galaxy populations with samples drawn from the local universe leads us to identify a significant population of dust-enshrouded starburst galaxies, showing both strong Balmer absorption and relatively modest [O II ] emission, that we believe are the most likely progenitors of the poststarburst population. We present the differences between the field and cluster galaxies at z =0.4-0.5. We then compare the spectral and morphological properties of the distant cluster galaxies, exploring the connection between the quenching of star formation inferred from the spectra and the strong evolution of the S0 population discussed by Dressler et al. We conclude that either two different timescales and/or two different physical processes are responsible for the spectral and morphological transformation.},

Little is known about how they formed, but their evolved, dense stellar populations suggest formation within intense, compact starbursts 1-2 Gyr earlier (at 3 < z < 6). Simulations show that gas-rich major mergers can give rise to such starbursts, which produce dense remnants. Submillimeter-selected galaxies (SMGs) are prime examples of intense, gas-rich starbursts. With a new, representative spectroscopic sample of compact, quiescent galaxies at z = 2 and a statistically well-understood sample of SMGs, we show that z = 3-6 SMGs are consistent with being the progenitors of z = 2 quiescent galaxies, matching their formation redshifts and their distributions of sizes, stellar masses, and internal velocities. Assuming an evolutionary connection, their space densities also match if the mean duty cycle of SMG starbursts is ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/782/2/68/apj488224ieqn1.gif] {$42^{+40}_{-29}$} Myr (consistent with independent estimates), which indicates that the bulk of stars in these massive galaxies were formed in a major, early surge of star formation. These results suggest a coherent picture of the formation history of the most massive galaxies in the universe, from their initial burst of violent star formation through their appearance as high stellar-density galaxy cores and to their ultimate fate as giant ellipticals.},

The median ratio of the effective radius in rest-frame V -band light to that in mass surface density is ~2 during the quiescent remnant phase. This is typically expressed by a negative color gradient (i.e., red core), which we expect to correlate with the integrated color of the system.

Although this is commonly attributed to violent mergers, the properties of many of these galaxies are incompatible with such events, showing gas-rich, clumpy, extended rotating disks not dominated by spheroids. Cosmological simulations and clustering theory are used to explore how these galaxies acquired their gas. Here we report that they are `stream-fed galaxies', formed from steady, narrow, cold gas streams that penetrate the shock-heated media of massive dark matter haloes. A comparison with the observed abundance of star-forming galaxies implies that most of the input gas must rapidly convert to stars. One-third of the stream mass is in gas clumps leading to mergers of mass ratio greater than 1:10, and the rest is in smoother flows. With a merger duty cycle of 0.1, three-quarters of the galaxies forming stars at a given rate are fed by smooth streams. The rarer, submillimetre galaxies that form stars even more intensely are largely merger-induced starbursts. Unlike destructive mergers, the streams are likely to keep the rotating disk configuration intact, although turbulent and broken into giant star-forming clumps that merge into a central spheroid. This stream-driven scenario for the formation of discs and spheroids is an alternative to the merger picture.},

  abstract    = {We present results from the KMOS lensing survey-KLENS which is exploiting gravitational lensing to study the kinematics of 24 star forming galaxies at $1.4<z<3.5$ with a median mass of $\rm log(M_\star/M_\odot)=9.6$ and median star formation rate (SFR) of $\rm 7.5\,M_\odot\,yr^{-1}$. We find that 25% of these low-mass/low-SFR galaxies are rotation dominated, while the majority of our sample shows no velocity gradient. When combining our data with other surveys, we find that the fraction of rotation dominated galaxies increases with the stellar mass, and decreases for galaxies with a positive offset from the main sequence. We also investigate the evolution of the intrinsic velocity dispersion, $\sigma_0$, as a function of the redshift, $z$, and stellar mass, $\rm M_\star$, assuming galaxies in quasi-equilibrium (Toomre Q parameter equal to 1). From the $z-\sigma_0$ relation, we find that the redshift evolution of the velocity dispersion is mostly expected for massive galaxies ($\rm log(M_\star/M_\odot)>10$). We derive a $\rm M_\star-\sigma_0$ relation, using the Tully-Fisher relation, which highlights that a different evolution of the velocity dispersion is expected depending on the stellar mass, with lower velocity dispersions for lower masses, and an increase for higher masses, stronger at higher redshift. The observed velocity dispersions from this work and from comparison samples spanning $0<z<3.5$ appear to follow this relation, except at higher redshift ($z>2$), where we observe higher velocity dispersions for low masses ($\rm log(M_\star/M_\odot)\sim 9.6$) and lower velocity dispersions for high masses ($\rm log(M_\star/M_\odot)\sim 10.9$) than expected. This discrepancy could, for instance, suggest that galaxies at high-$z$ do not satisfy the stability criterion, or that the adopted parametrisation of the specific star formation rate and molecular properties fail at high redshift.},

  abstract    = {We present the results of a multiwavelength survey of HI-excess galaxies, an intriguing population with large HI reservoirs associated with little current star formation. These galaxies have stellar masses $M_{\star} >10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$, and were identified as outliers in the gas fraction vs. NUV$-r$ color and stellar mass surface density scaling relations based on the GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey (GASS). We obtained HI interferometry with the GMRT, Keck optical long-slit spectroscopy and deep optical imaging (where available) for four galaxies. Our analysis reveals multiple possible reasons for the HI excess in these systems. One galaxy, AGC 10111, shows an HI disk that is counter-rotating with respect to the stellar bulge, a clear indication of external origin of the gas. Another galaxy appears to host a Malin 1-type disk, where a large specific angular momentum has to be invoked to explain the extreme $M_{\rm HI}$/$M_{\star}$ ratio of 166$\%$. The other two galaxies have early-type morphology with very high gas fractions. The lack of merger signatures (unsettled gas, stellar shells and streams) in these systems suggests that these gas-rich disks have been built several Gyr-s ago, but it remains unclear how the gas reservoirs were assembled. Numerical simulations of large cosmological volumes are needed to gain insight into the formation of these rare and interesting systems.},

Each galaxy received an average of 40 independent classifications, which we combine into detailed morphological information on galaxy features such as clumpiness, bar instabilities, spiral structure, and merger and tidal signatures. We apply a consensus-based classifier weighting method that preserves classifier independence while effectively down-weighting significantly outlying classifications. After analysing the effect of varying image depth on reported classifications, we also provide depth-corrected classifications which both preserve the information in the deepest observations and also enable the use of classifications at comparable depths across the full survey. Comparing the Galaxy Zoo classifications to previous classifications of the same galaxies shows very good agreement; for some applications, the high number of independent classifications provided by Galaxy Zoo provides an advantage in selecting galaxies with a particular morphological profile, while in others the combination of Galaxy Zoo with other classifications is a more promising approach than using any one method alone. We combine the Galaxy Zoo classifications of `smooth' galaxies with parametric morphologies to select a sample of featureless discs at 1 {\le} z {\le} 3, which may represent a dynamically warmer progenitor population to the settled disc galaxies seen at later epochs.},

  abstract  = {Major galaxy-galaxy merging can play an important role in the history of massive galaxies (stellar masses $\gt$ 2E10 Msun) over cosmic time. An important way to measure the impact of major merging is to study close pairs of galaxies stellar mass or flux ratios between 1 and 4. We improve on the best recent efforts by probing merging of lower mass galaxies, anchoring evolutionary trends from five Hubble Space Telescope Legacy fields in the Cosmic Assembly Near-Infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) to the nearby universe using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to measure the fraction of massive galaxies in such pairs during six epochs spanning 0$\lt$z$\lt$3. We perform comprehensive tests of the impact of pair selection techniques, demonstrating that individual selection items such as redshift proximity, mass or flux ratios, projected separations and corrections for random pairing play an important role, thus, the computed fractions are strongly dependent on the employed pair selection. For a range of projected separations (5-30 to 5-50 kpc), the mass-ratio fraction increases from 4-7\% (z\~{}0) to 9-16\% (z = 1.0-1.5), then turns over and decreases to 5-10\% at z=3. Yet, for flux ratio defined pairs we find higher fractions that continue to increase with redshift with no turnover. We estimate merger rates from the mass-ratio fractions using simple time scale assumptions. Despite good agreement with previous studies up to z\~{}1-1.5, our merger rates are in tension with those predicted by simulations at z$\gt$1.5. This implies that major merging may not be as important at high redshifts as previously thought, merger timescales may not be fully understood, or we may be missing evidence of mergers at z\~{}2-3 owing to CANDELS selections effects. Next, we will analyze pair fractions and merging timescales within realistic mocks of CANDELS from state of the art Semi-Analytic Model (SAM) to better understand and calibrate our empirical results.},

  abstract      = {The rate of major galaxy-galaxy merging is theoretically predicted to steadily increase with redshift during the peak epoch of massive galaxy development ($1{\leq}z{\leq}3$). We use close-pair statistics to objectively study the incidence of massive galaxies (stellar $M\_{1}{\geq}2{\times}10^{10}M\_{\odot}$) hosting major companions ($1{\leq}M\_{1}/M\_{2}{\leq}4$; i.e., $\lt$4:1) at six epochs spanning $0{\lt}z{\lt}3$. We select companions from a nearly complete, mass-limited ($\geq5{\times}10^{9}M\_{\odot}$) sample of 23,696 galaxies in the five CANDELS fields and the SDSS. Using $5-50$ kpc projected separation and close redshift proximity criteria, we find that the major companion fraction $f\_{\mathrm{mc}}(z)$ based on stellar mass-ratio (MR) selection increases from 6\% ($z{\sim}0$) to 16\% ($z{\sim}0.8$), then turns over at $z{\sim}1$ and decreases to 7\% ($z{\sim}3$). Instead, if we use a major F160W flux ratio (FR) selection, we find that $f\_{\mathrm{mc}}(z)$ increases steadily until $z=3$ owing to increasing contamination from minor (MR$\gt$4:1) companions at $z\gt1$. We show that these evolutionary trends are statistically robust to changes in companion proximity. We find disagreements between published results are resolved when selection criteria are closely matched. If we compute merger rates using constant fraction-to-rate conversion factors ($C\_{\mathrm{merg,pair}}{=}0.6$ and $T\_{\mathrm{obs,pair}}{=}0.65\mathrm{Gyr}$), we find that MR rates disagree with theoretical predictions at $z{\gt}1.5$. Instead, if we use an evolving $T\_{\mathrm{obs,pair}}(z){\propto}(1+z)^{-2}$ from Snyder et al., our MR-based rates agree with theory at $0{\lt}z{\lt}3$. Our analysis underscores the need for detailed calibration of $C\_{\mathrm{merg,pair}}$ and $T\_{\mathrm{obs,pair}}$ as a function of redshift, mass and companion selection criteria to better constrain the empirical major merger history.},

For J1346+5228, the distribution of masers is consistent with a disk, but the faint high-velocity masers are only marginally detected, and we constrain the mass of the SMBH to be in the range 1.5-2.0*10^7Msun. The origin of the masers in Mrk1210 is less clear, as the systemic and high-velocity masers are misaligned and show a disorganized velocity structure. We present one possible model in which the masers originate in a tilted, warped disk, but we do not rule out the possibility of other explanations including outflow masers. In NGC6926, we detect a set of redshifted masers, clustered within a pc of each other, and a single blueshifted maser about 4.4pc away, an offset that would be unusually large for a maser disk system. Nevertheless, if it is a disk system, we estimate the enclosed mass to be M_SMBH<4.8*10^7 Msun . For NGC5793, we detect redshifted masers spaced about 1.4pc from a clustered set of blueshifted features. The orientation of the structure supports a disk scenario as suggested by Hagiwara et al.(2001). We estimate the enclosed mass to be M SMBH<1.3*10^7 Msun. For NGC2824 and J0350-0127, the masers may be associated with pc or sub-pc scale jets or outflows.},

Out of an original 3.4 Mpc$^3$/h$^3$ cosmological box, a sample of 27 systems are zoomed-in from z=70 to z=0. Gas and stellar properties are confronted to the observations in the greatest details: in addition to the galaxy global properties, we investigate the model galaxy velocity dispersion profiles, half-light radii, star formation histories, metallicity distributions, and [Mg/Fe] abundance ratios. The formation and sustainability of the metallicity gradients and kinetically distinct stellar populations are also tackled. We show how the properties of six Local Group dwarf galaxies, NGC 6622, Andromeda II, Sculptor, Sextans, Ursa Minor and Draco are reproduced, and how they pertain to three main galaxy build-up modes. Our results indicate that the interaction with a massive central galaxy could be needed for a handful of Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies only, the vast majority of the systems and their variety of star formation histories arising naturally from a $\Lambda$CDM framework. We find that models fitting well the local Group dwarf galaxies are embedded in dark haloes of mass between $5\times 10^8$ to a few $10^9\,\rm{M_\odot}$, without any missing satellite problem. We confirm the failure of the abundance matching approach at the mass scale of dwarf galaxies. Some of the observed faint however gas-rich galaxies with residual star formation, such as Leo T and Leo P, remain challenging. They point out the need of a better understanding of the UV-background heating.},

  title       = {Evidence of a non universal stellar Initial Mass Function. Insights from HST optical imaging of 6 Ultra Faint Dwarf Milky Way Satellites},
  abstract    = {Using deep HST/ACS observations, we demonstrate that the sub-solar stellar initial mass function (IMF) of 6 ultra-faint dwarf Milky Way Satellites (UFDs) is more bottom light than the IMF of the Milky Way disk. Our data have a lower mass limit of about 0.45 M$_{\odot}$, while the upper limit is $\sim 0.8$ M$_\odot$, set by the turn-off mass of these old, metal poor systems. If formulated as a single power law, we obtain a shallower IMF slope than the "Salpeter" value of $-2.3$, ranging from $-1.01$ for Leo IV, to $-1.87$ for Bo\"otes I. The significance of such deviations depends on the galaxy and is typically 95\% or more. When modeled as a log-normal, the IMF fit results in a larger peak mass than in the Milky Way disk, however a Milky Way disk value for the characteristic system mass ($\sim0.22$ M$_{\odot}$) is excluded only at 68\% significance, and only for some UFDs in the sample. We find that the IMF slope correlates well with the galaxy mean metallicity and, to a lesser degree, with the velocity dispersion and the total mass. The strength of the observed correlations is limited by shot noise in the number of observed stars, but future space-based missions like JWST and WFIRST will both enhance the number of dwarf Milky Way Satellites that can be studied in such detail, and the observation depth for individual galaxies.},

At a distance of 210 Mpc, and a nuclear separation of $\sim$4 kpc, Mrk 463 is an excellent laboratory to study the gas dynamics, star formation processes and supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion in a late-stage gas-rich major galaxy merger. The IFU observations reveal a complex morphology, including tidal tails, star-forming clumps, and emission line regions. The optical data, which map the full extent of the merger, show evidence for a biconical outflow and material outflowing at $>$600 km s$^{-1}$, both associated with the Mrk 463E nucleus, together with large scale gradients likely related to the ongoing galaxy merger. We further find an emission line region $\sim$11 kpc south of Mrk 463E that is consistent with being photoionized by an AGN. Compared to the current AGN luminosity, the energy budget of the cloud implies a luminosity drop in Mrk 463E by a factor 3-20 over the last 40,000 years. The ALMA observations of $^{12}$CO(2-1) and adjacent 1mm continuum reveal the presence of $\sim$10$^{9}$M$_\odot$ in molecular gas in the system. The molecular gas shows velocity gradients of $\sim$800 km/s and $\sim$400 km/s around the Mrk 463E and 463W nuclei, respectively. We conclude that in this system the infall of $\sim$100s $M_\odot$/yr of molecular gas is in rough balance with the removal of ionized gas by a biconical outflow being fueled by a relatively small, $<$0.01% of accretion onto each SMBH.},

The stellar populations of these dwarf galaxies at $z=0$ are formed essentially entirely "in situ": over 90$\%$ of the stellar mass is formed in the main progenitor in all but two cases, and all 15 of the galaxies have >70$\%$ of their stellar mass formed in situ. Virtually all galaxy mergers occur prior to $z\sim3$, meaning that accreted stellar populations are ancient. On average, our simulated dwarfs undergo 5 galaxy mergers in their lifetimes, with typical pre-merger galaxy mass ratios that are less than 1:10. This merger frequency is generally comparable to what has been found in dissipationless simulations when coupled with abundance matching. Two of the simulated dwarfs have a luminous satellite companion at $z=0$. These ultra-faint dwarfs lie at or below current detectability thresholds but are intriguing targets for next-generation facilities. The small contribution of accreted stars make it extremely difficult to discern the effects of mergers in the vast majority of dwarfs either photometrically or using resolved-star color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). The important implication for near-field cosmology is that star formation histories of comparably massive galaxies derived from resolved CMDs should trace the build-up of stellar mass in one main system across cosmic time as opposed to reflecting the contributions of many individual star formation histories of merged dwarfs.},

  abstract     = {Galaxies are surrounded by sizeable gas reservoirs which host a significant amount of metals: the circum-galactic medium (CGM). The CGM acts as a mediator between the galaxy and the extra-galactic medium. However, our understanding of how galaxy mergers, a major evolutionary transformation, impact the CGM remains deficient. We present a theoretical study of the effect of galaxy mergers on the CGM. We use hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations of a major merger selected from the Illustris project such that the z=0 descendant has a halo mass and stellar mass comparable to the Milky Way. To study the CGM we then re-simulated this system at a 40 times better mass resolution, and included detailed post-processing ionization modelling. Our work demonstrates the effect the merger has on the characteristic size of the CGM, its metallicity, and the predicted covering fraction of various commonly observed gas-phase species, such as H I, C IV, and O VI. We show that merger-induced outflows can increase the CGM metallicity by 0.2-0.3 dex within 0.5 Gyr post-merger. These effects last up to 6 Gyr post-merger. While the merger increases the total metal covering fractions by factors of 2-3, the covering fractions of commonly observed UV ions decrease due to the hard ionizing radiation from the active galactic nucleus, which we model explicitly. Our study of the single simulated major merger presented in this work demonstrates the significant impact that a galaxy interaction can have on the size, metallicity, and observed column densities of the CGM.},

  title       = {Jeans Instability in a Universe with Dissipation},
  abstract    = {The problem of Jeans gravitational instability is investigated for static and expanding universes within the context of the five and thirteen field theories which account for viscous and thermal effects. For the five-field theory a general dispersion relation has been derived with the help of relevant linearized perturbation equations, showing that the shear viscosity parameter alters the propagating modes for large and small wavelengths. The behavior of density and temperature contrasts are analyzed for the hard-sphere model in detail. In the small wavelengths regime, increasing the amount of shear viscosity into the system forces the harmonic perturbations to damp faster, however, in the opposite limit larger values of shear viscosity lead to smaller values of density and temperature contrasts. For the hyperbolic case, the dispersion relation becomes a polynomial in the frequency with two orders higher in relation to the five-field theory, indicating that the effects associated with the shear viscosity and heat flux are non-trivial. The profile of Jeans mass in terms of the temperature and number density is explored by contrasting with several data of molecular clouds. Regarding the dynamical evolution of the density, temperature, stress and heat flux contrasts for a universe dominated by pressureless matter, we obtain also damped harmonic waves for small wavelengths. In the case of large wavelengths, the density and temperature contrasts grow with time (due to the Jeans mechanism) while the stress and heat flux contrasts heavily decay with time.},

In this paper we review the characteristics of the local interstellar medium that have been affected by supernovae. The kinematics, magnetic field, elemental abundances, and configuration of the nearest interstellar material support the view that the Sun is at the edge of the Loop I superbubble, which has merged into the low density Local Bubble. The energy source for the higher temperature X-ray emitting plasma pervading the Local Bubble is uncertain. Winds from massive stars and nearby supernovae, perhaps from the Sco-Cen Association, may have contributed radioisotopes found in the geologic record and galactic cosmic ray population. Nested supernova shells in the Orion and Sco-Cen regions suggest spatially distinct sites of episodic star formation. The heliosphere properties vary with the pressure of the surrounding interstellar cloud. A nearby supernova would modify this pressure equilibrium and thereby severely disrupt the heliosphere as well as the local interstellar medium.},

The most luminous quasars at $z>6$ are frequently observed but they represent only the tip of the iceberg as the majority of the low luminosity AGN population remains undetected. In the present study, we perform a radiation hydrodynamics cosmological simulation to study the growth of "normal" black holes in the high redshift universe. In our simulation we model the formation of Pop III and Pop II stars along with their chemical, mechanical and radiative feedback. We consider both UV and X-ray emission from an accreting BH to simulate its radiative feedback. The selected halo has a mass of $\rm 3 \times 10^{10}~M_{\odot}$ at $z=7.5$ and we turn on radiative feedback from a MBH seed of $\rm 10^5~M_{\odot}$ along with in-situ star formation at $z=12$ when the halo mass reaches well above the atomic cooling limit. We find that the MBH accretes only about 2200 $\rm M_{\odot}$ during 320 Myr and the average mass accretion onto the MBH is a few times $\rm 10^{-6}~M_{\odot}/yr$. Our results suggest that the stunted growth of MBH is a consequence of supernovae in tandem with MBH feedback which drive large outflows and evacuate the gas from MBH vicinity. This may explain why a population of low luminosity AGN has not been detected so-far at $z>6$; the large contrast between the star formation rate and the MBH accretion rate may make then hard to detect even in upcoming deep surveys.},

  abstract    = {We perform spatially-resolved, pixel-by-pixel SED fitting on galaxies up to $z\sim2.5$ in the Hubble Extreme Deep Field (XDF). Comparing stellar mass estimates from spatially resolved and spatially unresolved photometry we find that unresolved masses can be systematically underestimated by factors of up to 5. The ratio of the unresolved to resolved mass measurement depends on the galaxy's specific star formation rate (sSFR): at low sSFRs the bias is small, but above sSFR$\ \sim 10^{-9.5}$ yr$^{-1}$ the discrepancy increases rapidly such that galaxies with sSFRs$\ \sim 10^{-8}$ yr$^{-1}$ have unresolved mass estimates of only one half to one fifth of the resolved value. This result indicates that stellar masses estimated from spatially-unresolved datasets need to be systematically corrected, in some cases by large amounts, and we provide an analytic prescription for applying this correction. We show that correcting stellar mass measurements for this bias changes the normalization and slope of the star-forming main sequence and reduces its intrinsic width; most dramatically, correcting for the mass bias increases the stellar mass density of the Universe at high redshift and can resolve the long-standing discrepancy between the directly-measured cosmic star formation rate density at $z\gtrsim1$ and that inferred from stellar mass densities ("the missing mass problem").},

  abstract    = {With the advent of wide-area submillimeter surveys, a large number of high-redshift gravitationally lensed dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) has been revealed. Due to the simplicity of the selection criteria for candidate lensed sources in such surveys, identified as those with $S_{500\mu m} > 100$ mJy, uncertainties associated with the modelling of the selection function are expunged. The combination of these attributes makes submillimeter surveys ideal for the study of strong lens statistics. We carried out a pilot study of the lensing statistics of submillimetre-selected sources by making observations with the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) of a sample of strongly-lensed sources selected from surveys carried out with the Herschel Space Observatory. We attempted to reproduce the distribution of image separations for the lensed sources using a halo mass function taken from a numerical simulation which contains both dark matter and baryons. We used three different density distributions, one based on analytical fits to the halos formed in the EAGLE simulation and two density distributions (Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS) and SISSA) that have been used before in lensing studies. We found that we could reproduce the observed distribution with all three density distributions, as long as we imposed an upper mass transition of $\sim$$10^{13} M_{\odot}$ for the SIS and SISSA models, above which we assumed that the density distribution could be represented by an NFW profile. We show that we would need a sample of $\sim$500 lensed sources to distinguish between the density distributions, which is practical given the predicted number of lensed sources in the Herschel surveys.},

  abstract    = {We formulate a model of the conditional colour-magnitude distribution (CCMD) to describe the distribution of galaxy luminosity and colour as a function of halo mass. It consists of two populations of different colour distributions, dubbed pseudo-blue and pseudo-red, respectively, with each further separated into central and satellite galaxies. We define a global parameterization of these four colour-magnitude distributions and their dependence on halo mass, and we infer parameter values by simultaneously fitting the space densities and auto-correlation functions of 79 galaxy samples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey defined by fine bins in the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD). The model deprojects the overall galaxy CMD, revealing its tomograph along the halo mass direction. The bimodality of the colour distribution is driven by central galaxies at most luminosities, though at low luminosities it is driven by the difference between blue centrals and red satellites. For central galaxies, the two pseudo-colour components are distinct and orthogonal to each other in the CCMD: at fixed halo mass, pseudo-blue galaxies have a narrow luminosity range and broad colour range, while pseudo-red galaxies have a narrow colour range and broad luminosity range. For pseudo-blue centrals, luminosity correlates tightly with halo mass, while for pseudo-red galaxies colour correlates more tightly (redder galaxies in more massive haloes). The satellite fraction is higher for redder and for fainter galaxies, with colour a stronger indicator than luminosity. We discuss the implications of the results and further applications of the CCMD model.},

The most extreme are discovered through follow-up on candidates in large area surveys. Here we present 850 $\mu$m SCUBA-2 follow-up observations of 188 red DSFG candidates from the \textit{Herschel} Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey (HerMES) Large Mode Survey, covering 274 deg$^2$. We detected 87 per cent with a signal-to-noise ratio $>$ 3 at 850~$\mu$m. We introduce a new method for incorporating the confusion noise in our spectral energy distribution fitting by sampling correlated flux density fluctuations from a confusion limited map. The new 850~$\mu$m data provide a better constraint on the photometric redshifts of the candidates, with photometric redshift errors decreasing from $\sigma_z/(1+z)\approx0.21$ to $0.15$. Comparison spectroscopic redshifts also found little bias ($\langle (z-z_{\rm spec})/(1+z_{\rm spec})\rangle = 0.08 $). The mean photometric redshift is found to be 3.6 with a dispersion of $0.4$ and we identify 21 DSFGs with a high probability of lying at $z > 4$. After simulating our selection effects we find number counts are consistent with phenomenological galaxy evolution models. There is a statistically significant excess of WISE-1 and SDSS sources near our red galaxies, giving a strong indication that lensing may explain some of the apparently extreme objects. Nevertheless, our sample should include examples of galaxies with the highest star formation rates in the Universe ($\gg10^3$ M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$).},

  abstract    = {We present the SPHINX suite of cosmological adaptive mesh refinement simulations, the first radiation-hydrodynamical simulations to simultaneously capture large-scale reionization and the escape of ionizing radiation from thousands of resolved galaxies. Our $5$ and $10$ co-moving Mpc volumes resolve haloes down to the atomic cooling limit and model the inter-stellar medium with better than $\approx10$ pc resolution. The project has numerous goals in improving our understanding of reionization and making predictions for future observations. In this first paper we study how the inclusion of binary stars in computing stellar luminosities impacts reionization, compared to a model that includes only single stars. Owing to the suppression of galaxy growth via strong feedback, our galaxies are in good agreement with observational estimates of the galaxy luminosity function. We find that binaries have a significant impact on the timing of reionization: with binaries, our boxes are $99.9$ percent ionized by volume at $z\approx 7$, while without them our volumes fail to reionize by $z=6$. These results are robust to changes in volume size, resolution, and feedback efficiency. The escape of ionizing radiation from individual galaxies varies strongly and frequently. On average, binaries lead to escape fractions of $\approx 7-10$ percent, about $3.5$ times higher than with single stars only. The higher escape fraction is a result of a shallower decline in ionizing luminosity with age, and is the primary reason for earlier reionization, although the higher integrated luminosity with binaries also plays a sub-dominant role.},

  title       = {Measuring oxygen abundances from stellar spectra without oxygen lines},
  abstract    = {Oxygen is the most abundant "metal" element in stars and in the cosmos. But determining oxygen abundances in stars has proven challenging, because of the shortage of detectable atomic oxygen lines in their optical spectra as well as observational and theoretical complications with these lines (e.g., blends, 3D, non-LTE). Nonetheless, Ting et al. (2017) were recently able to demonstrate that oxygen abundances can be determined from low-resolution (R$\simeq$2000) optical spectra. Here we investigate the physical processes that enable such a measurement for cool stars, such as K-giants. We show that the strongest spectral diagnostics of oxygen come from the CNO atomic-molecular network, but are manifested in spectral features that do not involve oxygen. In the outer atmosphere layers most of the carbon is locked up in CO, and changes to the oxygen abundance directly affect the abundances of all other carbon-bearing molecules, thereby changing the strength of CH, CN, and C$_2$ features across the optical spectrum. In deeper atmosphere layers most of the carbon is in atomic form, and any change in the oxygen abundance has little effect on the other carbon-bearing molecules. The key physical effect enabling such oxygen abundance measurements is that spectral features in the optical arise from both the CO-dominant and the atomic carbon-dominant regions, providing non-degenerate constraints on both C and O. Beyond the case at hand, the results show that physically sound abundances measurements need not be limited to those elements that have observable lines themselves.},

  abstract    = {In the last decade, it has become clear that the dust-enshrouded star formation contributes significantly to early galaxy evolution. Detection of dust is therefore essential in determining the properties of galaxies in the high-redshift universe. This requires observations at the (sub-)millimeter wavelengths. Unfortunately, sensitivity and background confusion of single dish observations on the one hand, and mapping efficiency of interferometers on the other hand, pose unique challenges to observers. One promising route to overcome these difficulties is intensity mapping of fluctuations which exploits the confusion-limited regime and measures the collective light emission from all sources, including unresolved faint galaxies. We discuss in this contribution how 2D and 3D intensity mapping can measure the dusty star formation at high redshift, through the Cosmic Infrared Background (2D) and [CII] fine structure transition (3D) anisotropies.},

We estimate the virial black hole mass from broad Halpha and/or \hbeta, and infer quasar redshifts from O III5007 emission lines. All the measurements and derived quantities are publicly available. The comparison between O III5007 based redshifts and the visual inspection redshifts included in DR12Q indicates that the visual inspection redshifts are robust. We find that the FWHMs of the broad Halpha are consistent with those of the broad Hbeta, while both the equivalent widths and line luminosities of the broad Halpha are obviously larger than the corresponding quantities of the broad Hbeta. We also find that there is an obviously systematic offset between the Hbeta and Halpha based mass if they are inferred from the empirical relationships in the literature. Using our large quasar sample, we have improved the Hbeta and Halpha based mass estimators by minimizing the difference between the Hbeta- and Halpha-based mass. For the black hole mass estimator (Equation (1)), we find that the coefficients (a,b)=(7.00,0.50) for the Halpha and (a,b)=(6.96,0.50) for the Hbeta are the best choices.},

A complete sample of starless and prestellar cores and embedded protostars is identified. Other results from the Herschel Gould Belt Survey have shown spatial correlation between the distribution of dense cores and the filamentary structure within the molecular clouds. We go further and show correlations between the properties of these cores and their spatial distribution within the clouds, with a particular focus on the mass distribution of the dense cores with respect to their filamentary proximity. We find that only lower-mass starless cores form away from filaments, while all of the higher-mass prestellar cores form in close proximity to, or directly on the filamentary structure. This result supports the paradigm that prestellar cores mostly form on filaments. We analyse the mass distribution across the molecular cloud, finding evidence that the region around the Coronet appears to be at a more dynamically advanced evolutionary stage to the rest of the clumps within the cloud.},

We introduce the \textit{kinematic concentration} parameter, $c_k$, the ratio between the global and local degree of energy equipartition reached by a cluster, and show through extensive direct $N$-body simulations that clusters approaching core collapse and in the post-core collapse phase are strictly characterized by $c_k>1$. The kinematic concentration provides a suitable diagnostic to identify core-collapsed clusters, independent from any other previous methods based on photometry. We also explore the effects of incomplete radial and stellar mass coverage on the calculation of $c_k$ and find that our method can be applied to state-of-art kinematic datasets.},

Exploring the IR excess vs UV-slope (IRX-beta) relation we find that the most luminous galaxies are consistent with the Meurer law, while the less luminous galaxies lie below this relation. Using the results of a two-dimensional modelling of the HST H_160-band imaging, we derive a median Sersic index of n=1.4 +0.3 -0.1 and a median half-light radius of R_1/2 = 4.8 +/ 0.4 kpc. Based on a visual-like classification in the same band, we find that the dominant component for most of the galaxies at all redshifts is a disk-like structure, although there is a transition from irregular disks to disks with a spheroidal component at z~1.4, which morphologically supports the scenario of SMGs as progenitors of massive elliptical galaxies.},

  title       = {Dense gas and star formation in individual Giant Molecular Clouds in M31},
  abstract    = {Studies both of entire galaxies and of local Galactic star formation indicate a dependency of a molecular cloud's star formation rate (SFR) on its dense gas mass. In external galaxies, such measurements are derived from HCN(1-0) observations, usually encompassing many Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) at once. The Andromeda galaxy (M31) is a unique laboratory to study the relation of the SFR and HCN emission down to GMC scales at solar-like metallicities. In this work, we correlate our composite SFR determinations with archival HCN, HCO$^+$, and CO observations, resulting in a sample of nine reasonably representative GMCs. We find that, at the scale of individual clouds, it is important to take into account both obscured and unobscured star formation to determine the SFR. When correlated against the dense-gas mass from HCN, we find that the SFR is low, in spite of these refinements. We nevertheless retrieve an SFR - dense-gas mass correlation, confirming that these SFR tracers are still meaningful on GMC scales. The correlation improves markedly when we consider the HCN/CO ratio instead of HCN by itself. This nominally indicates a dependency of the SFR on the dense-gas fraction, in contradiction to local studies. However, we hypothesize that this partly reflects the limited dynamic range in dense-gas mass, and partly that the ratio of single-pointing HCN and CO measurements may be less prone to systematics like sidelobes. In this case, the HCN/CO ratio would importantly be a better empirical measure of the dense-gas content itself.},

  abstract    = {The data volume generated by astronomical surveys is growing rapidly. Traditional analysis techniques in spectroscopy either demand intensive human interaction or are computationally expensive. In this scenario, machine learning, and unsupervised clustering algorithms in particular offer interesting alternatives. The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) offers a vast data set of near-infrared stellar spectra which is perfect for testing such alternatives. Apply an unsupervised classification scheme based on $K$-means to the massive APOGEE data set. Explore whether the data are amenable to classification into discrete classes. We apply the $K$-means algorithm to 153,847 high resolution spectra ($R\approx22,500$). We discuss the main virtues and weaknesses of the algorithm, as well as our choice of parameters. We show that a classification based on normalised spectra captures the variations in stellar atmospheric parameters, chemical abundances, and rotational velocity, among other factors. The algorithm is able to separate the bulge and halo populations, and distinguish dwarfs, sub-giants, RC and RGB stars. However, a discrete classification in flux space does not result in a neat organisation in the parameters space. Furthermore, the lack of obvious groups in flux space causes the results to be fairly sensitive to the initialisation, and disrupts the efficiency of commonly-used methods to select the optimal number of clusters. Our classification is publicly available, including extensive online material associated with the APOGEE Data Release 12 (DR12). Our description of the APOGEE database can enormously help with the identification of specific types of targets for various applications. We find a lack of obvious groups in flux space, and identify limitations of the $K$-means algorithm in dealing with this kind of data.},

  abstract    = {Intermediate-mass black holes are the missing link that connects supermassive and stellar-mass black holes and are key to understanding galaxy evolution. Gravitational waves, like photons, can be lensed by these objects. In the diffraction limit a gravitational wave can self interfere when bent by a mass of Schwarzschild radius comparable to its wavelength, modifying the observed waveform. The required point mass scale is $\sim 100-1000~\rm M_\odot$ for significant wave effect to occur for compact binaries in the LIGO band, corresponding to intermediate-mass black hole deflectors. We perform a mock data study using lensed gravitational waves to investigate detectability of these intermediate-mass black hole deflectors in the LIGO-Virgo detector network. In particular, we simulate gravitational waves with different source distributions lensed by an astrophysical population of intermediate-mass black holes and use standard LIGO tools to infer the properties of these lenses. We show that one can discover intermediate-mass black holes through their lensing effects on gravitational waves in the LIGO-Virgo detector network. Moreover, we demonstrate that one can detect intermediate-mass black holes at $\rm 98 \%$ confidence level in $\sim \rm 20 \%$ of the lensed cases, subject to the astrophysical lens population.},

Supernova yields are prepared with nucleosynthesis calculations of metal-free stars with various initial masses ($M=$13, 15, 25, 40 and 100 $M_{\odot}$) and explosion energies ($E_{51}=E/10^{51}$[erg]$=0.5-60$) to include low-energy, normal-energy, and high-energy explosions. We adopt the mixing-fallback model to take into account possible asymmetry in the supernova explosions and the yields that best-fit the observed abundance patterns of the EMP stars are searched by varying the model parameters. We find that the abundance patterns of the EMP stars are predominantly best-fitted with the supernova yields with initial masses $M<40 M_{\odot}$, and that more than than half of the stars are best fitted with the $M=25 M_\odot$ hypernova ($E_{51}=10$) models. The results also indicate that the majority of the primordial supernovae have ejected $10^{-2}-10^{-1} M_\odot$ of $^{56}$Ni leaving behind a compact remnant, either a neutron star or a black hole, with mass in a range of $\sim 1.5-5 M_{\odot}$. The results suggest that the masses of the first stars responsible for the first metal-enrichment are predominantly $< 40 M_{\odot}$. This implies that the higher mass first stars were either less abundant or directly collapsing into a blackhole without ejecting heavy elements or that a supernova explosion of a higher-mass first star inhibits the formation of the next generation of low-mass stars at [Fe/H]$<-3$.},

In this case the considered stars have relative parallax errors less than 200%. Following the well-known statistical approach, we assume that the kinematic parameters found from the line-of-sight velocities $V_r$ are less dependent on errors of distances than the found from the velocity components $V_l$. From values of the first derivative of the Galactic rotation angular velocity $\Omega{'}_0$, found from the analysis of velocities $V_r$ and $V_l$ separately, the scale factor of distances is determined. We found that from the sample of Cepheids the scale of distances of the TGAS should be reduced by 3%, and from the sample of OB stars, on the contrary, the scale should be increased by 9%.},

  abstract    = {The orbital angular momentum of individual stars in galactic discs can be permanently changed through torques from transient spiral patterns. Interactions at the corotation resonance dominate these changes and have the further property of conserving orbital circularity. We derived in an earlier paper an analytic criterion that an unperturbed stellar orbit must satisfy in order for such an interaction to occur i.e. for it to be in a trapped orbit around corotation. We here use this criterion in an investigation of how the efficiency of induced radial migration for a population of disc stars varies with the angular momentum distribution of that population. We frame our results in terms of the velocity dispersion of the population, this being an easier observable than is the angular momentum distribution. Specifically, we investigate how the fraction of stars in trapped orbits at corotation varies with the velocity dispersion of the population, for a system with an assumed flat rotation curve. Our analytic results agree with the finding from simulations that radial migration is less effective in populations with 'hotter' kinematics. We further quantify the dependence of this trapped fraction on the strength of the spiral pattern, finding a higher trapped fraction for higher amplitude perturbations.},

This may in part be due to the lack of knowledge about the possible radio spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of star-forming galaxies. We constrain the radio SED of a complete sample of highly star-forming galaxies ($SFR>100\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}/\,\mathrm{yr}$) based on the VLA-COSMOS $1.4\,\mathrm{GHz}$ Joint and $3\,\mathrm{GHz}$ Large Project catalogs. We reduce archival GMRT $325\,\mathrm{MHz}$ and $610\,\mathrm{MHz}$ observations, broadening the rest-frame frequency range to $0.3-15\,\mathrm{GHz}$. Employing survival analysis and fitting a double power law SED, we find that the slope steepens from a spectral index of $\alpha_1=0.51\pm 0.04$ below $4.5\,\mathrm{GHz}$ to $\alpha_2=0.98\pm0.07$ above $4.5\,\mathrm{GHz}.$ Our results suggest that the use of a K-correction assuming a single power-law radio SED for star forming galaxies is likely not the root cause of the IRRC trend.},

  abstract    = {While molecular quasar absorption systems provide unique probes of the physical and chemical properties of the gas as well as original constraints on fundamental physics and cosmology, their detection remains challenging. Here we present the results from a complete survey for molecular gas in thirty-nine absorption systems selected solely upon the detection of neutral carbon lines in SDSS spectra, without any prior knowledge of the atomic or molecular gas content. H2 is found in all twelve systems (including seven new detections) where the corresponding lines are covered by the instrument setups and measured to have log N(H2)>=18, indicating a self-shielded regime. We also report seven CO detections (7/39) down to log N(CO)~13.5, including a new one, and put stringent constraints on N(CO) for the remaining 32 systems. N(CO) and N(CI) are found to be strongly correlated with N(CO)/N(CI)~1/10. This suggests that the CI-selected absorber population is probing gas deeper than the HI-H2 transition in which a substantial fraction of the total hydrogen in the cloud is in the form of H2. We conclude that targeting CI-bearing absorbers is a very efficient way to find high-metallicity molecular absorbers. However, probing the molecular content in lower metallicity regimes as well as high column density neutral gas remains to be undertaken to unravel the processes of gas conversion in normal high-z galaxies},

Based on a deep image of the Ophiuchus cluster in the r' band obtained at the Canada France Hawaii Telescope with the MegaCam camera, we have applied an iterative process to subtract the contribution of the numerous stars that pollute the image, due to the low Galactic latitude of the cluster, and obtained a photometric catalogue of 2818 galaxies fully complete at r'=20.5 mag and still 91% complete at r'=21.5 mag. We use this catalogue to derive the cluster Galaxy Luminosity Function (GLF) for the overall image and for a region (hereafter the "rectangle" region) covering exactly the same physical size as the region in which the GLF of the Coma cluster was studied by Adami et al. (2007). We then compute density maps based on an adaptive kernel technique, for different magnitude limits, and define three circular regions covering 0.08, 0.08 and 0.06 deg^2 respectively centered on the cluster (C), northwest (NW) and southeast (SE) of the cluster, in which we compute the GLFs. The GLF fits are much better when a Gaussian is added to the usual Schechter function, to account for the excess of very bright galaxies. Compared to Coma, Ophiuchus shows a strong excess of bright galaxies. The properties of the two nearby very massive clusters Ophiuchus and Coma are quite comparable, though they seem embedded in different large scale environments. Our interpretation is that Ophiuchus has built up long ago, as confirmed by its relaxed state (see paper I) while Coma is still in the process of forming.},

In previous works we explored the relative role of the two main competing BH seed formation channels, Population III remnants (low-mass seeds) and direct collapse BHs (high-mass seeds), investigating the properties of their host galaxies in a cosmological context. Building on this analysis, we predict here the spectral energy distribution and observational features of low- and high-mass BH seeds selected among the progenitors of a z~6 SMBH. We derive the processed emission from both accreting BHs and stars by using the photo-ionization code Cloudy, accounting for the evolution of metallicity and dust-to-gas mass ratio in the interstellar medium of the host galaxies, as predicted by the cosmological data- constrained model GAMETE/QSOdust. We show how future missions like JWST and ATHENA will be able to detect the light coming from SMBH progenitors already at z~16. We build upon previous complementary studies and propose a method based on the combined analysis of near infrared (NIR) colors, IR excess (IRX) and UV continuum slopes (i.e. color-color and IRX-Beta diagrams) to distinguish growing seed BH host galaxies from starburst-dominated systems in JWST surveys.

As a main result of this work we can state that the Sextans dwarf spheroidal stopped forming stars less than $\sim1.3$ Gyr after Big Bang in correspondance to the end of the reionization epoch. We have been able to constrain the duration of the main burst of star formation to $\sim0.6$ Gyr. From the calculation of the mechanical luminosity released from supernovae (SNe) during the brief episode of star formation, there are strong indications that SNe could have played an important role in the fate of Sextans, by removing almost completely the gas component, so preventing a prolonged star formation.},

  title       = {An ALMA view of star formation efficiency suppression in early-type galaxies after gas-rich minor mergers},
  abstract    = {Gas-rich minor mergers contribute significantly to the gas reservoir of early-type galaxies (ETGs) at low redshift, yet the star formation efficiency (SFE; the star formation rate divided by the molecular gas mass) appears to be strongly suppressed following some of these events, in contrast to the more well-known merger-driven starbursts. We present observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) of six ETGs, which have each recently undergone a gas-rich minor merger, as evidenced by their disturbed stellar morphologies. These galaxies were selected because they exhibit extremely low SFEs. We use the resolving power of ALMA to study the morphology and kinematics of the molecular gas. The majority of our galaxies exhibit spatial and kinematical irregularities, such as detached gas clouds, warps, and other asymmetries. These asymmetries support the interpretation that the suppression of the SFE is caused by dynamical effects stabilizing the gas against gravitational collapse. Through kinematic modelling we derive high velocity dispersions and Toomre Q stability parameters for the gas, but caution that such measurements in edge-on galaxies suffer from degeneracies. We estimate merger ages to be about 100~Myr based on the observed disturbances in the gas distribution. Furthermore, we determine that these galaxies lie, on average, two orders of magnitude below the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation for star-forming galaxies as well as below the relation for relaxed ETGs. We discuss potential dynamical processes responsible for this strong suppression of star formation surface density at fixed molecular gas surface density.},

We identify 59 candidate protostars based on the presence of compact submillimeter emission, complementing these observations with existing Herschel/SPIRE maps. Of our candidate protostars, 24 are associated with young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Spitzer and Herschel/PACS catalogs of 166 and 60 YSOs, respectively (177 unique), confirming their protostellar nature. The remaining 35 candidate protostars are in regions, particularly around LkHalpha 101, where the background cloud emission is too bright to verify or rule out the presence of the compact 70 micron emission that is expected for a protostellar source. We keep these candidate protostars in our sample but note that they may indeed be prestellar in nature. Our observations are sensitive to the high end of the mass distribution in Auriga-Cal. We find that the disparity between the richness of infrared star forming objects in Orion A and the sparsity in Auriga-Cal extends to the submillimeter, suggesting that the relative star formation rates have not varied over the Class II lifetime and that Auriga-Cal will maintain a lower star formation efficiency.},

  abstract    = {In the absence of direct accelerator data to constrain particle models, and given existing astrophysical uncertainties associated with the phase space distribution of WIMP dark matter in our galactic halo, extracting information on fundamental particle microphysics from possible signals in underground direct detectors will be challenging. Given these challenges we explore the requirements for direct detection of dark matter experiments to extract information on fundamental particle physics interactions. In particular, using Bayesian methods, we explore the quantitative distinctions that allow differentiation between different non-relativistic effective operators, as a function of the number of detected events, for a variety of possible operators that might generate the detected distribution. Without a spinless target one cannot distinguish between spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions. In general, of order 50 events would be required to definitively determine that the fundamental dark matter scattering amplitude is momentum independent, even in the optimistic case of minimal detector backgrounds and no inelastic scattering contributions. This bound can be improved with reduced uncertainties in the dark matter velocity distribution.},

  abstract    = {Context. From stars to active galactic nuclei, many astrophysical systems are surrounded by an equatorial distribution of dusty material that are, in a number of cases, spatially unresolved even with cutting edge facilities. Aims. In this paper, we investigate if and how one can determine the unresolved and heterogeneous morphology of dust distribution around a central bright source using time-resolved polarimetric observations. Methods. We use polarized radiative transfer simulations to study a sample of circumnuclear dusty morphologies. We explore a grid of uniform, fragmented, density-stratified, geometrically-variable models in the near-infrared, optical and ultraviolet bands, and present their distinctive time-dependent polarimetric signatures. Results. As expected, varying the structure of the obscuring equatorial disk has a deep impact on the inclination-dependent flux, polarization degree and angle, and time-lags we observe. We find that stratified media are distinguishable by time-resolved polarimetric observations, and that the expected polarization is much higher in the infrared band than in the ultraviolet. However, due to the physical scales imposed by dust sublimation, the average time-lags between the total and polarized fluxes are important (months to years), lengthening the observational campaigns necessary to break more sophisticated (and therefore also more degenerated) models. In the ultraviolet band, time-lags are slightly shorter than in the infrared or optical bands, and, coupled to lower diluting starlight fluxes, time-resolved polarimetry in the UV appears more promising for future campaigns.},

The metric coefficients depend on the asymmetric wormhole parameters, The coefficient of the linear potential is proportional to both the mass of the wormhole and the cosmological constant.

To continue to learn from these events it is necessary to robustly and systematically compare our growing number of observations with theory. We present a tidal disruption module for the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients (MOSFiT) and the results from fitting 14 tidal disruption events (TDEs). Our model uses FLASH simulations of TDEs to generate bolometric luminosities and passes these luminosities through viscosity and reprocessing transformation functions to create multi-wavelength light curves. It then uses an MCMC fitting routine to compare these theoretical light curves with observations. We find that none of the events show evidence for viscous delays exceeding a few days, supporting the theory that our current observing strategies in the optical/UV are missing a significant number of viscously delayed flares. We find that the events have black hole masses of $10^6 - 10^8 M_{\odot}$, and that the masses we predict are as reliable as those based on bulk galaxy properties. We also find that there is a preference for stars with mass $< 1 M_{\odot}$, as expected when low-mass stars greatly outnumber high-mass stars.},

In the past two decades, only a very few of these objects have been directly (or indirectly) observed towards high-mass (M > 8 M$_{\odot}$) young stellar objects, adding to the growing evidence that disk-mediated accretion is a phenomenon also occurring in high-mass stars, the formation mechanism of which is still poorly understood. Of the observed jets from massive young stars, none is in the optical regime (due to these being typically highly obscured by their native material), and none are found outside of the Milky Way. Here, we report the detection of HH 1177, the first extragalactic optical ionized jet originating from a massive young stellar object located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The jet is highly collimated over the entire measured extent of at least 10 pc, and has a bipolar geometry. The presence of a jet indicates ongoing, disk-mediated accretion, and together with the high degree of collimation, this system is therefore likely to be an up-scaled version of low-mass star formation. We conclude that the physics governing jet launching and collimation is independent of stellar mass.},

  abstract    = {This letter studies the formation of azimuthal metallicity variations in the disks of spiral galaxies in the absence of initial radial metallicity gradients. Using high-resolution $N$-body simulations, we model composite stellar discs, made of kinematically cold and hot stellar populations, and study their response to spiral arm perturbations. We find that, as expected, disk populations with different kinematics respond differently to a spiral perturbation, with the tendency for dynamically cooler populations to show a larger fractional contribution to spiral arms than dynamically hotter populations. By assuming a relation between kinematics and metallicity, namely the hotter the population, the more metal-poor it is, this differential response to the spiral arm perturbations naturally leads to azimuthal variations in the mean metallicity of stars in the simulated disk. Thus, azimuthal variations in the mean metallicity of stars across a spiral galaxy are not necessarily a consequence of the reshaping, by radial migration, of an initial radial metallicity gradient. They indeed arise naturally also in stellar disks which have initially only a negative vertical metallicity gradient.},

We calibrate predictions for cold neutral atomic and molecular gas using infrared dust emission and gas depletion time methods which are self-consistent and have ~20% accuracy (with the highest accuracy in the prediction of total cold gas mass). However, modest systematic residual dependences are found in all calibrations which depend on the partition between molecular and atomic gas, and can over/under-predict gas masses by up to 0.3dex. As expected, dust-based estimates are best at predicting the total gas mass while depletion time-based estimates are only able to predict the (star-forming) molecular gas mass. Additionally, we advise caution when applying these predictions to high-z galaxies, as significant (0.5dex or more) errors can arise when incorrect assumptions are made about the dominant gas phase. Any scaling relations derived using predicted gas masses may be more closely related to the calibrations used than to the actual galaxies observed.},

Most solutions are found in terms of special functions, such as associated Lagrange or hypergeometric functions. They may be considered exact in the sense that they are known to any desired accuracy in principle. The new aspect developed here is to present scale invariant solutions with zero resistivity that are self-similar in time. The time dependence is either a power law or an exponential factor, but since the geometry of the solution is self-similar in time we do not need to fix a time to study it. Several examples are discussed. Our results demonstrate (without the need to invoke any other mechanisms) X-shaped magnetic fields and (axially symmetric) magnetic spiral arms (both of which are well observed and documented) and predict reversing rotation measures in galaxy halos (now observed in the CHANG-ES sample) as well as the fact that planar magnetic spirals are lifted into the galactic halo.},

In all models the galactic disk is exponential and the halos are rigid or live Plummer spheres. More specifically, when there is no dark matter halo, we modify the gravitational force between point particles. To do so we use the weak field limit of an alternative theory of dark matter known as MOG in the literature. The galaxy model in MOG has the same initial conditions as in galaxy models with dark matter halo. On the other hand, the initial random velocities and the Toomre's local stability parameter are the same for all the models. We show that the evolution and growth of the bar in MOG is substantially different from the standard cases including dark matter halo. More importantly, we find that the bar growth rate and its final magnitude is smaller in MOG. On the other hand, the maximum value of the bar in MOG is smaller than the Newtonian models. It is shown that although the live dark matter halo may support the bar instability, MOG has stabilizing effects. Furthermore, we show that MOG supports fast pattern speeds, and unlike in the dark matter halo models pattern speed does not decrease with time. Theses differences, combined with the relevant observations, may help to distinguish between dark matter an modified gravity in galactic scales.},

We use Hubble Space Telescope observations of a region of moderate extinction and a region of high extinction to measure the optical and near-infrared extinction law (0.8 $\mu$m -- 2.2 $\mu$m). The moderate extinction region is the young massive cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd1; A$_{Ks} \sim$ 0.6 mag), where 453 proper motion-selected main-sequence stars are used to measure the shape of the extinction law. To quantify the shape we define the parameter $\mathcal{S}_{1/\lambda}$, which behaves similarly to a color excess ratio but is continuous as a function of wavelength. The high extinction region is the GC (A$_{Ks} \sim$ 2.5 mag), where 819 red clump stars are used to determine the normalization of the law. The best-fit extinction law is able to reproduce the Wd1 main sequence colors, which previous laws misestimate by 10%-30%. The law is inconsistent with a single power law, even when only the near-infrared filters are considered, and has A$_{F125W}$/A$_{Ks}$ and A$_{F814W}$/A$_{Ks}$ values that are 18% and 24% larger than the commonly used \citet{Nishiyama:2009fc} law, respectively. Using the law we recalculate the Wd1 distance to be 3896 $\pm$ 328 pc from published observations of eclipsing binary W13. This new extinction law should be used for highly reddened populations in the Milky Way, such as the Quintuplet cluster and Young Nuclear Cluster.

  abstract    = {Ultrafaint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) are typically assumed to have simple, stellar populations with star formation ending at reionization. Yet as the observations of these galaxies continue to improve, their star formation histories (SFHs) are revealed to be more complicated than previously thought. In this paper, we study how star formation, chemical enrichment, and mixing proceed in small, dark matter halos at early times using a high-resolution, cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation. The goals are to inform the future use of analytic models and to explore observable properties of the simulated halos in the context of UFD data. Specifically, we look at analytic approaches that might inform metal enrichment within and beyond small galaxies in the early Universe. We find that simple assumptions for modeling the extent of supernova-driven winds agree with the simulation on average whereas inhomogeneous mixing and gas flows have a large effect on the spread in simulated stellar metallicities. In the context of the UFDs, this work demonstrates that simulations can form halos with a complex SFH and a large spread in the metallicity distribution function within a few hundred Myr in the early Universe. In particular, bursty and continuous star formation are seen in the simulation and both scenarios have been argued from the data. Spreads in the simulated metallicities, however remain too narrow and too metal-rich when compared to the UFDs. Future work is needed to help reduce these discrepancies and advance our interpretation of the data.},

  abstract    = {Direct collapse within dark matter (DM) halos is a promising path to form supermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds at high redshifts. The outer part of this collapse remains optically thin, and has been studied intensively using numerical simulations. However, the innermost region of the collapse is expected to become optically thick and requires us to follow the radiation field in order to understand its subsequent evolution. So far, the adiabatic approximation has been used exclusively for this purpose. We apply radiative transfer in the flux-limited diffusion (FLD) approximation to solve the evolution of coupled gas and radiation, for isolated halos. For direct collapse within isolated DM halos, we find that (1) the photosphere forms at ~10^{-6} pc and rapidly expands outward. (2) A central core forms, with a mass of ~1 Mo, supported by thermal gas pressure gradients and rotation. (3) Growing thermal gas and radiation pressure gradients dissolve it. (4) This process is associated with a strong anisotropic outflow, and another core forms nearby and grows rapidly. (5) Typical radiation luminosity emerging from the photosphere encompassing these cores is ~5 x 10^{37}-5 x 10^{38} erg/s, of order the Eddington luminosity. (6) Two variability timescales are associated with this process: a long one, which is related to the accretion flow within the central ~10^{-4}-10^{-3} pc, and ~0.1 yr, which is related to radiation diffusion. (7) Adiabatic models have been run for comparison and their evolution differs profoundly from that of the FLD models, by forming a central geometrically-thick disk. Overall, an adiabatic equation of state is not a good approximation to the advanced stage of direct collapse, mainly because the radiation in the FLD is capable of escaping due to anisotropy in the optical depth and associated gradients.},

  title       = {Galaxy Zoo: Morphological classification of galaxy images from the Illustris simulation},
  abstract    = {Modern cosmological simulations model the universe with increasing sophistication and at higher spatial and temporal resolutions. These enhancements permit detailed comparisons between the simulation outputs and real observational data. Recent projects such as Illustris are capable of producing simulated images that are comparable to those obtained from local surveys. This paper tests how well Illustris achieves this goal across a diverse population of galaxies using visual morphologies derived from Galaxy Zoo citizen scientists. Morphological classifications provided by volunteers for simulated galaxies are compared with similar data for a compatible sample of images drawn from the SDSS Legacy Survey. This paper investigates how simple morphological characterization by human volunteers asked to distinguish smooth from featured systems differs between simulated and real galaxy images. Differences are identified, which are likely due to the limited resolution of the simulation, but which could be revealing real differences in the dynamical evolution of populations of galaxies in the real and model universes. Specifically, for stellar masses $M_{\star}\lesssim10^{11}M_{\odot}$, a larger proportion of Illustris galaxies that exhibit disk-like morphology or visible substructure, relative to their SDSS counterparts. Toward higher masses, simulated and observed galaxies converge and exhibit similar morphology distributions. The stellar mass threshold indicated by this divergent behavior confirms recent works using parametric measures of morphology from Illustris simulated images. When $M_{\star}\gtrsim10^{11}M_{\odot}$, the Illustris dataset contains fewer galaxies that classifiers regard as unambiguously featured. These results suggest that comparison between the detailed properties of observed and simulated galaxies, even when limited to reasonably massive systems, may be misleading.},

  abstract    = {Context: Recent near-infrared data have contributed to unveil massive and obscured stellar populations in both new and previously known clusters in our Galaxy. These discoveries lead us to view the Milky Way as an active star-forming machine. Aims: We look for young massive cluster candidates as over-densities of OB-type stars. The first search, focused on the Galactic direction $l=38^{\circ}$, resulted in the detection of two objects with a remarkable population of OB-type star candidates. Methods: With a modified version of the friends-of-friends algorithm AUTOPOP and using 2MASS and UKIDSS-GPS near-infrared ($J$, $H$, and $K$) photometry for one of our cluster candidates (named Masgomas-6) we selected 30 stars for multi-object and long-slit $H$- and $K$-spectroscopy. With the spectral classification and the near-infrared photometric data, we derive individual distance, extinction and radial velocity. Results: Of the 30 spectroscopically observed stars, 20 are classified as massive stars, including OB-types (dwarfs, giants and supergiants), two red supergiants, two Wolf-Rayet (WR122-11 and the new WR122-16), and one transitional object (the LBV candidate IRAS 18576+0341). The individual distances and radial velocities do not agree with a single cluster, indicating that we are observing two populations of massive stars in the same line-of-sight: Masgomas-6a and Masgomas-6b. The first group of massive stars, located at 3.9$^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ kpc, contains both Wolf-Rayets and most of the OB-dwarfs, and Masgomas-6b, at $9.6\pm0.4$ kpc, hosts the LBV candidate and an evolved population of supergiants. We are able to identify massive stars at two Galactic arms, but we can not clearly identify whether these massive stars form clusters or associations.},

This allows us to classify observations into singles, binaries, and trinaries, in a robust and efficient manner, without resorting to external models. We are able to identify multiple systems and, in some cases, make strong predictions for the properties of its unresolved stars. We will be able to compare such predictions with Gaia Data Release 4, which will contain astrometric identification and analysis of binary systems.},

  abstract    = {Within the mirror dark matter model and dissipative dark matter models in general, halos around galaxies with active star formation (including spirals and gas rich dwarfs) can be modelled as a fluid, which expands and contracts in response to heating and cooling processes. Ordinary Type II supernovae (SN) can provide the dominant heat source, possible if kinetic mixing interaction exists with strength $\epsilon \sim 10^{-9} - 10^{-10}$. The dark fluid around sufficiently isolated and unperturbed galaxies can potentially relax to a steady state configuration, where heating and cooling rates locally balance and hydrostatic equilibrium prevails. These steady state conditions can be solved to derive the physical properties, including the halo density and temperature profiles, for model galaxies. We have considered idealized spherically symmetric galaxies within the mirror dark particle model, as in the earlier paper [paper I, arXiv:1707.02528], but we have assumed that the local halo heating in the SN vicinity dominates over radiative sources. With this assumption, physically interesting steady state solutions arise which we compute for a representative range of model galaxies. The end result is a rather simple description of the dark matter halo around idealized spherically symmetric systems, characterized in principle by only 1 parameter, with physical properties that closely resemble the empirical properties of disk galaxies.},

  abstract    = {Usual explanations of spiral galaxy rotation curves assume circular orbits of stars. The consequences of giving up this assumption are investigated here. In particular, hyperbolic stellar trajectories are found to be interesting. The two suggested models for the production of such trajectories will also explain the observed flat rotation curves without the postulation of dark matter or MOND. It is suggested that spiral galaxies may have started as compact objects with significant angular momenta and then disintegrated. The first model conjectures the existence of a spinning hot disk around a spherical galactic core. The disk is held together by local gravity and electromagnetic scattering forces. However, it disintegrates at the edge producing fragments that form stars. Once separated from the disk, the stars experience only the centrally directed gravitational force due to the massive core and remaining disk. A numerical simulation shows that a high enough angular velocity of the disk produces hyperbolic stellar trajectories that agree with the observed rotation curves. The second model conjectures a significant initial thermonuclear event that produces a dust plume along with large stars. This dust plume is made of ordinary matter. However, it acts like the postulated dark matter in producing initial circular trajectories. Unlike dark matter, the plume can be shown to escape the galaxy rapidly causing the star trajectories to evolve to hyperbolic shapes. This process can be seen to produce the observed rotation curves due to the initial circular orbits. Also, as the plume dissipates rapidly it does not obfuscate the stars from view. Both models have weaknesses as do the currently known models using dark matter or MOND.},

  abstract    = {Using the two large cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, Horizon-AGN (H-AGN) and Horizon-noAGN (H-noAGN, no AGN feedback), we investigate how a typical sub-grid model for AGN feedback affects the evolution of the total density profiles (dark matter + stars) at the effective radius of massive early-type galaxies (M*>10^11 Msun). We have studied the dependencies of the mass-weighted density slope gamma'_tot with the effective radius, the galaxy mass and the host halo mass at z~0.3 and found that the inclusion of AGN feedbackalways leads to a much better agreement with observational values and trends. Our analysis suggests also that the inclusion of AGN feedback favours a strong correlation between gamma'_tot and the density slope of the dark matter component while, in the absence of AGN activity, gamma'_tot is rather strongly correlated with the density slope of the stellar component. Finally, we find that gamma'_tot derived from our samples of galaxies increases from z=2 to z=0,in good agreement with the expected observational trend. The derived slopes are slightly lower than in the data when AGN is included because the simulated galaxies tend to be too extended, especially the least massive ones. However, the simulated compact galaxies without AGN feedback have gamma'_tot values that are significantly too high compared to observations.},

  abstract    = {The increasing observational evidence of galactic outflows is considered as a sign of active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback in action. However, the physical mechanism responsible for driving the observed outflows remains unclear, and whether it is due to momentum, energy, or radiation is still a matter of debate. The observed outflow energetics, in particular the large measured values of the momentum ratio ($\dot{p}/(L/c) \sim 10$) and energy ratio ($\dot{E}_k/L \sim 0.05$), seems to favour the energy-driving mechanism; and most observational works have focused their comparison with wind energy-driven models. Here we show that AGN radiation pressure on dust can adequately reproduce the observed outflow energetics (mass outflow rate, momentum flux, and kinetic power), as well as the scalings with luminosity, provided that the effects of radiation trapping are properly taken into account. In particular, we predict a sub-linear scaling for the mass outflow rate ($\dot{M} \propto L^{1/2}$) and a super-linear scaling for the kinetic power ($\dot{E}_k \propto L^{3/2}$), in agreement with the observational scaling relations reported in the most recent compilation of AGN outflow data. We conclude that AGN radiative feedback can account for the global outflow energetics, at least equally well as the wind energy-driving mechanism, and therefore both physical models should be considered in the interpretation of future AGN outflow observations.},

While the observed $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\mathrm{Bulge}}$ correlation in bulge-dominated galaxies is thought to be produced by major mergers, the existence of a $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\star}$ relation, across all galaxy morphological types, suggests that BHs may be largely built by secular processes. Recent evidence that bulge-less galaxies, which are unlikely to have had significant mergers, are offset from the $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\mathrm{Bulge}}$ relation, but lie on the $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\star}$ relation, has strengthened this hypothesis. Nevertheless, the small size and heterogeneity of current datasets, coupled with the difficulty in measuring precise BH masses, makes it challenging to address this issue using empirical studies alone. Here, we use Horizon-AGN, a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to probe the role of mergers in BH growth over cosmic time. We show that (1) as suggested by observations, simulated bulge-less galaxies lie offset from the main $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\mathrm{Bulge}}$ relation, but on the $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\star}$ relation, (2) the positions of galaxies on the $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\star}$ relation are not affected by their merger histories and (3) only $\sim$35 per cent of the BH mass in today's massive galaxies is directly attributable to merging -- the majority ($\sim$65 per cent) of BH growth, therefore, takes place gradually, via secular processes, over cosmic time.},

We find typically intermediate to old ages (~7Gyr), low metallicities ([Z/H]~ -0.7dex) and slightly super-solar abundance patterns ([Mg/Fe] ~ +0.16dex). These properties are similar to those of dwarf galaxies inhabiting the same area in the cluster and are mostly consistent with being the continuity of the stellar mass scaling relations of more massive galaxies. These UDGs' star formation histories imply a relatively recent infall into the Coma cluster, consistent with the theoretical predictions for a dwarf-like origin. However, considering the scatter in the resulting properties and including other UDGs in Coma, together with the results from the velocity phase-space study of the Paper I in this series, a mixed-bag of origins is needed to explain the nature of all UDGs. Our results thus reinforce a scenario in which most of the UDGs are field dwarf galaxies that become quenched through their later infall in cluster environments, whereas some other UDGs are genuine primordial galaxies that failed to develop due to an early quenching phase. The unknown proportion of dwarf-like to primordial-like UDGs leaves the enigma of the nature of UDGs still open.},

Our models use updated values of the star formation rate density and dust attenuation in galaxies, QSO emissivity, and the distribution of H I gas in the IGM. Two of the most uncertain parameters in these models, the escape fraction of H I ionizing photons from galaxies and the spectral energy distribution (SED) of QSOs, are determined to be consistent with the latest measurements of H I and He II photoionization rates, the He II Lyman-alpha effective optical depths, various constraints on H I and He II reionization history and many measurements of the local EBL from soft X-rays till gamma-rays. We calculate the EBL from FIR to TeV gamma-rays by using FIR emissivities from our previous work and constructing an average SED of high-energy emitting QSOs, i.e, type-2 QSOs and blazars. For public use, we also provide the EBL models obtained using different QSO SEDs at extreme-UV energies over a wide range of redshifts. These can be used to quantify uncertainties in the parameters derived from photoionization models and numerical simulations originating from the allowed variations in the UV background radiation.},

  abstract    = {NGC7252, which is one of the nearest major-merger galaxy remnants, is an ideal laboratory to study the processes inherent to the transformation of disc galaxies to ellipticals as observed about ~1Gyr after the collision. We obtained wide-field IFU spectroscopy with the VLT-VIMOS integral-field spectrograph covering the central 50"x50" of NGC7252 to map the stellar and ionised gas kinematics, and the distribution and conditions of the ionised gas, revealing the extent of ongoing star formation and recent star formation history. We find that the inner gas disc is not counter-rotating with respect to the stars and that the stellar kinematics appear complex with a clear indication of a prolate-like rotation component suggesting a polar merger configuration. The ongoing star formation rate is 2.2+-0.6 M_sun/yr and implies a typical depletion time of 2Gyr given the molecular gas content. Furthermore, the spatially-resolved star formation history suggests a slight radial dependence, moving outwards at later times. We confirm a large AGN-ionised gas cloud previously discovered 5kpc south of the nucleus, and find higher ionisation also at the galaxy centre relative to the surrounding gas disc. Although the higher ionisation towards the centre is potentially degenerate within the central star forming ring, it may be associated with a low-luminosity AGN. Although NGC7252 has been classified as post-starburst galaxy at the centre, the elliptical-like major-merger remnant still appears very active. A central kpc-scale gas disc has presumably re-formed quickly within the last 100Myr after final coalescence. The disc features ongoing star formation, implying Gyr long timescale to reach the red sequence through gas consumption alone. While NGC7252 is useful to probe the transformation from discs to ellipticals, it is not well-suited to study the transformation from blue to red at this point.},

  title       = {UV SEDs of early-type cluster galaxies: A new look at the UV upturn},
  abstract    = {Using GALEX, UVOT and optical photometry, we explore the prevalence and strength of the UV-upturn in the spectra of quiescent early type galaxies in several nearby clusters. Even for galaxies with completely passive optical colours, there is a large spread in vacuum UV colour consistent with almost all having some UV upturn component. Combining GALEX and UVOT data below 3000\AA, we generate for the first time comparatively detailed UV SEDs for Coma cluster galaxies. Fitting the UV upturn component with a blackbody, twenty six of these show a range of characteristic temperatures (10000--21000K) for the UV upturn population. Assuming a single temperature to explain GALEX-optical colours could underestimate the fraction of galaxies with UV upturns and mis-classify some as systems with residual star formation. The UV upturn phenomenon is not an exclusive feature found only in giant galaxies; we identify galaxies with similar (or even bluer) $FUV-V$ colours to the giants with upturns over a range of fainter luminosities. The temperature and strength of the UV upturn are correlated with galaxy mass. Under the plausible hypothesis that the sources of the UV upturn are blue horizontal branch stars, the most likely mechanism for this is the presence of a substantial (between 4\% and 20\%) Helium rich ($Y > 0.3$) population of stars in these galaxies, potentially formed at $z\sim 4$ and certainly at $z>2$; this plausibly sets a lower limit of $\sim {\rm 0.3 - 0.8} \times 10^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$ to the {\it in situ} stellar mass of $\sim L^*$ galaxies at this redshift.},

  abstract    = {We present optical continuum lags for two Seyfert 1 galaxies, MCG+08-11-011 and NGC 2617, using monitoring data from a reverberation mapping campaign carried out in 2014. Our light curves span the ugriz filters over four months, with median cadences of 1.0 and 0.6 days for MCG+08-11-011 and NGC\,2617, respectively, combined with roughly daily X-ray and near-UV data from Swift for NGC 2617. We find lags consistent with geometrically thin accretion-disk models that predict a lag-wavelength relation of $\tau \propto \lambda^{4/3}$. However, the observed lags are larger than predictions based on standard thin-disk theory by factors of 3.3 for MCG+08-11-011 and 2.3 for NGC\,2617. These differences can be explained if the mass accretion rates are larger than inferred from the optical luminosity by a factor of 4.3 in MCG+08-11-011 and a factor of 1.3 in NGC\,2617, although uncertainty in the SMBH masses determines the significance of this result. While the X-ray variability in NGC\,2617 precedes the UV/optical variability, the long 2.6 day lag is problematic for coronal reprocessing models.},

We also identify a new cluster background UDG. In this pilot study of Coma UDGs in velocity phase-space, we find evidence that most present-day Coma UDGs have a recent infall epoch while a few may be ancient infalls. These recent infall UDGs have higher absolute relative line-of-sight velocities, bluer optical colors, and are smaller in size, unlike the ancient infalls. The kinematics of the spectroscopically confirmed Coma UDG sample is similar to that of the cluster late-type galaxy population. Our velocity phase-space analysis suggests that present-day cluster UDGs have a predominantly accretion origin from the field, acquire velocities corresponding to the mass of the cluster at accretion as they are accelerated towards the cluster center, and become redder and bigger as they experience the various physical processes at work within the cluster.},

  abstract    = {The Virgo Environmental Survey Tracing Ionised Gas Emission (VESTIGE) is a blind narrow-band H$\alpha$+[NII] imaging survey carried out with MegaCam at the CFHT. During pilot observations we have observed NGC 4330, an intermediate mass, edge-on star forming spiral currently falling into the core of the Virgo cluster. New deep observations revealed a low surface brightness 10 kpc tail exhibiting a peculiar filamentary structure. The filaments are remarkably parallel one another and clearly indicate the direction of motion of the galaxy in the Virgo potential. Motivated by the detection of these features, indicating ongoing gas stripping, we collected literature photometry in 15 bands from the far-UV to the far-IR and deep optical long slit spectroscopy using the FORS2 instrument at the ESO Very Large Telescope. Using a newly developed Monte Carlo code that jointly fits spectroscopy and photometry, we reconstructed the star formation histories in apertures along the major axis of the galaxy. Our results have been validated against the output of CIGALE, a fitting code which has been previously used for similar studies. We found a clear outside-in gradient with radius of the time when the quenching event started: the outermost radii have been stripped 500 Myr ago, while the stripping has reached the inner 5 kpc from the center in the last 100 Myr. Regions at even smaller radii are currently still forming stars fueled by the presence of HI and H2 gas. When compared to statistical studies of the quenching timescales in the local Universe we find that ram pressure stripping of the cold gas is an effective mechanism to reduce the transformation times for galaxies falling into massive clusters. Future systematic studies of all the active galaxies observed by VESTIGE in the Virgo cluster will extend these results to a robust statistical framework.},

  abstract    = {We employ isolated N-body simulations to study the response of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos in the presence of the baryonic potentials. Dark matter self-interactions lead to kinematic thermalization in the inner halo, resulting in a tight correlation between the dark matter and baryon distributions. A deep baryonic potential shortens the phase of SIDM core expansion and triggers core contraction. This effect can be further enhanced by a large self-scattering cross section. We find the final SIDM density profile is sensitive to the baryonic concentration and the strength of dark matter self-interactions. Assuming a spherical initial halo, we also study evolution of the SIDM halo shape together with the density profile. The halo shape at later epochs deviates from spherical symmetry due to the influence of the non-spherical disk potential, and its significance depends on the baryonic contribution to the total gravitational potential, relative to the dark matter one. In addition, we construct a multi-component model for the Milky Way, including an SIDM halo, a stellar disk and a bulge, and show it is consistent with observations from stellar kinematics and streams.},

  abstract    = {Observations of the 21 cm line from neutral hydrogen indicate that an Epoch of Heating (EoH) might have preceded the later Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Here we study the effects on the ionization state and the thermal history of the Intergalactic Medium (IGM) during the EoH induced by different assumptions on ionizing sources in the high redshift Universe: (i) stars, (ii) X-ray binaries (XRBs), (iii) thermal bremsstrahlung of the hot Interstellar Medium (ISM), and (iv) accreting nuclear black holes (BHs). To this aim, we post-process outputs from the ($100 h^{-1}$ cMpc)$^3$ hydrodynamical simulation MassiveBlack-II with the cosmological 3D radiative transfer code CRASH, which follows the propagation of UV and X-ray photons, computing the thermal and ionization state of hydrogen and helium through the EoH. We find that stars determine the fully ionized morphology of the IGM, while the spectrally hard XRBs pave way for efficient subsequent heating and ionization by the spectrally softer ISM. With the seeding prescription in MassiveBlack-II, BHs do not contribute significantly to either ionization or heating. With only stars, most of the IGM remains in a cold state (with a median $T=11$ K at $z=10$), however, the presence of more energetic sources raises the temperature of regions around the brightest and more clustered sources above that of the CMB, opening the possibility to observing the 21 cm signal in emission.},

  title       = {Numerical Calibration of the HCN$-$Star Formation Correlation},
  abstract    = {HCN(1$-$0) emission traces dense gas and correlates very strongly with star formation rates (SFRs) on scales from small Milky Way clouds to whole galaxies. The observed correlation offers strong constraints on the efficiency of star formation in dense gas, but quantitative interpretation of this constraint requires a mapping from HCN emission to gas mass and density. In this paper we provide the required calibration by postprocessing high-resolution simulations of dense, star-forming clouds to calculate their HCN emission ($L_{\rm HCN}$) and to determine how that emission is related to the underlying gas density distribution and star formation efficiency. We find that HCN emission traces gas with a luminosity-weighted mean number density of $0.8-1.7 \times 10^4\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$ and that HCN luminosity is related to mass of dense gas of $\gtrsim 10^4\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$ with a conversion factor of ${\alpha}_{\rm HCN} \approx 14\,\rm M_{\odot}/(K\,km\,s^{-1}\,{pc}^2)$. We also measure a new empirical relationship between the star formation rate per global mean freefall time (${\epsilon}_{ff}$) and the SFR$-$HCN relationship, ${\rm SFR}/L_{\rm HCN} = 5.73 \times 10^{-5}\,{\epsilon}^{1.32}_{\rm ff}\,\rm M_{\odot}\,{yr}^{-1}/(K\,km\,s^{-1}\,{pc}^2)$. The observed SFR$-$HCN correlation strongly constrains ${\epsilon}_{\rm ff} \approx 1\%$ with a factor of $\sim 2$ systematic uncertainty. The scatter in ${\epsilon}_{\rm ff}$ from cloud to cloud within the Milky Way is a factor of a few. We conclude that $L_{\rm HCN}$ is an effective tracer of dense gas and that the IR$-$HCN correlation is a very strong diagnostic of the microphysics of star formation in dense gas.},

We find that signal to noise ratio per pixel around 20 (5) allow a statistical accuracy on $\log_{10}(M^{*}/M_{\odot})$ of 0.2 (0.4) dex, for the Chabrier IMF.

Galaxy Evolution Explorer UV data are used to cleanly divide the sample into star-forming and quenched galaxies and to identify galaxies in transition (the green valley). Despite a stark difference in visual appearance between blue and red galaxies, their average radial stellar mass density profiles are remarkably similar (especially in the outer regions) at fixed mass. The inner stellar mass surface density within a radius of 1 kpc, Σ 1 , is used to quantify the growth of the bulge as galaxies evolve. When galaxies are divided into narrow mass bins, their distribution in the color-Σ 1 plane at fixed mass forms plausible evolutionary tracks. Σ 1 seems to grow as galaxies evolve through the blue cloud, and once it crosses a threshold value, galaxies are seen to quench at fixed Σ 1 . The Σ 1 threshold for quenching grows with stellar mass, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/776/1/63/apj484827ieqn1.gif] {$\Sigma _1\propto M_*^{0.64}$} . However, the existence of some star-forming galaxies above the threshold Σ 1 implies that a dense bulge is necessary but not sufficient to quench a galaxy fully. This would be consistent with a two-step quenching process in which gas within a galaxy is removed or stabilized against star formation by bulge-driven processes (such as a starburst, active galactic nucleus feedback, or morphological quenching), whereas external gas accretion is suppressed by separate halo-driven processes (such as halo gas shock heating). Quenching thus depends on an interplay between the inner structure of a galaxy and its surrounding dark matter halo, and lack of perfect synchrony between the two could produce the observed scatter in color versus Σ 1 .},

We report on a sample of extreme emission line galaxies at $z\lesssim0.05$ (blueberry galaxies). We selected them from SDSS broadband images on the basis of their broad band colors, and studied their properties with MMT spectroscopy. From the whole SDSS DR12 photometric catalog, we found 51 photometric candidates. We spectroscopically confirm 40 as blueberry galaxies.

These blueberries are dwarf starburst galaxies with very small sizes ($< 1\hbox{kpc}$), and very high ionization ([OIII]/[OII]$\sim10-60$).

  abstract    = {We search for massive and compact galaxies (superdense galaxies, hereafter SDGs) at z=0.03-0.11 in the Padova-Millennium Galaxy and Group Catalogue, a spectroscopically complete sample representative of the local Universe general field population. We find that compact galaxies with radii and mass densities comparable to high-z massive and passive galaxies represent 4.4% of all galaxies with stellar masses above 3 X 10^10 M_sun, yielding a number density of 4.3 X 10^-4 h^3 Mpc^-3. Most of them are S0s (70%) or ellipticals (23%), are red and have intermediate-to-old stellar populations, with a median luminosity-weighted age of 5.4 Gyr and a median mass-weighted age of 9.2 Gyr. Their velocity dispersions and dynamical masses are consistent with the small radii and high stellar mass estimates. Comparing with the WINGS sample of cluster galaxies at similar redshifts, the fraction of superdense galaxies is three times smaller in the field than in clusters, and cluster SDGs are on average 4 Gyr older than field SDGs. We confirm the existence of a universal trend of smaller radii for older luminosity-weighted ages at fixed galaxy mass. On top of the well known dependence of stellar age on galaxy mass, the luminosity-weighted age of galaxies depends on galaxy compactness at fixed mass, and, for a fixed mass and radius, on environment. This effect needs to be taken into account in order not to overestimate the evolution of galaxy sizes from high- to low-z. Our results and hierarchical simulations suggest that a significant fraction of the massive compact galaxies at high-z have evolved into compact galaxies in galaxy clusters today. When stellar age and environmental effects are taken into account, the average amount of size evolution of individual galaxies between high- and low-z is mild, a factor ~1.6. (abridged)},

  abstract    = {The extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) is one of the first of a new generation of galaxy redshift surveys that will cover a large range in redshift with sufficient resolution to measure the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) signal. For surveys covering a large redshift range we can no longer ignore cosmological evolution, meaning that either the redshift shells analysed have to be significantly narrower than the survey, or we have to allow for the averaging over evolving quantities. Both of these have the potential to remove signal: analysing small volumes increases the size of the Fourier window function, reducing the large-scale information, while averaging over evolving quantities can, if not performed carefully, remove differential information. It will be important to measure cosmological evolution from these surveys to explore and discriminate between models. We apply a method to optimally extract this differential information to mock catalogues designed to mimic the eBOSS quasar sample. By applying a set of weights to extract redshift space distortion measurements as a function of redshift, we demonstrate an analysis that does not invoke the problems discussed above. We show that our estimator gives unbiased constraints.},

  abstract = {In a six-year program started in 2014 July, the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) will conduct novel cosmological observations using the BOSS spectrograph at Apache Point Observatory. These observations will be conducted simultaneously with the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS) designed for variability studies and the Spectroscopic Identification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS) program designed for studies of X-ray sources. In particular, eBOSS will measure with percent-level precision the distance-redshift relation with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of matter. eBOSS will use four different tracers of the underlying matter density field to vastly expand the volume covered by BOSS and map the large-scale-structures over the relatively unconstrained redshift range0.6 < z < 2.2. Using more than 250,000 new, spectroscopically confirmed luminous red galaxies at a median redshift z = 0.72, we project that eBOSS will yield measurements of the angular diameter distance d A ( z ) to an accuracy of 1.2% and measurements of H ( z ) to 2.1% when combined with the z > 0.6 sample of BOSS galaxies. With ∼195,000 new emission line galaxy redshifts, we expect BAO measurements of d A ( z ) to an accuracy of 3.1% and H ( z ) to 4.7% at an effective redshift of z = 0.87. A sample of more than 500,000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars will provide the first BAO distance measurements over the redshift range0.9 < z < 2.2, with expected precision of 2.8% and 4.2% on d A ( z ) and H ( z ), respectively. Finally, with 60,000 new quasars and re-observation of 60,000 BOSS quasars, we will obtain new Ly α forest measurements at redshifts z > 2.1; these new data will enhance the precision of d A ( z ) and H ( z ) at z > 2.1 by a factor of 1.44 relative to BOSS. Furthermore, eBOSS will provide improved tests of General Relativity on cosmological scales through redshift-space distortion measurements, improved tests for non-Gaussianity in the primordial density field, and new constraints on the summed mass of all neutrino species. Here, we provide an overview of the cosmological goals, spectroscopic target sample, demonstration of spectral quality from early data, and projected cosmological constraints from eBOSS.},

To test different ELG selection algorithms, 9000 spectra were observed with the SDSS spectrograph as a pilot survey based on data from several imaging surveys. First, using visual inspection and redshift quality flags, we show that the automated spectroscopic redshifts assigned by the pipeline meet the quality requirements for a reliable BAO measurement. We also show the correlations between sky emission, signal-to-noise ratio in the emission lines, and redshift error. Then we provide a detailed description of each target selection algorithm we tested and compare them with the requirements of the eBOSS experiment. As a result, we provide reliable redshift distributions for the different target selection schemes we tested. Finally, we determine an target selection algorithms that is best suited to be applied on DECam photometry because they fulfill the eBOSS survey efficiency requirements.

The catalogues were obtained using a Fisher discriminant technique described in a companion paper. The two catalogues differ by the imaging used to define the Fisher discriminant: the first catalogue includes imaging from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the second also includes information from the South Galactic Cap U-band Sky Survey. Containing respectively 560 045 and 615 601 objects, they represent the largest ELG catalogues available today and were designed for the ELG programme of the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). We study potential sources of systematic variation in the angular distribution of the selected ELGs due to fluctuations of the observational parameters. We model the influence of the observational parameters using a multivariate regression and implement a weighting scheme which allows effective removal of all of the systematic errors induced by the observational parameters. We show that fluctuations in the imaging zero-points of the photometric bands have minor impact on the angular distribution of objects in our catalogues. We compute the angular clustering of both catalogues and show that our weighting procedure effectively removes spurious clustering on large scales. We fit a model to the small-scale angular clustering, showing that the selections have similar biases of 1.35/D$_{a}$(z) and 1.28/D$_{a}$(z). Both catalogues are publicly available.},

  abstract      = {We describe the algorithm used to select the emission line galaxy (ELG) sample at z {\tilde} 0.85 for the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV, using photometric data from the DECam Legacy Survey. Our selection is based on a selection box in the g - r versus r - z colour-colour space and a cut on the g-band magnitude, to favour galaxies in the desired redshift range with strong [O II] emission. It provides a target density of 200 deg$^{-2}$ on the North Galactic Cap and of 240 deg$^{-2}$ on the South Galactic Cap (SGC), where we use a larger selection box because of deeper imaging. We demonstrate that this selection passes the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey requirements in terms of homogeneity. About 50 000 ELGs have been observed since the observations have started in 2016, September. These roughly match the expected redshift distribution, though the measured efficiency is slightly lower than expected. The efficiency can be increased by enlarging the redshift range and with incoming pipeline improvement. The cosmological forecast based on these first data predict {$\sigma$} \_$\{$D\_V$\}$/D\_V = 0.023, in agreement with previous forecasts. Lastly, we present the stellar population properties of the ELG SGC sample. Once observations are completed, this sample will be suited to provide a cosmological analysis at z {\tilde} 0.85, and will pave the way for the next decade of massive spectroscopic cosmological surveys, which heavily rely on ELGs. The target catalogue over the SGC will be released along with DR14.},

  abstract  = {We investigate the environmental quenching of galaxies, especially those with stellar masses (M*) smaller than 10\^{}9.5 M{\sun}, beyond the local universe. Essentially all local low-mass quenched galaxies (QGs) are believed to live close to massive central galaxies, which is a demonstration of environmental quenching. We use CANDELS data to test whether or not such a dwarf QG--massive central galaxy connection exists beyond the local universe. For this purpose, we only need a statistically representative, rather than a complete, sample of low-mass galaxies, which enables our study out to z $\gt$ 1.5. For each low-mass galaxy, we measure the projected distance (dproj) to its nearest massive (M* $\gt$ 10\^{}10.5 M{\sun}) neighbor within a redshift range. At a given z and M*, the environmental quenching effect is considered to be observed if the dproj distribution of QGs is significantly skewed toward lower values than that of star-forming galaxies (SFGs). For galaxies with 10\^{}8 M{\sun} $\lt$ M* $\lt$ 10\^{}10 M{\sun}, such a difference between the dproj distributions of quenched and star-forming populations is detected up to z {\tilde} 1. Also, about 10\% of the quenched galaxies in our sample are located between two and four virial radii (R\_Vir) of the massive halos. The median projected distance from low-mass QGs to their massive neighbors (dproj/R\_Vir) decreases with satellite M* at M* $\lt$ 10\^{}9.5 M{\sun}, but increases with satellite M* at M* $\gt$ 10\^{}9.5 M{\sun}. This trend suggests a smooth, if any, transition of the quenching timescale around M* of 10\^{}9.5 M{\sun} at 0.5 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1.0.},

  title       = {Evidence for Merger-Driven Growth in Luminous, High-z, Obscured AGN in the CANDELS/COSMOS Field},
  abstract    = {While major mergers have long been proposed as a driver of both AGN activity and the M-sigma relation, studies of moderate to high redshift Seyfert-luminosity AGN hosts have found little evidence for enhanced rates of interactions. However, both theory and observation suggest that while these AGN may be fueled by stochastic accretion and secular processes, high-luminosity, high-redshift, and heavily obscured AGN are the AGN most likely to be merger-driven. To better sample this population of AGN, we turn to infrared selection in the CANDELS/COSMOS field. Compared to their lower-luminosity and less obscured X-ray-only counterparts, IR-only AGN (luminous, heavily obscured AGN) are more likely to be classified as either irregular (50$^{+12}_{-12}$% vs. 9$^{+5}_{-2}$%) or asymmetric (69$^{+9}_{-13}$% vs. 17$^{+6}_{-4}$%) and are less likely to have a spheroidal component (31$^{+13}_{-9}$% vs. 77$^{+4}_{-6}$%). Furthermore, IR-only AGN are also significantly more likely than X-ray-only AGN (75$^{+8}_{-13}$% vs. 31$^{+6}_{-6}$%) to be classified either as interacting or merging in a way that significantly disturbs the host galaxy or disturbed though not clearly interacting or merging, which potentially represents the late stages of a major merger. This suggests that while major mergers may not contribute significantly to the fueling of Seyfert luminosity AGN, interactions appear to play a more dominant role in the triggering and fueling of high-luminosity heavily obscured AGN.},

  title       = {Clumpy Galaxies in CANDELS. II. Physical Properties of UV-bright Clumps at $0.5\leq z<3$},
  abstract    = {Studying giant star-forming clumps in distant galaxies is important to understand galaxy formation and evolution. At present, however, observers and theorists have not reached a consensus on whether the observed "clumps" in distant galaxies are the same phenomenon that is seen in simulations. In this paper, as a step to establish a benchmark of direct comparisons between observations and theories, we publish a sample of clumps constructed to represent the commonly observed "clumps" in the literature. This sample contains 3193 clumps detected from 1270 galaxies at $0.5 \leq z < 3.0$. The clumps are detected from rest-frame UV images, as described in our previous paper. Their physical properties, e.g., rest-frame color, stellar mass (M*), star formation rate (SFR), age, and dust extinction, are measured by fitting the spectral energy distribution (SED) to synthetic stellar population models. We carefully test the procedures of measuring clump properties, especially the method of subtracting background fluxes from the diffuse component of galaxies. With our fiducial background subtraction, we find a radial clump U-V color variation, where clumps close to galactic centers are redder than those in outskirts. The slope of the color gradient (clump color as a function of their galactocentric distance scaled by the semi-major axis of galaxies) changes with redshift and M* of the host galaxies: at a fixed M*, the slope becomes steeper toward low redshift, and at a fixed redshift, it becomes slightly steeper with M*. Based on our SED-fitting, this observed color gradient can be explained by a combination of a negative age gradient, a negative E(B-V) gradient, and a positive specific star formation rate gradient of the clumps. We also find that the color gradients of clumps are steeper than those of intra-clump regions. [Abridged]},

  abstract    = {We studied Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) escape in a statistical sample of 43 Green Peas with HST/COS Ly$\alpha$ spectra. Green Peas are nearby star-forming galaxies with strong [OIII]$\lambda$5007 emission lines. Our sample is four times larger than the previous sample and covers a much more complete range of Green Pea properties. We found that about 2/3 of Green Peas are strong Ly$\alpha$ line emitters with rest-frame Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width $>20$ \AA. The Ly$\alpha$ profiles of Green Peas are diverse. The Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction, defined as the ratio of observed Ly$\alpha$ flux to intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ flux, shows anti-correlations with a few Ly$\alpha$ kinematic features -- both the blue peak and red peak velocities, the peak separations, and FWHM of the red portion of the Ly$\alpha$ profile. Using properties measured from SDSS optical spectra, we found many correlations -- Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction generally increases at lower dust reddening, lower metallicity, lower stellar mass, and higher [OIII]/[OII] ratio. We fit their Ly$\alpha$ profiles with the HI shell radiative transfer model and found Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction anti-correlates with the best-fit $N_{HI}$. Finally, we fit an empirical linear relation to predict Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction from the dust extinction and Ly$\alpha$ red peak velocity. The standard deviation of this relation is about 0.3 dex. This relation can be used to isolate the effect of IGM scatterings from Ly$\alpha$ escape and to probe the IGM optical depth along the line of sight of each $z>7$ Ly$\alpha$ emission line galaxy in the JWST era.},

  title       = {The Eleventh and Twelfth Data Releases of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: Final Data from SDSS-III},
  abstract    = {The third generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III) took data from 2008 to 2014 using the original SDSS wide-field imager, the original and an upgraded multi-object fiber-fed optical spectrograph, a new near-infrared high-resolution spectrograph, and a novel optical interferometer. All the data from SDSS-III are now made public. In particular, this paper describes Data Release 11 (DR11) including all data acquired through 2013 July, and Data Release 12 (DR12) adding data acquired through 2014 July (including all data included in previous data releases), marking the end of SDSS-III observing. Relative to our previous public release (DR10), DR12 adds one million new spectra of galaxies and quasars from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) over an additional 3000 sq. deg of sky, more than triples the number of H-band spectra of stars as part of the Apache Point Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), and includes repeated accurate radial velocity measurements of 5500 stars from the Multi-Object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanet Large-area Survey (MARVELS). The APOGEE outputs now include measured abundances of 15 different elements for each star. In total, SDSS-III added 2350 sq. deg of ugriz imaging; 155,520 spectra of 138,099 stars as part of the Sloan Exploration of Galactic Understanding and Evolution 2 (SEGUE-2) survey; 2,497,484 BOSS spectra of 1,372,737 galaxies, 294,512 quasars, and 247,216 stars over 9376 sq. deg; 618,080 APOGEE spectra of 156,593 stars; and 197,040 MARVELS spectra of 5,513 stars. Since its first light in 1998, SDSS has imaged over 1/3 of the Celestial sphere in five bands and obtained over five million astronomical spectra.},

  title       = {The Fourteenth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: First Spectroscopic Data from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey and from the second phase of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment},
  abstract    = {The fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) has been in operation since July 2014. This paper describes the second data release from this phase, and the fourteenth from SDSS overall (making this, Data Release Fourteen or DR14). This release makes public data taken by SDSS-IV in its first two years of operation (July 2014-2016). Like all previous SDSS releases, DR14 is cumulative, including the most recent reductions and calibrations of all data taken by SDSS since the first phase began operations in 2000. New in DR14 is the first public release of data from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS); the first data from the second phase of the Apache Point Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-2), including stellar parameter estimates from an innovative data driven machine learning algorithm known as "The Cannon"; and almost twice as many data cubes from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey as were in the previous release (N = 2812 in total). This paper describes the location and format of the publicly available data from SDSS-IV surveys. We provide references to the important technical papers describing how these data have been taken (both targeting and observation details) and processed for scientific use. The SDSS website (www.sdss.org) has been updated for this release, and provides links to data downloads, as well as tutorials and examples of data use. SDSS-IV is planning to continue to collect astronomical data until 2020, and will be followed by SDSS-V.},

  title       = {The SDSS-IV extended Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey: Luminous Red Galaxy Target Selection},

LRG targets are required to meet a set of color selection criteria and have z-band and i-band MODEL magnitudes z < 19.95 and 19.9 < i < 21.8, respectively. Our algorithm selects roughly 50 LRG targets per square degree, the great majority of which lie in the redshift range 0.6 < z < 1.0 (median redshift 0.71). We demonstrate that our methods are highly effective at eliminating stellar contamination and lower-redshift galaxies. We perform a number of tests using spectroscopic data from SDSS-III/BOSS to determine the redshift reliability of our target selection and its ability to meet the science requirements of eBOSS. The SDSS spectra are of high enough signal-to-noise ratio that at least 89% of the target sample yields secure redshift measurements. We also present tests of the uniformity and homogeneity of the sample, demonstrating that it should be clean enough for studies of the large-scale structure of the universe at higher redshifts than SDSS-III/BOSS LRGs reached.},

We explore this technique using a combination of optical photometry from CFHTLS and Hubble Space Telescope , infrared photometry from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer satellite, and spectroscopic or photometric redshifts from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey or COSMOS. We present a variety of methods for testing the success of our selection and present methods for optimization given a set of rest-frame color and redshift requirements. We have tested this selection in two different regions of the sky, the COSMOS and Extended Groth Strip (EGS) fields, to reduce the effect of cosmic/sample variance. We have used these methods to assemble large samples of LRGs for two different ancillary programs as a part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-III/Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. This technique is now being used to select ∼600,000 LRG targets for SDSS-IV/Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, which began observations in Fall 2014, and will be adapted for the proposed Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey. We have found that these methods can select high-redshift LRGs efficiently with minimal stellar contamination; this is extremely difficult to achieve with selections that rely on optical photometry alone.},

  abstract    = {The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) is designed to measure the scale of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of matter over a larger volume than the combined efforts of all previous spectroscopic surveys of large scale structure. BOSS uses 1.5 million luminous galaxies as faint as i=19.9 over 10,000 square degrees to measure BAO to redshifts z<0.7. Observations of neutral hydrogen in the Lyman alpha forest in more than 150,000 quasar spectra (g<22) will constrain BAO over the redshift range 2.15<z<3.5. Early results from BOSS include the first detection of the large-scale three-dimensional clustering of the Lyman alpha forest and a strong detection from the Data Release 9 data set of the BAO in the clustering of massive galaxies at an effective redshift z = 0.57. We project that BOSS will yield measurements of the angular diameter distance D_A to an accuracy of 1.0% at redshifts z=0.3 and z=0.57 and measurements of H(z) to 1.8% and 1.7% at the same redshifts. Forecasts for Lyman alpha forest constraints predict a measurement of an overall dilation factor that scales the highly degenerate D_A(z) and H^{-1}(z) parameters to an accuracy of 1.9% at z~2.5 when the survey is complete. Here, we provide an overview of the selection of spectroscopic targets, planning of observations, and analysis of data and data quality of BOSS.},

Key to analysing the clustering of these data to provide cosmological measurements is understanding the detailed properties of this sample. Potential issues include variations in the target catalogue caused by changes either in the targeting algorithm or properties of the data used, the pattern of spectroscopic observations, the spatial distribution of targets for which redshifts were not obtained, and variations in the target sky density due to observational systematics. We document here the target selection algorithms used to create the galaxy samples that comprise BOSS. We also present the algorithms used to create large scale structure catalogues for the final Data Release (DR12) samples and the associated random catalogues that quantify the survey mask. The algorithms are an evolution of those used by the BOSS team to construct catalogues from earlier data, and have been designed to accurately quantify the galaxy sample.

We have identified galaxies which may be BCDs during quiescence (QBCD), i.e., before the characteristic starburst sets in or when it has faded away. These QBCD galaxies are assumed to be like the BCD host galaxies. The SDSS DR6 database provides ~21,500 QBCD candidates. We also select from SDSS DR6 a complete sample of BCD galaxies to serve as reference. The properties of these two galaxy sets have been computed and compared. The QBCD candidates are 30 times more abundant than the BCDs, with their luminosity functions being very similar except for the scaling factor and the expected luminosity dimming associated with the end of the starburst. QBCDs are redder than BCDs, and they have larger H II region-based oxygen abundance. QBCDs also have lower surface brightness. The BCD candidates turn out to be the QBCD candidates with the largest specific star formation rate (actually, with the largest Hα equivalent width). One out of every three dwarf galaxies in the local universe may be a QBCD. The properties of the selected BCDs and QBCDs are consistent with a single sequence in galactic evolution, which the quiescent phase lasting 30 times longer than the starburst phase. The resulting time-averaged star formation rate is low enough to allow this cadence of BCD-QBCD phases during the Hubble time.},

With this sample, we obtain the median colour-z relations based on 7400 quasars with magnitude uncertainties less than 0.1 mag in all bands. By analysing the quasar colours, we propose an empirical criterion in the Y-K versus g-z colour-colour diagram to separate stars and quasars with redshift z $\lt$ 4, and two other criteria for selecting high-redshift quasars. Using the SDSS-UKIDSS colour-z relations, we estimate the photometric redshifts of 8498 SDSS-UKIDSS quasars, and find that 85.0 per cent of them are consistent with the spectroscopic redshifts within |{$\Delta$}z| $\lt$ 0.2, which leads to a significant increase of the photometric redshift accuracy from that based on the SDSS colour-z relations only. As two tests, we compare our colour-selection criterion with a small UKIDSS/EDR quasar/star sample and a sample of 4671 variable sources in the SDSS Stripe 82 region with both SDSS and UKIDSS data. We find that they can be clearly divided into two classes (quasars and stars) by our criterion in the Y-K versus g-z plot. We select 3834 quasar candidates from the variable sources with g $\lt$ 20.5 in Stripe 82, 826 of them being SDSS quasars and the rest without SDSS spectroscopy. We estimate the photometric redshifts for 3519 quasar candidates with all UKIDSS YJHK data and find an accuracy of 87.5 per cent within |{$\Delta$}z| $\lt$ 0.2 with the spectroscopic redshifts of 819 SDSS-UKIDSS identified quasars among them. We demonstrate that even at the same spectroscopy limit as SDSS, with our criterion we can at least partially recover the missing quasars with z{\tilde} 2.7 in SDSS. The SDSS-identified quasars only take a small fraction (21.5 per cent) of our quasar candidates selected from the variable sources in Stripe 82, indicating that deeper spectroscopy is very promising in producing a much larger sample of quasars than SDSS. The implications of our current results for the future Chinese Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) quasar survey are also discussed.},

  abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m$\gt$\~{}1 M$_{solar}$ and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around m$_{c}$\~{}0.08 M$_{solar}$ and a variance in logarithmic mass {$\sigma$}\~{}0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has m$_{c}$\~{}0.2 M$_{solar}$ and {$\sigma$}\~{}0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, n$_{BD}$\~{}n$_{*}$\~{}0.1 pc$^{-3}$. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages $\gt$\~{}130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, m$_{c}$\~{}0.2-0.3 M$_{solar}$, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below \~{}1 M$_{solar}$. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations.  These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv{\'e}nic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.  The page charges for this Review were partially covered by a generous gift from a PASP supporter.},

  abstract = {We use a large sample of galaxies from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to calculate galaxy luminosity and stellar mass functions in the local universe. We estimate corrections for passband shifting and galaxy evolution, as well as present-day stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratios, by fitting the optical-near-infrared galaxy data with simple models. Accounting for the 8\% galaxy overdensity in the SDSS early data release region, the optical and near-infrared luminosity functions we construct for this sample agree with most recent literature optical and near-infrared determinations within the uncertainties. We argue that 2MASS is biased against low surface brightness galaxies and use SDSS plus our knowledge of stellar populations to estimate the ``true'' K-band luminosity function. This has a steeper faint end slope and a slightly higher overall luminosity density than the direct estimate. Furthermore, assuming a universally applicable stellar initial mass function (IMF), we find good agreement between the stellar mass function we derive from the 2MASS/SDSS data and that derived by Cole et al. The faint end slope for the stellar mass function is steeper than -1.1, reflecting the low stellar M/L ratios characteristic of low-mass galaxies. We estimate an upper limit to the stellar mass density in the local universe {$\Omega$}$_{*}$h=2.0+/-0.6{\times}10$^{-3}$ by assuming an IMF as rich in low-mass stars as allowed by observations of galaxy dynamics in the local universe. The stellar mass density may be lower than this value if a different IMF with fewer low-mass stars is assumed. Finally, we examine type-dependence in the optical and near-infrared luminosity functions and the stellar mass function. In agreement with previous work, we find that the characteristic luminosity or mass of early-type galaxies is larger than for later types, and the faint end slope is steeper for later types than for earlier types. Accounting for typing uncertainties, we estimate that at least half, and perhaps as much as 3/4, of the stellar mass in the universe is in early-type galaxies. As an aid to workers in the field, we present in an Appendix the relationship between model stellar M/L ratios and colors in SDSS/2MASS passbands, an updated discussion of near-infrared stellar M/L ratio estimates, and the volume-corrected distribution of g- and K-band stellar M/L ratios as a function of stellar mass.},

  abstract      = {We present the results of a new study of dust attenuation at redshifts $3 \lt z \lt 4$ based on a sample of $236$ star-forming galaxies from the VANDELS spectroscopic survey. Motivated by results from the First Billion Years (FiBY) simulation project, we argue that the intrinsic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of star-forming galaxies at these redshifts have a self-similar shape across the mass range $8.2 \leq$ log$(M\_{\star}/M\_{\odot}) \leq 10.6$ probed by our sample. Using FiBY data, we construct a set of intrinsic SED templates which incorporate both detailed star formation and chemical abundance histories, and a variety of stellar population synthesis (SPS) model assumptions. With this set of intrinsic SEDs, we present a novel approach for directly recovering the shape and normalization of the dust attenuation curve. We find, across all of the intrinsic templates considered, that the average attenuation curve for star-forming galaxies at $z\simeq3.5$ is similar in shape to the commonly-adopted Calzetti starburst law, with an average total-to-selective attenuation ratio of $R\_{V}=4.18\pm0.29$. We show that the optical attenuation ($A\_V$) versus stellar mass ($M\_{\star}$) relation predicted using our method is consistent with recent ALMA observations of galaxies at $2\ltz\lt3$ in the $\backslash$emph$\{$Hubble$\}$ $\backslash$emph$\{$Ultra$\}$ $\backslash$emph$\{$Deep$\}$ $\backslash$emph$\{$Field$\}$ (HUDF), as well as empirical $A\_V - M\_{\star}$ relations predicted by a Calzetti-like law. Our results, combined with other literature data, suggest that the $A\_V - M\_{\star}$ relation does not evolve over the redshift range $0\ltz\lt5$, at least for galaxies with log$(M\_{\star}/M\_{\odot}) \gtrsim 9.5$. Finally, we present tentative evidence which suggests that the attenuation curve may become steeper at log$(M\_{\star}/M\_{\odot}) \lesssim 9.0$.},

After converting all observations to a common set of calibrations, we find a remarkable consensus among MS observations (~0.1 dex 1σ interpublication scatter). By fitting for time evolution of the MS in bins of constant mass, we deconvolve the observed scatter about the MS within each observed redshift bin. After accounting for observed scatter between different SFR indicators, we find the width of the MS distribution is ~0.2 dex and remains constant over cosmic time. Our best fits indicate the slope of the MS is likely time-dependent, with our best-fit log SFR( M * , t ) = (0.84 ± 0.02 – 0.026 ± 0.003 × t )log M * – (6.51 ± 0.24 – 0.11 ± 0.03 × t ), where t is the age of the universe in Gyr. We use our fits to create empirical evolutionary tracks in order to constrain MS galaxy star formation histories (SFHs), finding that (1) the most accurate representations of MS SFHs are given by delayed-τ models, (2) the decline in fractional stellar mass growth for a "typical" MS galaxy today is approximately linear for most of its lifetime, and (3) scatter about the MS can be generated by galaxies evolving along identical evolutionary tracks assuming an initial 1σ spread in formation times of ~1.4 Gyr.},

While confirming the established result that stellar mass must play a key role in the triggering of radio activities, we point out that for central, most massive galaxies, the radio activity also shows a strong dependence on halo mass, which is unlikely due to enhanced interaction rates in denser regions in massive, cluster-scale halos. We thus further investigate the effects of various properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) in massive clusters on the radio activities, employing two standard statistical tools, Principle Component Analysis and Logistic Regression. It is found that ICM entropy, local cooling time, and pressure are the most effective in predicting the radio activity, pointing to the accretion of gas cooling out of a hot atmosphere to be the likely origin in triggering such activities in galaxies residing in massive dark matter halos. Our analysis framework enables us to logically discern the mechanisms responsible for the radio activity separately for central and satellite galaxies.},

Galaxy groups have been selected to be in different dynamical states, namely dynamically old and dynamically young, which reflect their early and late formation times, respectively, based on their halo mass assembly. Brightest galaxies in dynamically young groups have suffered their last major galaxy merger typically $\sim 2$ Gyr more recently than their counterparts in dynamically old groups. Furthermore, we study the evolution of velocity dispersion in these two classes and compare them with the analytic models of isolated halos. The velocity dispersion of dwarf galaxies in high mass, dynamically young groups increases slowly in time, while the analogous dispersion in dynamically old high-mass groups is constant. In contrast, the velocity dispersion of giant galaxies in low mass groups decreases rapidly at late times. This increasing velocity bias is caused by dynamical friction, and starts much earlier in the dynamically old groups. The recent Radio-SAGE model of galaxy formation suggests that radio luminosities of central galaxies, considered to be tracers of AGN activity, are linked to the formation history of their halos.},

However, the effects of this feedback as a function of redshift and galaxy properties such as mass, environment and cold gas content remain poorly understood. The broad frequency coverage (1 to 116 GHz), high sensitivity (up to ten times higher than the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array), and superb angular resolution (maximum baselines of at least a few hundred km) of the proposed next generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) are uniquely poised to revolutionize our understanding of AGNs and their role in galaxy evolution. Here, we provide an overview of the science related to AGN feedback that will be possible in the ngVLA era and present new continuum ngVLA imaging simulations of resolved radio jets spanning a wide range of intrinsic extents. We also consider key computational challenges and discuss exciting opportunities for multi-wavelength synergy with other next-generation instruments, such as the Square Kilometer Array and the James Webb Space Telescope. The unique combination of high-resolution, large collecting area, and wide frequency range will enable significant advancements in our understanding of the effects of jet-driven feedback on sub-galactic scales, particularly for sources with extents of a few pc to a few kpc such as young and/or lower-power radio AGNs, AGNs hosted by low-mass galaxies, radio jets that are interacting strongly with the interstellar medium of the host galaxy, and AGNs at high redshift.},

In this study, we explore this possibility, applying constraints from the cosmic microwave background, light element abundances, Supernova 1987A, and a variety of laboratory experiments. After taking these constraints into account, we find that the vast majority of the parameter space capable of generating the observed 21-cm signal is ruled out.

The model combines the parametrized rate of orbital evolution of SBHBs in circumbinary disks with the selection effects of spectroscopic surveys and returns a multivariate likelihood for SBHB detection. Based on this model we find that in order to evolve into the detection window of the spectroscopic searches from larger separations in less than a Hubble time, $10^8M\_\odot$ SBHBs must, on average, experience angular momentum transport faster than that provided by a disk with accretion rate $0.06\,\dot{M}\_E$. Spectroscopic searches with yearly cadence of observations are in principle sensitive to binaries with orbital separations $\lt {\rm few}\times 10^4\, r\_g$ ($r\_g = GM/c^2$ and $M$ is the binary mass), and for every one SBHB in this range there should be over 200 more gravitationally bound systems with similar properties, at larger separations. Furthermore, for each observed $10^8M\_\odot$ SBHB with mass ratio 0.3 and orbital separation $10^4\,r\_g$, the projection factors imply five undetected binaries. This model can be used to infer the most likely orbital parameters for observed SBHB candidates and to provide constraints on the rate of orbital evolution of SBHBs, if observed candidates are shown to be genuine binaries.},
