  abstract      = {Star-formation rates (SFR) of disk galaxies strongly correlate with stellar mass, with a small dispersion in SSFR at fixed mass, sigma\~{}0.3 dex. With such small scatter this star-formation main sequence (SFMS) has been interpreted as deterministic and fundamental. Here we demonstrate that it is a simple consequence of the central limit theorem. Our derivation begins by approximating in situ stellar mass growth as a stochastic process, much like a random walk (where the expectation of SFR at any time is equal to the SFR at the previous time). We then derive expectation values for median SSFR of star-forming disks and their scatter over time. We generalize the results for stochastic changes in SFR that are not independent of each other but are correlated over time. For unbiased samples of (disk) galaxies, we derive an expectation that $\lt$SSFR$\gt$ should be independent of mass, decline as 1/T, and have a relative scatter that is independent of mass and time. The derived SFMS and its evolution matches published data to z=10 with sufficient accuracy to constrain cosmological parameters. The framework reproduces several important observables, including: the scatter in SSFR at fixed mass; the SFHs of nearby dwarf galaxies and the Milky Way; and the scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation. The evolution of the mass function is less well reproduced and we discuss ways to generalize the framework to include other sources of stellar mass such as mergers. The predicted dispersion in SSFR has consequences for the classification of quiescent galaxies, as such galaxies have heterogeneous formation histories, and many may only be temporarily diminished in their star-formation activity. The implied dispersion in SFHs, and the SFMS's insensitivity to timescales of stochasticity, thus substantially limits the ability to connect massive galaxies to their progenitors over long cosmic baselines.

  abstract      = {We present new determinations of the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) at z = 0-10 that match the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function, the star formation rate (SFR)-M$_{*}$ relation and the cosmic SFR. We utilize a compilation of 40 observational studies from the literature and correct them for potential biases. Using our robust determinations of halo mass assembly and the SHMR, we infer star formation histories, merger rates and structural properties for average galaxies, combining star-forming and quenched galaxies. Our main findings are as follows: (1) The halo mass M$_{50}$ above which 50 per cent of galaxies are quenched coincides with sSFR/sMAR {\tilde} 1, where sSFR is the specific SFR and sMAR is the specific halo mass accretion rate. (2) M$_{50}$ increases with redshift, presumably due to cold streams being more efficient at high redshifts, while virial shocks and active galactic nucleus feedback become more relevant at lower redshifts. (3) The ratio sSFR/sMAR has a peak value, which occurs around $\{$M\_vir$\}${\tilde} 2{\times} 10\^{}$\{$11$\}$ M\_$\{${\sun}$\}$. (4) The stellar mass density within 1 kpc, {$\Sigma$}$_{1}$, is a good indicator of the galactic global sSFR. (5) Galaxies are statistically quenched after they reach a maximum in {$\Sigma$}$_{1}$, consistent with theoretical expectations of the gas compaction model; this maximum depends on redshift. (6) In-situ star formation is responsible for most galactic stellar mass growth, especially for lower mass galaxies. (7) Galaxies grow inside-out. The marked change in the slope of the size-mass relation when galaxies became quenched, from d log $\{$R\_eff$\}$/d log $\{$M\_*$\}${\tilde} 0.35 to {\tilde}2.5, could be the result of dry minor mergers.},

  abstract      = {The star-formation history (SFH) of galaxies is a key assumption to derive their physical properties and can lead to strong biases. In this work, we derive the SFH of main sequence (MS) galaxies and show how the peak SFH of a galaxy depends on its seed mass at, for example, z = 5. This seed mass reflects the galaxy's underlying dark matter (DM) halo environment. We show that, following the MS, galaxies undergo a drastic slow down of their stellar mass growth after reaching the peak of their SFH. According to abundance matching, these masses correspond to hot and massive DM halos which state could result in less efficient gas inflows on the galaxies and thus could be the origin of limited stellar mass growth. As a result, we show that galaxies, still on the MS, can enter the passive region of the UVJ diagram while still forming stars. The best fit to the MS SFH is provided by a right skew peak function for which we provide parameters depending on the seed mass of the galaxy. The ability of the classical analytical SFHs to retrieve the star-formation rate (SFR) of galaxies from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting is studied. Due to mathematical limitations, the exponentially declining and delayed SFH struggle to model high SFR, which starts to be problematic at z $\gt$ 2. The exponentially rising and log-normal SFHs exhibit the opposite behavior with the ability to reach very high SFR, and thus model starburst galaxies, but they are not able to model low values such as those expected at low redshift for massive galaxies. By simulating galaxies SED from the MS SFH, we show that these four analytical forms recover the SFR of MS galaxies with an error dependent on the model and the redshift. They are, however, sensitive enough to probe small variations of SFR within the MS, with an error ranging from 5 to 40\% depending on the SFH assumption and redshift; but all the four fail to recover the SFR of rapidly quenched galaxies. However, these SFHs lead to an artificial gradient of age, parallel to the MS, which is not exhibited by the simulated sample. This gradient is also produced on real data as we show using a sample of real galaxies with redshifts between 1.5 and 2.5. Here, we propose an SFH composed of a delayed form to model the bulk of stellar population with the addition of a flexibility in the recent SFH. This SFH provides very good estimates of the SFR of MS, starbursts, and rapidly quenched galaxies at all redshift. Furthermore, when used on the real sample, the age gradient disappears which show its dependency on the SFH assumption made to perform the SED fitting.},

Our study moves beyond {\ldquo}average{\rdquo} SFHs and distribution functions of specific star-formation rates (sSFRs) to individually measured SFHs for tens of thousands of galaxies. By comparing star-formation rates (SFRs) with timescales of $\{$10$\}$$^{10}$,$\{$10$\}$$^{9}$, and 10$^{8}$ years, we find a wide diversity of SFHs: {\ldquo}old galaxies{\rdquo} that formed most or all of their stars early, galaxies that formed stars with declining or constant SFRs over a Hubble time, and genuinely {\ldquo}young galaxies{\rdquo} that formed most of their stars since z = 1. This sequence is one of decreasing stellar mass, but remarkably, each type is found over a mass range of a factor of 10. Conversely, galaxies at any given mass follow a wide range of SFHs, leading us to conclude that (1) halo mass does not uniquely determine SFHs, (2) there is no {\ldquo}typical{\rdquo} evolutionary track, and (3) {\ldquo}abundance matching{\rdquo} has limitations as a tool for inferring physics. Our observations imply that SFHs are set at an early epoch, and that{\mdash}for most galaxies{\mdash}the decline and cessation of star formation occurs over a Hubble time, without distinct {\ldquo}quenching{\rdquo} events. SFH diversity is inconsistent with models where galaxy mass, at any given epoch, grows simply along relations between SFR and stellar mass, but is consistent with a two-parameter lognormal form, lending credence to this model from a new and independent perspective.

  abstract      = {[abridged] Building upon a previous study, we define a method to blindly identify galaxies that underwent, and may still be undergoing, a fast downfall of their star-formation activity, that is, a more than 80\% drop in star-formation rate (SFR) occurring in less than 500 Myr. Modeling galaxies' SED with a delayed-$\tau$ star formation history (SFH), with and without allowing an instantaneous SFR drop within the last hundreds Myr, we isolate 102 candidates out of a subsample of 6,680 galaxies classified as star-forming from the UVJ criterion in the ZFOURGE catalogues. These galaxies are mostly located in the lower part of the SFR-M$\_*$ main sequence (MS) and extend up to a factor 100 below it. They also lie close to the limit between the passive and active regions on the UVJ diagram, indicating that they are in a transition phase. We show that the selected candidates have different physical properties compared to galaxies with similar UVJ colors, namely, lower star-formation rates and different stellar masses. The morphology of the candidates show no preference for a particular type. Among the 102 candidates, only 4 show signs of an AGN activity (from X-ray luminosity or UV-IR SED fitting decomposition). This low fraction of AGNs among the candidates implies that AGN activity may not be the main driver of the recent downfall, although timescale differences and duty cycle must be taken into account. We finally attempt to recover the past position of these galaxies on the SFR-M$\_*$ plane, before the downfall of their star-formation and show that some of them were in the starburst region before and are back on the MS. These candidates constitute a promising sample that need more investigation in order to understand the different mechanisms at the origin of the star formation decrease of the Universe since $z$$\sim$2.},

  abstract      = {We describe the Carnegie-Spitzer-IMACS (CSI) Survey, a wide-field, near-IR selected spectrophotometric redshift survey with the Inamori Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph (IMACS) on Magellan-Baade. By defining a flux-limited sample of galaxies in Spitzer Infrared Array Camera 3.6 {$\mu$}m imaging of SWIRE fields, the CSI Survey efficiently traces the stellar mass of average galaxies to z \~{} 1.5. This first paper provides an overview of the survey selection, observations, processing of the photometry and spectrophotometry. We also describe the processing of the data: new methods of fitting synthetic templates of spectral energy distributions are used to derive redshifts, stellar masses, emission line luminosities, and coarse information on recent star formation. Our unique methodology for analyzing low-dispersion spectra taken with multilayer prisms in IMACS, combined with panchromatic photometry from the ultraviolet to the IR, has yielded high-quality redshifts for 43,347 galaxies in our first 5.3 deg$^{2}$ of the SWIRE XMM-LSS field. We use three different approaches to estimate our redshift errors and find robust agreement. Over the full range of 3.6 {$\mu$}m fluxes of our selection, we find typical redshift uncertainties of {$\sigma$}$_{ z }$/(1 + z) $\lt$\~{} 0.015. In comparisons with previously published spectroscopic redshifts we find scatters of {$\sigma$}$_{ z }$/(1 + z) = 0.011 for galaxies at 0.7 $\lt$= z $\lt$= 0.9, and {$\sigma$}$_{ z }$/(1 + z) = 0.014 for galaxies at 0.9 $\lt$= z $\lt$= 1.2. For galaxies brighter and fainter than i = 23 mag, we find {$\sigma$}$_{ z }$/(1 + z) = 0.008 and {$\sigma$}$_{ z }$/(1 + z) = 0.022, respectively. Notably, our low-dispersion spectroscopy and analysis yields comparable redshift uncertainties and success rates for both red and blue galaxies, largely eliminating color-based systematics that can seriously bias observed dependencies of galaxy evolution on environment.

We show that the mass-weighted age of a galaxy correlates strongly with stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma\_*$) and ongoing star-formation (SF) activity, with the stellar content in higher-$\sigma\_*$ galaxies having formed earlier and faster. The SFHs of quiescent galaxies are generally consistent with passive evolution since their main SF epoch, but a minority show clear evidence of a rejuvenation event in their recent past. The mean age of stars in galaxies that are star-forming is generally significantly younger, with SF peaking after $z\lt1.5$ for almost all star-forming galaxies in the sample: many of these still have either constant or rising SFRs on timescales $\gt100$Myrs. This indicates that $z\gt2$ progenitors of $z\sim1$ star-forming galaxies are generally far less massive. Finally, despite considerable variance in the individual SFHs, we show that the current SF activity of massive galaxies ($\gt$L$\_*$) at $z\sim1$ correlates with SF levels at least $3$Gyrs prior: SFHs retain `memory' on a large fraction of the Hubble time. Our results illustrate a novel approach to resolve the formation phase of galaxies, and in identifying their individual evolutionary paths, connects progenitors and descendants across cosmic time. This is uniquely enabled by the high-quality continuum spectroscopy provided by the LEGA-C survey.},

We estimate stellar masses for our sample by fitting the observed spectral energy distributions with synthetic stellar populations, including nebular line and continuum emission. The observed UV luminosity functions for the samples are consistent with previous observations; however, we find that the observed M$_{UV}$-M$_{*}$ relation has a shallow slope more consistent with a constant mass-to-light ratio and a normalization which evolves with redshift. Our stellar mass functions have steep low-mass slopes ({$\alpha$} {\ap} -1.9), steeper than previously observed at these redshifts and closer to that of the UV luminosity function.

In the present work, we perform a comprehensive calibration of our own flexible SPS (FSPS) model against a suite of data. These data include ultraviolet, optical, and near-IR photometry, surface brightness fluctuations, and integrated spectra of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs), M87, M31, and the Milky Way (MW), and photometry and spectral indices of both quiescent and post-starburst galaxies at z \~{} 0. Several public SPS models are intercompared, including the models of Bruzual {\amp} Charlot (BC03), Maraston (M05), and FSPS. The relative strengths and weaknesses of these models are evaluated, with the following conclusions: (1) the FSPS and BC03 models compare favorably with MC data at all ages, whereas M05 colors are too red and the age dependence is incorrect; (2) all models yield similar optical and near-IR colors for old metal-poor systems, and yet they all provide poor fits to the integrated J - K and V - K colors of both MW and M31 star clusters; (3) FSPS is able to fit all of the ultraviolet data because both the post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) and horizontal branch evolutionary phases are handled flexibly, while the BC03 and M05 models fail in the far-UV, and both far- and near-UV, respectively; (4) all models predict ugr colors too red, D $_{ n }$4000 strengths too strong, and H{$\delta$}$_{ A }$ strengths too weak compared to massive red sequence galaxies, under the assumption that such galaxies are composed solely of old metal-rich stars; and (5) FSPS and, to a lesser extent, BC03 can reproduce the optical and near-IR colors of post-starburst galaxies, while M05 cannot. Reasons for these discrepancies are explored. The failure at predicting the ugr colors, D $_{ n }$4000, and H{$\delta$}$_{ A }$ strengths can be explained by some combination of a minority population of metal-poor stars, young stars, blue straggler and/or blue horizontal branch (HB) stars, but not by appealing to inadequacies in either theoretical stellar atmospheres or canonical evolutionary phases (e.g., the main-sequence turnoff). The different model predictions in the near-IR for intermediate age systems are due to different treatments of the thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch stellar evolutionary phase. We emphasize that due to a lack of calibrating star cluster data in regions of the metallicity-age plane relevant for galaxies, all of these models continue to suffer from serious uncertainties that are difficult to quantify.},

Each of these necessary inputs carries significant uncertainties that have until now received little systematic attention. The present work is the first in a series that explores the impact of uncertainties in key phases of stellar evolution and the IMF on the derived physical properties of galaxies and the expected luminosity evolution for a passively evolving set of stars. A Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach is taken to fit near-UV through near-IR photometry of a representative sample of low- and high-redshift galaxies with this new SPS model. Significant results include the following. (1) Including uncertainties in stellar evolution, stellar masses at z \~{} 0 carry errors of \~{}0.3 dex at 95\% CL with little dependence on luminosity or color, while at z \~{} 2, the masses of bright red galaxies are uncertain at the \~{}0.6 dex level. (2) Either current stellar evolution models, current observational stellar libraries, or both, do not adequately characterize the metallicity-dependence of the thermally pulsating AGB phase. (3) Conservative estimates on the uncertainty of the slope of the IMF in the solar neighborhood imply that luminosity evolution per unit redshift is uncertain at the \~{}0.4 mag level in the K band, which is a substantial source of uncertainty for interpreting the evolution of galaxy populations across time. Any possible evolution in the IMF, as suggested by several independent lines of evidence, will only exacerbate this problem. (4) Assuming a distribution of stellar metallicities within a galaxy, rather than a fixed value as is usually assumed, can yield important differences when considering bands blueward of V, but is not a concern for redder bands. Spectroscopic information may alleviate some of these concerns, though uncertainties in the stellar spectral libraries and the importance of nonsolar abundance ratios have not yet been systematically investigated in the SPS context.},

This data set is combined with ancillary optical and NIR fluxes to constrain the dust attenuation law in the rest-frame NUV region of star-forming galaxies within the redshift window 1.5 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3. We focus on the NUV bump strength (B) and the total-to-selective extinction ratio (R$_{V}$), targeting a sample of 1753 galaxies. By comparing the data with a set of population synthesis models coupled to a parametric dust attenuation law, we constrain R$_{V}$ and B, as well as the colour excess, E(B - V). We find a correlation between R$_{V}$ and B, which can be interpreted either as a result of the grain size distribution, or a variation of the dust geometry among galaxies. According to the former, small dust grains are associated with a stronger NUV bump. The latter would lead to a range of clumpiness in the distribution of dust within the interstellar medium of star-forming galaxies. The observed wide range of NUV bump strengths can lead to a systematic in the interpretation of the UV slope {$\beta$} typically used to characterize the dust content. In this study, we quantify these variations, concluding that the effects are {$\Delta$}{$\beta$} {\tilde} 0.4.},

These observations are being used to: (1) derive for the first time an unbiased sample of high-z quiescent galaxies, which extends to fainter magnitudes the samples selected with color techniques and spectroscopic surveys; (2) derive accurate ages and stellar masses based on robust measurements of spectral features such as the Mg(UV) or D(4000) indices; (3) measure their redshift with an accuracy Delta(z)/(1+z)$\lt$0.02; and (4) study emission-line galaxies (starbursts and AGN) up to very high redshifts.

  abstract      = {We perform spatially resolved, pixel-by-pixel Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting on galaxies up to z {\tilde} 2.5 in the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (XDF). Comparing stellar mass estimates from spatially resolved and spatially unresolved photometry we find that unresolved masses can be systematically underestimated by factors of up to 5. The ratio of the unresolved to resolved mass measurement depends on the galaxy's specific star formation rate (sSFR): at low sSFRs the bias is small, but above sSFR {\tilde} 10$^{-9.5}$ yr$^{-1}$ the discrepancy increases rapidly such that galaxies with sSFRs {\tilde} 10$^{-8}$ yr$^{-1}$ have unresolved mass estimates of only one-half to one-fifth of the resolved value. This result indicates that stellar masses estimated from spatially unresolved data sets need to be systematically corrected, in some cases by large amounts, and we provide an analytic prescription for applying this correction. We show that correcting stellar mass measurements for this bias changes the normalization and slope of the star-forming main sequence and reduces its intrinsic width; most dramatically, correcting for the mass bias increases the stellar mass density of the Universe at high redshift and can resolve the long-standing discrepancy between the directly measured cosmic SFR density at z {\gsim} 1 and that inferred from stellar mass densities (`the missing mass problem').},

  abstract = {This is the second paper in a series aimed at investigating the main sources of uncertainty in measuring the observable parameters in galaxies from their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). In the first paper we presented a detailed account of the photometric redshift measurements and an error analysis of this process. In this paper we perform a comprehensive study of the main sources of random and systematic error in stellar mass estimates for galaxies, and their relative contributions to the associated error budget. Since there is no prior knowledge of the stellar mass of galaxies (unlike their photometric redshifts), we use mock galaxy catalogs with simulated multi-waveband photometry and known redshift, stellar mass, age and extinction for individual galaxies. The multi-waveband photometry for the simulated galaxies were generated in 13 filters spanning from U -band to mid-infrared wavelengths. Given different parameters affecting stellar mass measurement (photometric signal-to-noise ratios (S/N), SED fitting errors and systematic effects), the inherent degeneracies and correlated errors, we formulated different simulated galaxy catalogs to quantify these effects individually. For comparison, we also generated catalogs based on observed photometric data of real galaxies in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-South field, spanning the same passbands. The simulated and observed catalogs were provided to a number of teams within the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey collaboration to estimate the stellar masses for individual galaxies. A total of 11 teams participated, with different combinations of stellar mass measurement codes/methods, population synthesis models, star formation histories, extinction and age. For each simulated galaxy, the differences between the input stellar masses, M input , and those estimated by each team, M est , is defined as ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/808/1/101/apj515559ieqn1.gif] {${\rm{\Delta }}\mathrm{log}(M)\equiv \mathrm{log}({M}_{\mathrm{estimated}})-\mathrm{log}({M}_{\mathrm{input}})$} , and used to identify the most fundamental parameters affecting stellar mass estimate in galaxies, with the following results. (1) No significant bias in Δ log( M ) was found among different codes, with all having comparable scatter ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/808/1/101/apj515559ieqn2.gif] {$\sigma ({\rm{\Delta }}\mathrm{log}(M))=0.136$} dex). The estimated stellar mass values are seriously affected by low photometric S/N, with the rms scatter increasing for galaxies with ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/808/1/101/apj515559ieqn3.gif] {${H}_{\mathrm{AB}}\gt 26$} mag; (2) A source of error contributing to the scatter in Δ log( M ) is found to be due to photometric uncertainties (0.136 dex) and low resolution in age and extinction grids when generating the SED templates; (3) The median of stellar masses among different methods provides a stable measure of the mass associated with any given galaxy ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/808/1/101/apj515559ieqn4.gif] {$\sigma ({\rm{\Delta }}\mathrm{log}(M))=0.142$} dex); (4) The Δ log( M ) values are strongly correlated with deviations in age (defined as the difference between the estimated and expected values), with a weaker correlation with extinction; (5) The rms scatter in the estimated stellar masses due to free parameters (after fixing redshifts and initial mass function) are quantified and found to be ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/808/1/101/apj515559ieqn5.gif] {$\sigma ({\rm{\Delta }}\mathrm{log}(M))=0.110$} dex; (6) Using the observed data, we studied the sensitivity of stellar masses to both the population synthesis codes and inclusion of nebular emission lines and found them to affect the stellar mass by 0.2 and 0.3 dex respectively.},

  abstract      = {We explore the dependence of galaxy stellar population properties that are derived from broad-band spectral energy distribution fitting - such as age, stellar mass, dust reddening, etc. - on a variety of parameters, such as star formation histories, age grid, metallicity, initial mass function (IMF), dust reddening and reddening law, filter setup and wavelength coverage. Mock galaxies are used as test particles. We confirm our earlier results based on real z= 2 galaxies, that usually adopted {$\tau$}-models lead to overestimate the star formation rate and to underestimate the stellar mass. Here, we show that - for star-forming galaxies - galaxy ages, masses and reddening can be well determined simultaneously only when the correct star formation history is identified. This is the case for inverted-{$\tau$} models at high-z, for which we find that the mass recovery (at fixed IMF) is as good as {\tilde}0.04 dex. However, since the right star formation history is usually unknown, we quantify the offsets generated by adopting standard fitting setups. Stellar masses are generally underestimated, which results from underestimating the age. For mixed fitting setups with a variety of star formation histories the median mass recovery at z{\tilde} 2-3 is as decent as {\tilde}0.1 dex (at fixed IMF), albeit with large scatter. The situation worsens towards lower redshifts, because of the variety of possible star formation histories and ages. At z{\tilde} 0.5 the stellar mass can be underestimated by as much as {\tilde}0.6 dex (at fixed IMF). A practical trick to improve upon this figure is to exclude reddening from the fitting parameters, as this helps to avoid unrealistically young and dusty solutions. Stellar masses are underestimated by a smaller amount ({\tilde}0.3 dex at z{\tilde} 0.5). Reddening and the star formation rate should then be determined via a separate fitting. As expected, the recovery of properties is better for passive galaxies, for which e.g. the mass can be fully recovered (within {\tilde}0.01 dex at fixed IMF) when using a fitting setup including metallicity effects. In both cases of star-forming as well as passive galaxies, the recovery of physical parameters is dependent on the spectral range involved in the fitting. We find that a coverage from the rest-frame ultraviolet to the rest-frame near-infrared appears to be optimal. We also quantify the effect of narrowing the wavelength coverage or adding and removing filter bands, which can be useful for planning observational surveys. Finally, we provide scaling relations that allow the transformation of stellar masses obtained using different template fitting setups and stellar population models.},

  abstract      = {We present the Survey for High-z Absorption Red and Dead Sources (SHARDS), an ESO/GTC Large Program carried out using the OSIRIS instrument on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). SHARDS is an ultra-deep optical spectro-photometric survey of the GOODS-N field covering 130 arcmin$^{2}$ at wavelengths between 500 and 950 nm with 24 contiguous medium-band filters (providing a spectral resolution R \~{} 50). The data reach an AB magnitude of 26.5 (at least at a 3{$\sigma$} level) with sub-arcsec seeing in all bands. SHARDS' main goal is to obtain accurate physical properties of intermediate- and high-z galaxies using well-sampled optical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with sufficient spectral resolution to measure absorption and emission features, whose analysis will provide reliable stellar population and active galactic nucleus (AGN) parameters. Among the different populations of high-z galaxies, SHARDS' principal targets are massive quiescent galaxies at z $\gt$ 1, whose existence is one of the major challenges facing current hierarchical models of galaxy formation. In this paper, we outline the observational strategy and include a detailed discussion of the special reduction and calibration procedures which should be applied to the GTC/OSIRIS data. An assessment of the SHARDS data quality is also performed. We present science demonstration results on the detection and study of emission-line galaxies (star-forming objects and AGNs) at z = 0-5. We also analyze the SEDs for a sample of 27 quiescent massive galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the range 1.0 $\lt$ z $\lt$\~{} 1.4. We discuss the improvements introduced by the SHARDS data set in the analysis of their star formation history and stellar properties. We discuss the systematics arising from the use of different stellar population libraries, typical in this kind of study. Averaging the results from the different libraries, we find that the UV-to-MIR SEDs of the massive quiescent galaxies at z = 1.0-1.4 are well described by an exponentially decaying star formation history with scale {$\tau$} = 100-200 Myr, age around 1.5-2.0 Gyr, solar or slightly sub-solar metallicity, and moderate extinction, A(V) \~{} 0.5 mag. We also find that galaxies with masses above M* are typically older than lighter galaxies, as expected in a downsizing scenario of galaxy formation. This trend is, however, model dependent, i.e., it is significantly more evident in the results obtained with some stellar population synthesis libraries, and almost absent in others.},

  abstract      = {We investigate the properties of galaxies as they shut off star formation over the 4 billion years surrounding peak cosmic star formation. To do this we categorize $\sim7000$ galaxies from $1\ltz\lt4$ into $90$ groups based on the shape of their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and build composite SEDs with $R\sim 50$ resolution. These composite SEDs show a variety of spectral shapes and also show trends in parameters such as color, mass, star formation rate, and emission line equivalent width. Using emission line equivalent widths and strength of the 4000$\backslash$AA$\backslash$ break, $D(4000)$, we categorize the composite SEDs into five classes: extreme emission line, star-forming, transitioning, post-starburst, and quiescent galaxies. The transitioning population of galaxies show modest H$\alpha$ emission ($EW\_{\rm REST}\sim40$$\backslash$AA) compared to more typical star-forming composite SEDs at $\log\_{10}(M/M\_\odot)\sim10.5$ ($EW\_{\rm REST}\sim80$$\backslash$AA). Together with their smaller sizes (3 kpc vs. 4 kpc) and higher S$\backslash$'ersic indices (2.7 vs. 1.5), this indicates that morphological changes initiate before the cessation of star formation. The transitional group shows a strong increase of over one dex in number density from $z\sim3$ to $z\sim1$, similar to the growth in the quiescent population, while post-starburst galaxies become rarer at $z\lesssim1.5$. We calculate average quenching timescales of 1.6 Gyr at $z\sim1.5$ and 0.9 Gyr at $z\sim2.5$ and conclude that a fast quenching mechanism producing post-starbursts dominated the quenching of galaxies at early times, while a slower process has become more common since $z\sim2$.},

Additionally, we include far infrared photometry from the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Herschel Space Observatory to characterize the infrared properties of our diverse set of composite SEDs.

Blue star-forming composite SEDs show IRX and {$\beta$} values consistent with local relations; dusty star-forming galaxies have considerable scatter, as found for local IR bright sources, but on average appear bluer than expected for their IR fluxes. We measure a tight linear relation between rest-frame UVJ colors and dust attenuation for star-forming composites, providing a direct method for estimating dust content from either (U - V) or (V-J) rest-frame colors for star-forming galaxies at intermediate redshifts.

  abstract      = {Using deep multi-wavelength photometry of galaxies from zfourge, we group galaxies at 2.5$\lt$ z$\lt$ 4.0 by the shape of their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We identify a population of galaxies with excess emission in the K $_{ s }$-band, which corresponds to [O III]+H{$\beta$} emission at 2.95$\lt$ z$\lt$ 3.65. This population includes 78\% of the bluest galaxies with UV slopes steeper than {$\beta$} =-2. We de-redshift and scale this photometry to build two composite SEDs, enabling us to measure equivalent widths of these extreme [O III]+H{$\beta$} emission line galaxies (EELGs) at z{\tilde} 3.5. We identify 60 galaxies that comprise a composite SED with a [O III]+H{$\beta$} rest-frame equivalent width of 803 {\plusmn} 228 {\AA} and another 218 galaxies in a composite SED with an equivalent width of 230 {\plusmn} 90 {\AA}. These EELGs are analogous to the {\ldquo}green peas{\rdquo} found in the SDSS and are thought to be undergoing their first burst of star formation due to their blue colors ({$\beta$} $\lt$ -1.6), young ages ($\{$log$\}$($\{$age$\}$ $\{$$\{$yr$\}$$\}$$^{-1}$){\tilde} 7.2), and low dust attenuation values. Their strong nebular emission lines and compact sizes (typically {\tilde}1.4 kpc) are consistent with the properties of the star-forming galaxies possibly responsible for reionizing the universe at z$\gt$ 6. Many of the EELGs also exhibit Ly{$\alpha$} emission. Additionally, we find that many of these sources are clustered in an overdensity in the Chandra Deep Field South, with five spectroscopically confirmed members at z=3.474+/- 0.004. The spatial distribution and photometric redshifts of the zfourge population further confirm the overdensity highlighted by the EELGs.  This Letter includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

  abstract      = {Fitting the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies is an almost universally used technique that has matured significantly in the last decade. Model predictions and fitting procedures have improved significantly over this time, attempting to keep up with the vastly increased volume and quality of available data. We review here the field of SED fitting, describing the modelling of ultraviolet to infrared galaxy SEDs, the creation of multiwavelength data sets, and the methods used to fit model SEDs to observed galaxy data sets. We touch upon the achievements and challenges in the major ingredients of SED fitting, with a special emphasis on describing the interplay between the quality of the available data, the quality of the available models, and the best fitting technique to use in order to obtain a realistic measurement as well as realistic uncertainties. We conclude that SED fitting can be used effectively to derive a range of physical properties of galaxies, such as redshift, stellar masses, star formation rates, dust masses, and metallicities, with care taken not to over-interpret the available data. Yet there still exist many issues such as estimating the age of the oldest stars in a galaxy, finer details of dust properties and dust-star geometry, and the influences of poorly understood, luminous stellar types and phases. The challenge for the coming years will be to improve both the models and the observational data sets to resolve these uncertainties. The present review will be made available on an interactive, moderated web page (http://sedfitting.org), where the community can access and change the text. The intention is to expand the text and keep it up to date over the coming years.},

  abstract = {We present far-infrared (FIR) photometry at 150 and 205 {$\mu$}m of eight low-redshift starburst galaxies obtained with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) ISOPHOT. Five of the eight galaxies are detected in both wave bands, and these data are used, in conjunction with IRAS archival photometry, to model the dust emission at {$\lambda$}$\gt$\~{}40 {$\mu$}m. The FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are best fitted by a combination of two modified Planck functions, with T\~{}40-55 K (warm dust) and T\~{}20-23 K (cool dust) and with a dust emissivity index {$\epsilon$}=2. The cool dust can be a major contributor to the FIR emission of starburst galaxies, representing up to 60\% of the total flux. This component is heated not only by the general interstellar radiation field, but also by the starburst itself. The cool dust mass is up to \~{}150 times larger than the warm dust mass, bringing the gas-to-dust ratios of the starbursts in our sample close to Milky Way values, once rescaled for the appropriate metallicity. The ratio between the total dust FIR emission in the range 1-1000 {$\mu$}m and the IRAS FIR emission in the range 40-120 {$\mu$}m is \~{}1.75, with small variations from galaxy to galaxy. This ratio is about 40\% larger than previously inferred from data at millimeter wavelengths. Although the galaxies in our sample are generally classified as ``UV bright,'' for four of them the UV energy emerging shortward of 0.2 {$\mu$}m is less than 15\% of the FIR energy. On average, about 30\% of the bolometric flux is coming out in the UV-to-near-IR wavelength range; the rest is emitted in the FIR. Energy balance calculations show that the FIR emission predicted by the dust reddening of the UV-to-near-IR stellar emission is within a factor of \~{}2 of the observed value in individual galaxies and within 20\% when averaged over a large sample. If our sample of local starbursts is representative of high-redshift (z$\gt$\~{}1), UV-bright, star-forming galaxies, these galaxies' FIR emission will be generally undetected in submillimeter surveys, unless (1) their bolometric luminosity is comparable to or larger than that of ultraluminous FIR galaxies and (2) their FIR SED contains a cool dust component.

  abstract = {We present a new model for computing the effects of dust on the integrated spectral properties of galaxies, based on an idealized description of the main features of the interstellar medium (ISM). The model includes the ionization of H II regions in the interiors of the dense clouds in which stars form and the influence of the finite lifetime of these clouds on the absorption of radiation. We compute the production of emission lines and the absorption of continuum radiation in the H II regions and the subsequent transfer of line and continuum radiation in the surrounding H I regions and the ambient ISM. This enables us to interpret simultaneously all the observations of an ultraviolet-selected sample of nearby starburst galaxies, including the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities, the ratio of H{$\alpha$} to H{$\beta$} luminosities, the H{$\alpha$} equivalent width, and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We show that the finite lifetime of stellar birth clouds is a key ingredient for resolving an apparent discrepancy between the attenuation of line and continuum photons in starburst galaxies. In addition, we find that an effective absorption curve proportional to {$\lambda$}$^{-0.7}$ reproduces the observed relation between the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We interpret this relation most simply as a sequence in the overall dust content of the galaxies. The shallow wavelength dependence of the effective absorption curve is compatible with the steepness of known extinction curves if the dust has a patchy distribution. In particular, we find that a random distribution of discrete clouds with optical depths similar to those in the Milky Way provides a consistent interpretation of all the observations. A noteworthy outcome of our detailed analysis is that the observed mean relations for starburst galaxies can be closely approximated by the following simple recipe: use an effective absorption curve proportional to {$\lambda$}$^{-0.7}$ to attenuate the line and continuum radiation from each stellar generation, and lower the normalization of the curve, typically by a factor of 3 after 10$^{7}$ yr, to account for the dispersal of the birth clouds. This recipe or our full model for absorption can be incorporated easily into any population synthesis model.},

We also report halo mass accretion rates and concentrations. We show that the higher cosmological matter density of the Planck parameters compared with the WMAP parameters leads to higher abundance of massive haloes at high redshifts. We find that the median halo spin parameter $\{${$\lambda$} \_B$\}$= J({\surd}$\{$2$\}$M\_virR\_virV\_vir)\^{}$\{$-1$\}$ is nearly independent of redshift, leading to predicted evolution of galaxy sizes that is consistent with observations, while the significant decrease with redshift in median $\{${$\lambda$} \_P$\}$= J|E|\^{}$\{$-1/2$\}$G\^{}$\{$-1$\}$M\^{}$\{$-5/2$\}$ predicts more decrease in galaxy sizes than is observed. Using the Tully-Fisher and Faber-Jackson relations between galaxy velocity and mass, we show that a simple model of how galaxy velocity is related to halo maximum circular velocity leads to increasing overprediction of cosmic stellar mass density as redshift increases beyond z {\tilde} 1, implying that such velocity-mass relations must change at z {\gsim} 1. By making a realistic model of how observed galaxy velocities are related to halo circular velocity, we show that recent optical and radio observations of the abundance of galaxies are in good agreement with our {$\Lambda$}CDM simulations. Our halo demographics are based on updated versions of the ROCKSTAR and CONSISTENT TREES codes, and this paper includes appendices explaining all of their outputs. This paper is an introduction to a series of related papers presenting other analyses of the Bolshoi-Planck and MultiDark-Planck simulations.},

We assign a star formation rate to each dark matter halo based on its growth rate, which specifies how much baryonic material becomes available, and the instantaneous baryon conversion efficiency, which determines how efficiently this material is converted to stars, thereby capturing the baryonic physics. Satellites are quenched following the delayed-then-rapid model, and they are tidally disrupted once their subhalo has lost a significant fraction of its mass. The model is constrained with observed data extending out to high redshift. The empirical relations are very flexible, and the model complexity is increased only if required by the data, assessed by several model selection statistics. We find that for the same final halo mass galaxies can have very different star formation histories. Galaxies that are quenched at z = 0 typically have a higher peak star formation rate compared to their star-forming counterparts. EMERGE predicts stellar-to-halo mass ratios for individual galaxies and introduces scatter self-consistently. We find that at fixed halo mass, passive galaxies have a higher stellar mass on average. The intracluster mass in massive haloes can be up to eight times larger than the mass of the central galaxy. Clustering for star-forming and quenched galaxies is in good agreement with observational constraints, indicating a realistic assignment of galaxies to haloes.},

We illustrate this through case studies of four z {\tilde} 1.3 systems based on deep, spatially resolved, 17-band + G102 + G141 Hubble Space Telescope grism spectrophotometry.

The sample{\rsquo}s diversity{\mdash}passive to vigorously star-forming; stellar masses log $\{$M$\}$$_{* }$/$\{$M$\}$$_{⊙ }$ = 10.5 to 11.2{\mdash}enables us to draw spatiotemporal inferences relevant to key areas of parameter space (Milky Way- to super-M31-mass progenitors). Specifically, we find signs that bulge mass fractions (B/T) and SF history shapes/spatial uniformity are linked, such that higher B/Ts correlate with {\ldquo}inside-out growth{\rdquo} and central specific SFRs that peaked above the global average for all star-forming galaxies at that epoch. Conversely, the system with the lowest B/T had a flat, spatially uniform SFH with normal peak activity. Both findings are consistent with models positing a feedback-driven connection between bulge formation and the switch from rising to falling SFRs ({\ldquo}quenching{\rdquo}). While sample size forces this conclusion to remain tentative, this work provides a proof-of-concept for future efforts to refine or refute it: JWST, WFIRST, and the 30 m class telescopes will routinely produce data amenable to this and more sophisticated analyses. Such samples spanning representative mass, redshift, SFR, and environmental regimes will be ripe for converting into thousands of subgalactic-scale empirical windows on what individual systems actually looked like in the past, ushering in a new dialogue between observation and theory.

  abstract      = {Popular cosmological scenarios predict that galaxies form hierarchically from the merger of many progenitors, each with their own unique star formation history (SFH). We use a sophisticated approach to constrain the SFHs of 4517 blue (presumably star-forming) galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the range 0.2 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1.4 from the All-Wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey. This consists in the Bayesian analysis of the observed galaxy spectral energy distributions with a comprehensive library of synthetic spectra assembled using realistic, hierarchical star formation, and chemical enrichment histories from cosmological simulations. We constrain the SFH of each galaxy in our sample by comparing the observed fluxes in the B, R, I, and K$_{s}$ bands and rest-frame optical emission-line luminosities with those of one million model spectral energy distributions. We explore the dependence of the resulting SFHs on galaxy stellar mass and redshift. We find that the average SFHs of high-mass galaxies rise and fall in a roughly symmetric bell-shaped manner, while those of low-mass galaxies rise progressively in time, consistent with the typically stronger activity of star formation in low-mass compared to high-mass galaxies. For galaxies of all masses, the star formation activity rises more rapidly at high than at low redshift. These findings imply that the standard approximation of exponentially declining SFHs widely used to interpret observed galaxy spectral energy distributions may not be appropriate to constrain the physical parameters of star-forming galaxies at intermediate redshifts.},

  abstract      = {Although there has been much progress in understanding how galaxies evolve, we still do not understand how and when they stop forming stars and become quiescent. We address this by applying our galaxy spectral energy distribution models, which incorporate physically motivated star formation histories (SFHs) from cosmological simulations, to a sample of quiescent galaxies at 0.2$\backslash$lt z$\backslash$lt 2.1. A total of 845 quiescent galaxies with multi-band photometry spanning rest-frame ultraviolet through near-infrared wavelengths are selected from the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) data set. We compute median SFHs of these galaxies in bins of stellar mass and redshift. At all redshifts and stellar masses, the median SFHs rise, reach a peak, and then decline to reach quiescence. At high redshift, we find that the rise and decline are fast, as expected, because the universe is young. At low redshift, the duration of these phases depends strongly on stellar mass. Low-mass galaxies ($\{$log$\}$($\{$M$\}$$_{* }$/$\{$M$\}$$_{⊙ }$){\tilde} 9.5) grow on average slowly, take a long time to reach their peak of star formation ({\gsim} 4 Gyr), and then the declining phase is fast ({\lsim} 2 Gyr). Conversely, high-mass galaxies ($\{$log$\}$($\{$M$\}$$_{* }$/$\{$M$\}$$_{⊙ }$){\tilde} 11) grow on average fast ({\lsim} 2 Gyr), and, after reaching their peak, decrease the star formation slowly ({\gsim} 3). These findings are consistent with galaxy stellar mass being a driving factor in determining how evolved galaxies are, with high-mass galaxies being the most evolved at any time (I.e., downsizing). The different durations we observe in the declining phases also suggest that low- and high-mass galaxies experience different quenching mechanisms, which operate on different timescales.},

The G ALACTICUS model was designed to be highly modular to facilitate expansion and the exploration of alternative descriptions of key physical ingredients. We detail the G ALACTICUS engine for evolving galaxies through a merging hierarchy of dark matter halos and give details of the specific implementations of physics currently available in G ALACTICUS. Finally, we show results from an example model that is in reasonably good agreement with several observational datasets. We use this model to explore numerical convergence and to demonstrate the types of information which can be extracted from G ALACTICUS.},

  abstract      = {Lambda Cold Dark Matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) is now the standard theory of structure formation in the universe. We present the first results from the new Bolshoi dissipationless cosmological {$\Lambda$}CDM simulation that uses cosmological parameters favored by current observations. The Bolshoi simulation was run in a volume 250 h $^{-1}$ Mpc on a side using \~{}8 billion particles with mass and force resolution adequate to follow subhalos down to the completeness limit of V $_{circ}$ = 50 km s$^{-1}$ maximum circular velocity. Using merger trees derived from analysis of 180 stored time steps we find the circular velocities of satellites before they fall into their host halos. Using excellent statistics of halos and subhalos (\~{}10 million at every moment and \~{}50 million over the whole history) we present accurate approximations for statistics such as the halo mass function, the concentrations for distinct halos and subhalos, the abundance of halos as a function of their circular velocity, and the abundance and the spatial distribution of subhalos. We find that at high redshifts the concentration falls to a minimum value of about 4.0 and then rises for higher values of halo mass{\mdash}a new result. We present approximations for the velocity and mass functions of distinct halos as a function of redshift. We find that while the Sheth-Tormen (ST) approximation for the mass function of halos found by spherical overdensity is quite accurate at low redshifts, the ST formula overpredicts the abundance of halos by nearly an order of magnitude by z = 10. We find that the number of subhalos scales with the circular velocity of the host halo as V $^{1/2}$ $_{host}$, and that subhalos have nearly the same radial distribution as dark matter particles at radii 0.3-2 times the host halo virial radius. The subhalo velocity function N($\gt$ V $_{sub}$) scales as V $^{-3}$ $_{circ}$. Combining the results of Bolshoi and Via Lactea-II simulations, we find that inside the virial radius of halos with $\{$V\_circ$\}$=200 $\{$$\backslash$,km s\^{}$\{$-1$\}$$\}$ the number of satellites is N($\gt$ V $_{sub}$) = (V $_{sub}$/58 km s$^{-1}$)$^{-3}$ for satellite circular velocities in the range 4 km s$^{-1}$ $\lt$ V $_{sub}$ $\lt$ 150 km s$^{-1}$.},

We compare the three models and their conformity with observational data for a selection of fundamental properties of galaxies like stellar mass function, star formation rate, cold gas fractions, and metallicities - noting that they sometimes perform differently reflecting model designs and calibrations. We have further selected galaxy subsamples of the catalogues by number densities in stellar mass, cold gas mass, and star formation rate in order to study the clustering statistics of galaxies. We show that despite different treatment of orphan galaxies, i.e. galaxies that lost their dark-matter host halo due to the finite-mass resolution of the N-body simulation or tidal stripping, the clustering signal is comparable, and reproduces the observations in all three models - in particular when selecting samples based upon stellar mass. Our catalogues provide a powerful tool to study galaxy formation within a volume comparable to those probed by ongoing and future photometric and redshift surveys. All model data consisting of a range of galaxy properties - including broad-band SDSS magnitudes - are publicly available.},

  abstract      = {The galaxy stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) is nearly time-independent for $z \lt 4$. We therefore construct a time-independent SHMR model for central galaxies, wherein the in-situ star formation rate (SFR) is determined by the halo mass accretion rate (MAR), which we call Stellar-Halo Accretion Rate Coevolution (SHARC). We show that the $\sim0.3$ dex dispersion of the halo MAR matches the observed dispersion of the SFR on the star-formation main sequence (MS). In the context of ``bathtub''-type models of galaxy formation, SHARC leads to mass-dependent constraints on the relation between SFR and MAR. Despite its simplicity and the simplified treatment of mass growth from mergers, the SHARC model is likely to be a good approximation for central galaxies with $M\_*=10^9- 10^{10.5}M\_\odot$ that are on the MS, representing most of the star formation in the Universe. SHARC predictions agree with observed SFRs for galaxies on the MS at low redshifts, agree fairly well at $z\sim4$, but exceed observations at $z\gt4$. Assuming that the interstellar gas mass is constant for each galaxy (the ``equilibrium condition'' in bathtub models), the SHARC model allows calculation of net mass loading factors for inflowing and outflowing gas. With assumptions about preventive feedback based on simulations, SHARC allows calculation of galaxy metallicity evolution. If galaxy SFRs indeed track halo MARs, especially at low redshifts, that may help explain the success of models linking galaxy properties to halos (including age-matching) and the similarities between two-halo galaxy conformity and halo mass accretion conformity.},

  abstract = {We analyze the halo occupation distribution (HOD) and two-point correlation function of galaxy-size dark matter halos using high-resolution dissipationless simulations of the concordance flat {$\Lambda$}CDM model. The halo samples include both the host halos and the ``subhalos,'' distinct gravitationally bound halos within the virialized regions of larger host systems. We find that the HOD, the probability distribution for a halo of mass M to host a number of subhalos N, is similar to that found in semianalytic and N-body+gasdynamics studies. Its first moment, $\lt$N$\gt$$_{M}$, has a complicated shape consisting of a step, a shoulder, and a power-law high-mass tail. The HOD can be described by Poisson statistics at high halo masses but becomes sub-Poisson for $\lt$N$\gt$$_{M}$$\lt$\~{}4. We show that the HOD can be understood as a combination of the probability for a halo of mass M to host a central galaxy and the probability to host a given number N$_{s}$ of satellite galaxies. The former can be approximated by a steplike function, while the latter can be well approximated by a Poisson distribution, fully specified by its first moment. The first moment of the satellite HOD can be well described by a simple power law $\lt$N$_{s}$$\gt$\~{}M$^{β}$ with {$\beta$}\~{}1 for a wide range of number densities, redshifts, and different power spectrum normalizations. This formulation provides a simple but accurate model for the halo occupation distribution found in simulations. At z=0, the two-point correlation function (CF) of galactic halos can be well fitted by a power law down to \~{}100 h$^{-1}$ kpc with an amplitude and slope similar to those of observed galaxies. The dependence of correlation amplitude on the number density of objects is in general agreement with results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. At redshifts z$\gt$\~{}1, we find significant departures from the power-law shape of the CF at small scales, where the CF steepens because of a more pronounced one-halo component. The departures from the power law may thus be easier to detect in high-redshift galaxy surveys than at the present-day epoch. They can be used to put useful constraints on the environments and formation of galaxies. If the deviations are as strong as indicated by our results, the assumption of the single power law often used in observational analyses of high-redshift clustering is dangerous and is likely to bias the estimates of the correlation length and slope of the correlation function.},

  abstract      = {Late bloomers are massive ($M\_* \gt 10^{10}\,M\_\odot$) galaxies that formed the majority of their stars within $\sim$2 Gyr of the epoch of observation. Our improved methodology for deriving star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies at redshifts $0.45 \lt z \lt 0.75$ from the Carnegie-Spitzer-IMACS Survey includes confidence intervals that robustly distinguish late bloomers from ``old'' galaxies. We use simulated SFHs to test for ``false positives'' and contamination from old galaxies to demonstrate that the late bloomer population is not an artifact of our template modeling technique. We show that late bloomers account for $\sim$20\% of $z\sim0.6$ galaxies with masses of the modern Milky Way, with a moderate dependence on mass. We take advantage of a 1\% overlap of our sample with HST (CANDELS) imaging to construct a ``gold standard'' catalog of 74 galaxies with high-confidence SFHs, SEDs, basic data, and HST images to facilitate comparison with future studies by others. This small subset suggests that galaxies with both old and young SFHs cover the full range of morphology and environment (excluding rich groups or clusters), albeit with a mild but suggestive correlation with local environment. We begin the investigation of whether late bloomers of sufficient mass and frequency are produced in current-generation $\Lambda$CDM-based semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. In terms of halo growth, we find a late-assembling halo fraction within a factor-of-two of our late bloomer fraction. However, sufficiently delaying star formation in such halos may be a challenge for the baryon component of such models.},

  abstract = {Standard star photometry dominated the latter half of the twentieth century reaching its zenith in the 1980s. It was introduced to take advantage of the high sensitivity and large dynamic range of photomultiplier tubes compared to photographic plates. As the quantum efficiency of photodetectors improved and the wavelength range extended further to the red, standard systems were modified and refined, and deviations from the original systems proliferated. The revolutionary shift to area detectors for all optical and IR observations forced further changes to standard systems, and the precision and accuracy of much broad- and intermediate-band photometry suffered until more suitable observational techniques and standard reduction procedures were adopted. But the biggest revolution occurred with the production of all-sky photometric surveys. Hipparcos/Tycho was space based, but most, like 2MASS, were ground-based, dedicated survey telescopes. It is very likely that in the future, rather than making a measurement of an object in some standard photometric system, one will simply look up the magnitudes and colors of most objects in catalogs accessed from the Virtual Observatory. In this review the history of standard star photometry will be outlined, and the calibration and realization of standard systems will be examined. Finally, model atmosphere fluxes are now very realistic, and synthetic photometry offers the best prospects for calibrating all photometric systems. Synthetic photometry from observed spectrophotometry should also be used as a matter of course to provide colors within standard systems and to gain insights into the spectra and colors of unusual stars, star clusters and distant galaxies.},

  abstract      = {Local Group (LG) galaxies have relatively accurate SFHs and metallicity evolution derived from resolved CMD modeling, and thus offer a unique opportunity to explore the efficacy of estimating stellar mass M$\_{\star}$ of real galaxies based on integrated stellar luminosities. Building on the SFHs and metallicity evolution of 40 LG dwarf galaxies, we carried out a comprehensive study of the influence of SFHs, metallicity evolution, and dust extinction on the UV-to-NIR color-$M/L$ (color-log$\Upsilon\_{\star}$($\lambda$)) relations and M$\_{\star}$ estimation of local universe galaxies. We find that: The LG galaxies follow color-log$\Upsilon\_{\star}$($\lambda$) relations that fall in between the ones calibrated by previous studies; Optical color-log$\Upsilon\_{\star}$($\lambda$) relations at higher metallicities ([M/H]) are generally broader and steeper; The SFH ``concentration'' does not significantly affect the color-log$\Upsilon\_{\star}$($\lambda$) relations; Light-weighted ages and [M/H] together constrain log$\Upsilon\_{\star}$($\lambda$) with uncertainties ranging from $\lesssim$ 0.1 dex for the NIR up to 0.2 dex for the optical passbands; Metallicity evolution induces significant uncertainties to the optical but not NIR $\Upsilon\_{\star}$($\lambda$) at given light-weighted ages and [M/H]; The $V$ band is the ideal luminance passband for estimating $\Upsilon\_{\star}$($\lambda$) from single colors, because the combinations of $\Upsilon\_{\star}$($V$) and optical colors such as $B-V$ and $g-r$ exhibit the weakest systematic dependence on SFHs, [M/H] and dust extinction; Without any prior assumption on SFHs, M$\_{\star}$ is constrained with biases $\lesssim$ 0.3 dex by the optical-to-NIR SED fitting. Optical passbands alone constrain M$\_{\star}$ with biases $\lesssim$ 0.4 dex (or $\lesssim$ 0.6 dex) when dust extinction is fixed (or variable) in SED fitting. [abridged]},

One field is located in the LMC bar and the other two are in the outer disk. We find that a significant component of stars older than 4 Gyr is required to match the observed color-magnitude diagrams. Models with a dispersion-free age-metallicity relation are unable to reproduce the width of the observed main sequence; models with a range of metallicity at a given age provide a much better fit. Such models allow us to construct complete ``population boxes'' for the LMC based entirely on color-magnitude diagrams; remarkably, these qualitatively reproduce the age-metallicity relation observed in LMC clusters. We discuss some of the uncertainties in deriving star formation histories by our method and suggest that improvements and confidence in the method will be obtained by independent metallicity determinations. We find, independently of the models, that the LMC bar field has a larger relative component of older stars than the outer fields. The main implications suggested by this study are: (1) The star formation history of field stars appears to differ from the age distribution of clusters. (2) There is no obvious evidence for bursty star formation, but our ability to measure bursts shorter in duration than about 25\% of any given age is limited by the statistics of the observed number of stars. (3) There may be some correlation of the star formation rate with the last close passage of the LMC/SMC/Milky Way, but there is no dramatic effect. (4) the derived star formation history is probably consistent with observed abundances, based on recent chemical evolution models.},

Parameters are estimated in a statistical way by comparing each observed broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) (two GALEX and five SDSS bands) with an extensive library of model galaxy SEDs, which cover a wide range of star formation histories and include stochastic starbursts. We compare the constraints derived using SDSS bands only with those derived using the combination of SDSS and GALEX photometry. We find that the addition of the GALEX bands leads to significant improvement in the estimation of both the dust optical depth and the star formation rate over timescales of 100 Myr to 1 Gyr in a galaxy. We attain sensitivity to SFRs as low as 10$^{-3}$ M$_{solar}$ yr$^{-1}$, and we find that low levels of star formation (SF) are mostly associated with early-type, red galaxies. The least massive galaxies have ratios of current to past-averaged SF rates (b-parameter) consistent with constant SF over a Hubble time. For late-type galaxies, this ratio on average decreases with mass. We find that b correlates tightly with NUV-r color, implying that the SF history of a galaxy can be constrained on the basis of the NUV-r color alone. The fraction of galaxies that have undergone a significant starburst episode within the last 1 Gyr steeply declines with mass, from \~{}20\% for galaxies with \~{}10$^{8}$ M$_{solar}$ to \~{}5\% for \~{}10$^{11}$ M$_{solar}$ galaxies.},

The SFHs of resolved dwarf galaxies of all morphological types, obtained from the application of the synthetic CMD method, are reviewed and discussed. In short: 1) Only early-type galaxies show evidence of long interruptions in the SF activity; late-type dwarfs present rather continuous, or gasping, SF regimes; 2) A few early-type dwarfs have experienced only one episode of SF activity concentrated at the earliest epochs, whilst many others show extended or recurrent SF activity; 3) No galaxy experiencing now its first SF episode has been found yet; 4) No frequent evidence of strong SF bursts is found; 5) There is no significant difference in the SFH of dwarf irregulars and blue compact dwarfs, except for the current SF rates.

It accurately recovers traditional SED parameters, including M $_{*}$, SFR, and dust attenuation, and reveals previously inaccessible information about the number and duration of star formation episodes and the timing of stellar mass assembly, as well as uncertainties in these quantities. This is done using basis star formation histories (SFHs) chosen by comparing the goodness-of-fit of mock galaxy SEDs to the goodness-of-reconstruction of their SFHs. We train and validate the method using a sample of realistic SFHs at z = 1 drawn from stochastic realizations, semi-analytic models, and a cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulation. The method is then applied to a sample of 1100 CANDELS GOODS-S galaxies at 1$\lt$ z$\lt$ 1.5 to illustrate its capabilities at moderate S/N with 15 photometric bands. Of the six parametrizations of SFHs considered, we adopt linear-exponential, bessel-exponential, log-normal, and Gaussian SFHs, and reject the traditional parametrizations of constant (Top-Hat) and exponential SFHs. We quantify the bias and scatter of each parametrization. 15\% of galaxies in our CANDELS sample exhibit multiple episodes of star formation, with this fraction decreasing above $\{$M$\}$$_{* }$$\gt$ $\{$10$\}$$^{9.5}$ $\{$M$\}$$_{⊙ }$. About 40\% of the CANDELS galaxies have SFHs whose maximum occurs at or near the epoch of observation. The dense basis method is scalable and offers a general approach to a broad class of data-science problems.},
