  abstract = {Blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies are metal-poor systems going through a major starburst that cannot last for long. We have identified galaxies which may be BCDs during quiescence (QBCD), i.e., before the characteristic starburst sets in or when it has faded away. These QBCD galaxies are assumed to be like the BCD host galaxies. The SDSS DR6 database provides ~21,500 QBCD candidates. We also select from SDSS DR6 a complete sample of BCD galaxies to serve as reference. The properties of these two galaxy sets have been computed and compared. The QBCD candidates are 30 times more abundant than the BCDs, with their luminosity functions being very similar except for the scaling factor and the expected luminosity dimming associated with the end of the starburst. QBCDs are redder than BCDs, and they have larger H II region-based oxygen abundance. QBCDs also have lower surface brightness. The BCD candidates turn out to be the QBCD candidates with the largest specific star formation rate (actually, with the largest Hα equivalent width). One out of every three dwarf galaxies in the local universe may be a QBCD. The properties of the selected BCDs and QBCDs are consistent with a single sequence in galactic evolution, which the quiescent phase lasting 30 times longer than the starburst phase. The resulting time-averaged star formation rate is low enough to allow this cadence of BCD-QBCD phases during the Hubble time.},

We explore this technique using a combination of optical photometry from CFHTLS and Hubble Space Telescope , infrared photometry from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer satellite, and spectroscopic or photometric redshifts from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey or COSMOS. We present a variety of methods for testing the success of our selection and present methods for optimization given a set of rest-frame color and redshift requirements. We have tested this selection in two different regions of the sky, the COSMOS and Extended Groth Strip (EGS) fields, to reduce the effect of cosmic/sample variance. We have used these methods to assemble large samples of LRGs for two different ancillary programs as a part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-III/Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. This technique is now being used to select ∼600,000 LRG targets for SDSS-IV/Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, which began observations in Fall 2014, and will be adapted for the proposed Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey. We have found that these methods can select high-redshift LRGs efficiently with minimal stellar contamination; this is extremely difficult to achieve with selections that rely on optical photometry alone.},

  title       = {Ly$α$ profile, dust, and prediction of Ly$α$ escape fraction in Green Pea Galaxies},
  abstract    = {We studied Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) escape in a statistical sample of 43 Green Peas with HST/COS Ly$\alpha$ spectra. Green Peas are nearby star-forming galaxies with strong [OIII]$\lambda$5007 emission lines. Our sample is four times larger than the previous sample and covers a much more complete range of Green Pea properties. We found that about 2/3 of Green Peas are strong Ly$\alpha$ line emitters with rest-frame Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width $>20$ \AA. The Ly$\alpha$ profiles of Green Peas are diverse. The Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction, defined as the ratio of observed Ly$\alpha$ flux to intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ flux, shows anti-correlations with a few Ly$\alpha$ kinematic features -- both the blue peak and red peak velocities, the peak separations, and FWHM of the red portion of the Ly$\alpha$ profile. Using properties measured from SDSS optical spectra, we found many correlations -- Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction generally increases at lower dust reddening, lower metallicity, lower stellar mass, and higher [OIII]/[OII] ratio. We fit their Ly$\alpha$ profiles with the HI shell radiative transfer model and found Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction anti-correlates with the best-fit $N_{HI}$. Finally, we fit an empirical linear relation to predict Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction from the dust extinction and Ly$\alpha$ red peak velocity. The standard deviation of this relation is about 0.3 dex. This relation can be used to isolate the effect of IGM scatterings from Ly$\alpha$ escape and to probe the IGM optical depth along the line of sight of each $z>7$ Ly$\alpha$ emission line galaxy in the JWST era.},

  title       = {Blueberry galaxies: the lowest mass young starbursts},
  abstract    = {Searching for extreme emission line galaxies allows us to find low-mass metal-poor galaxies that are good analogs of high redshift Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies. These low-mass extreme emission line galaxies are also potential Lyman-continuum leakers. Finding them at very low redshifts ($z\lesssim0.05$) allows us to be sensitive to even lower stellar masses and metallicities. We report on a sample of extreme emission line galaxies at $z\lesssim0.05$ (blueberry galaxies). We selected them from SDSS broadband images on the basis of their broad band colors, and studied their properties with MMT spectroscopy. From the whole SDSS DR12 photometric catalog, we found 51 photometric candidates. We spectroscopically confirm 40 as blueberry galaxies. (An additional 7 candidates are contaminants, and 4 remain without spectra.) These blueberries are dwarf starburst galaxies with very small sizes ($< 1\hbox{kpc}$), and very high ionization ([OIII]/[OII]$\sim10-60$). They also have some of the lowest stellar masses ($\log(\hbox{M}/\hbox{M}_{\odot})\sim6.5-7.5$) and lowest metallicities ($7.1<12+\log(\hbox{O/H})<7.8$) starburst galaxies. Thus they are small counterparts to green peas and high redshift Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies.},

  abstract = {We present B , R , and Hα images for a total of 114 nearby galaxies ( v helio < 4000 km s -1 ) that, with exception of nine objects, are classified as blue compact dwarfs (BCDs). BR integrated magnitudes, Hα fluxes and Hα equivalent widths for all the objects in the sample are presented. A new set of quantitative, observational criteria for a galaxy to be classified as a BCD is proposed. These criteria include a limit on the K -band luminosity (i.e., stellar mass; M K > -21 mag), peak surface brightness (μ B ,peak < 22 mag arcsec -2 ), and color at the peak surface brightness (μ B ,peak - μ R ,peak ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 1). Hα emission is detected in all but three sample galaxies. Typical color, absolute magnitude, and Hα luminosity are ( B - R ) = 0.7 ± 0.3 mag, M B = -16.1 ± 1.4 mag, and log ( L Hα ) = 40.0 ± 0.6 (ergs s -1 ). Galaxies morphologically classified as nE and iE BCDs within our sample show lower Hα equivalent widths and redder colors, on average, than the iI- and i0-type BCDs. For most of the galaxies the presence of an evolved stellar population is required to explain their observed properties; only the most metal-poor BCDs (e.g., I Zw 18, Tol 65) are still compatible with a pure, young burst. The flux-calibrated and WCS-compliant images in this Atlas are individually available through the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) image server and collectively through a dedicated Web page.},

  abstract      = {We study the relative fraction of low and high surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs and HSBGs) at void walls in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7. We focus on galaxies in equal local density environments. We assume that the host dark matter halo mass (for which we use SDSS group masses) is a good indicator of local density. This analysis allows us to examine the behaviour of the abundance of LSBGs and HSBGs at a fixed local density and distinguish the large-scale environment defined by the void geometry. We compare galaxies in the field and in the void walls; the latter are defined as the volume of void shells of radius equal to that of the void. We find a significant decrement, a factor of {\tilde}4, of the relative fraction of blue, active star-forming LSBGs in equal-mass groups at the void walls and the field. This decrement is consistent with an increase of the fraction of blue, active star-forming HSBGs. In contrast, red LSBGs and HSBGs show negligible changes. We argue that these results are consistent with a scenario where LSBGs with blue colours and strong star formation activity at the void walls are fuelled by gas from the expanding void regions. This process could lead to LSBG to HSBG transformations.},

After two years of commissioning beginning in 2009, the telescope, instruments, software systems and operations are nearly ready to begin the main science survey. Through a spectral survey of millions of objects in much of the northern sky, LAMOST will enable research in a number of contemporary cutting edge topics in astrophysics, such as discovery of the first generation stars in the Galaxy, pinning down the formation and evolution history of galaxies {\mdash} especially the Milky Way and its central massive black hole, and looking for signatures of the distribution of dark matter and possible sub-structures in the Milky Way halo. To maximize the scientific potential of the facility, wide national participation and international collaboration have been emphasized. The survey has two major components: the LAMOST ExtraGAlactic Survey (LEGAS) and the LAMOST Experiment for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (LEGUE). Until LAMOST reaches its full capability, the LEGUE portion of the survey will use the available observing time, starting in 2012. An overview of the LAMOST project and the survey that will be carried out in the next five to six years is presented in this paper. The science plan for the whole LEGUE survey, instrumental specifications, site conditions, and the descriptions of the current on-going pilot survey, including its footprints and target selection algorithm, will be presented as separate papers in this volume.},

  abstract      = {The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer ( WISE ) satellite observed the full sky in four mid-infrared bands in the 2.8-28 μ m range. The primary mission was completed in 2010. The WISE team has done a superb job of producing a series of high-quality, well-documented, complete data releases in a timely manner. However, the "Atlas Image" coadds that are part of the recent AllWISE and previous data releases were intentionally blurred. Convolving the images by the point-spread function while coadding results in "matched-filtered" images that are close to optimal for detecting isolated point sources. But these matched-filtered images are sub-optimal or inappropriate for other purposes. For example, we are photometering the WISE images at the locations of sources detected in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey through forward modeling, and this blurring decreases the available signal-to-noise by effectively broadening the point-spread function. This paper presents a new set of coadds of the WISE images that have not been blurred. These images retain the intrinsic resolution of the data and are appropriate for photometry preserving the available signal-to-noise. Users should be cautioned, however, that the W 3- and W 4-band coadds contain artifacts around large, bright structures (large galaxies, dusty nebulae, etc.); eliminating these artifacts is the subject of ongoing work. These new coadds, and the code used to produce them, are publicly available at http://unwise.me [http://unwise.me] .},

  abstract      = {We present photometry of images from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer ( WISE ) of over 400 million sources detected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We use a “forced photometry” technique, using measured SDSS source positions, star–galaxy classification, and galaxy profiles to define the sources whose fluxes are to be measured in the WISE images. We perform photometry with The Tractor image modeling code, working on our “unWISE” coaddds and taking account of the WISE point-spread function and a noise model. The result is a measurement of the flux of each SDSS source in each WISE band. Many sources have little flux in the WISE bands, so often the measurements we report are consistent with zero given our uncertainties. However, for many sources we get 3 σ or 4 σ measurements; these sources would not be reported by the “official” WISE pipeline and will not appear in the WISE catalog, yet they can be highly informative for some scientific questions. In addition, these small-signal measurements can be used in stacking analyses at the catalog level. The forced photometry approach has the advantage that we measure a consistent set of sources between SDSS and WISE , taking advantage of the resolution and depth of the SDSS images to interpret the WISE images; objects that are resolved in SDSS but blended together in WISE still have accurate measurements in our photometry. Our results, and the code used to produce them, are publicly available at http://unwise.me [http://unwise.me] .},
