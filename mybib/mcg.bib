These relations have been fully in place since ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/840/1/47/apjaa6b05ieqn3.gif] {$z\sim 3$} and have exhibited almost constant slope and scatter since that time. For SFGs, the zero points in ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/840/1/47/apjaa6b05ieqn4.gif] {${{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{{\rm{e}}}$}  and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/840/1/47/apjaa6b05ieqn5.gif] {${{\rm{\Sigma }}}_{1}$} decline by only ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/840/1/47/apjaa6b05ieqn6.gif] {$\times 2$} . This fact plus the narrowness of the relations suggests that galaxies could evolve roughly along the scaling relations. Quiescent galaxies follow different scaling relations that are offset to higher densities at the same mass and redshift. Furthermore, the zero point of their core density has declined by only ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/840/1/47/apjaa6b05ieqn7.gif] {$\times 2$} since ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/840/1/47/apjaa6b05ieqn8.gif] {$z\sim 3$} , while the zero point of the effective density declines by ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/840/1/47/apjaa6b05ieqn9.gif] {$\times 10$} . When galaxies quench, they move from the star-forming relations to the quiescent relations. This involves an increase in the core and effective densities, which suggests that SFGs could experience a phase of significant core growth relative to the average evolution along the structural relations. The distribution of massive galaxies relative to the SFR– M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/840/1/47/apjaa6b05ieqn10.gif] {${}_{\star }$} and the quiescent ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/840/1/47/apjaa6b05ieqn11.gif] {${\rm{\Sigma }}\mbox{--}{M}_{\star }$} relations exhibits an L-shape that is independent of redshift. The knee of this relation consists of a subset of “compact” SFGs that are the most likely precursors of quiescent galaxies forming at later times.

  abstract = {We present a simple theoretical framework for massive galaxies at high redshift, where the main assembly and star formation occurred, and report on the first cosmological simulations that reveal clumpy disks consistent with our analysis. The evolution is governed by the interplay between smooth and clumpy cold streams, disk instability, and bulge formation. Intense, relatively smooth streams maintain an unstable dense gas-rich disk. Instability with high turbulence and giant clumps, each a few percent of the disk mass, is self-regulated by gravitational interactions within the disk. The clumps migrate into a bulge in ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 10 dynamical times, or ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 0.5 Gyr. The cosmological streams replenish the draining disk and prolong the clumpy phase to several Gigayears in a steady state , with comparable masses in disk, bulge, and dark matter within the disk radius. The clumps form stars in dense subclumps following the overall accretion rate, ~100 M ☉ yr –1 , and each clump converts into stars in ~0.5 Gyr. While the clumps coalesce dissipatively to a compact bulge, the star-forming disk is extended because the incoming streams keep the outer disk dense and susceptible to instability and because of angular momentum transport. Passive spheroid-dominated galaxies form when the streams are more clumpy: the external clumps merge into a massive bulge and stir up disk turbulence that stabilize the disk and suppress in situ clump and star formation. We predict a bimodality in galaxy type by z ~ 3, involving giant-clump star-forming disks and spheroid-dominated galaxies of suppressed star formation. After z ~ 1, the disks tend to be stabilized by the dominant stellar disks and bulges. Most of the high- z massive disks are likely to end up as today's early-type galaxies.},

All these fields have a wealth of publicly available imaging data sets in addition to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data, which makes it possible to construct the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of objects over a wide wavelength range. In this paper we describe a photometric analysis of the CANDELS and 3D-HST HST imaging and the ancillary imaging data at wavelengths 0.3-8 μm. Objects were selected in the WFC3 near-IR bands, and their SEDs were determined by carefully taking the effects of the point-spread function in each observation into account. A total of 147 distinct imaging data sets were used in the analysis. The photometry is made available in the form of six catalogs: one for each field, as well as a master catalog containing all objects in the entire survey. We also provide derived data products: photometric redshifts, determined with the EAZY code, and stellar population parameters determined with the FAST code. We make all the imaging data that were used in the analysis available, including our reductions of the WFC3 imaging in all five fields. 3D-HST is a spectroscopic survey with the WFC3 and ACS grisms, and the photometric catalogs presented here constitute a necessary first step in the analysis of these grism data.

Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected, each with extensive ancillary data.

The CANDELS/Deep survey (5σ point-source limit H = 27.7 mag) covers ~125 arcmin 2 within Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS)-N and GOODS-S. The CANDELS/Wide survey includes GOODS and three additional fields (Extended Groth Strip, COSMOS, and Ultra-deep Survey) and covers the full area to a 5σ point-source limit of H ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 27.0 mag. Together with the Hubble Ultra Deep Fields, the strategy creates a three-tiered "wedding-cake" approach that has proven efficient for extragalactic surveys. Data from the survey are nonproprietary and are useful for a wide variety of science investigations. In this paper, we describe the basic motivations for the survey, the CANDELS team science goals and the resulting observational requirements, the field selection and geometry, and the observing design.

The CANDELS/Deep survey covers ~125 arcmin 2 within GOODS-N and GOODS-S, while the remainder consists of the CANDELS/Wide survey, achieving a total of ~800 arcmin 2 across GOODS and three additional fields (Extended Groth Strip, COSMOS, and Ultra-Deep Survey). We summarize the observational aspects of the survey as motivated by the scientific goals and present a detailed description of the data reduction procedures and products from the survey. Our data reduction methods utilize the most up-to-date calibration files and image combination procedures. We have paid special attention to correcting a range of instrumental effects, including charge transfer efficiency degradation for ACS, removal of electronic bias-striping present in ACS data after Servicing Mission 4, and persistence effects and other artifacts in WFC3/IR. For each field, we release mosaics for individual epochs and eventual mosaics containing data from all epochs combined, to facilitate photometric variability studies and the deepest possible photometry.

We find the sizes of our p VJL galaxies are on average three to four times smaller than those of local early-type galaxies (ETGs) with analogous stellar mass.

Low Sérsic index and axis ratio, with median values n ~1.5 and b / a ~ 0.65, respectively, indicate that most of the p VJL galaxies are disk-dominated. Despite large uncertainty, the inner region of the median mass profile of our p VJL galaxies is similar to those of QGs at 0.5 < z < 2.5 and local ETGs. It indicates that local massive ETGs have been formed according to an inside-out scenario: the compact galaxies at high redshift make up the cores of local massive ETGs and then build up the outskirts according to dissipationless minor mergers.},

Little is known about how they formed, but their evolved, dense stellar populations suggest formation within intense, compact starbursts 1-2 Gyr earlier (at 3 < z < 6). Simulations show that gas-rich major mergers can give rise to such starbursts, which produce dense remnants. Submillimeter-selected galaxies (SMGs) are prime examples of intense, gas-rich starbursts. With a new, representative spectroscopic sample of compact, quiescent galaxies at z = 2 and a statistically well-understood sample of SMGs, we show that z = 3-6 SMGs are consistent with being the progenitors of z = 2 quiescent galaxies, matching their formation redshifts and their distributions of sizes, stellar masses, and internal velocities. Assuming an evolutionary connection, their space densities also match if the mean duty cycle of SMG starbursts is ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/782/2/68/apj488224ieqn1.gif] {$42^{+40}_{-29}$} Myr (consistent with independent estimates), which indicates that the bulk of stars in these massive galaxies were formed in a major, early surge of star formation. These results suggest a coherent picture of the formation history of the most massive galaxies in the universe, from their initial burst of violent star formation through their appearance as high stellar-density galaxy cores and to their ultimate fate as giant ellipticals.},

We find that the ALESS SMGs have median stellar mass ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn2.gif] {${M}_{*}=8.9\pm 0.1\times {10}^{10}\;{M}_{\odot }$} , median SFR ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn3.gif] {$=\;280\pm 70\;{M}_{\odot }\;{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$} , median overall V -band dust attenuation ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn4.gif] {${A}_{V}=1.9\pm 0.2$} mag, median dust mass ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn5.gif] {${M}_{\mathrm{dust}}=(5.6\pm 1.0)\times {10}^{8}\;{M}_{\odot }$} , and median average dust temperature ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn6.gif] {${T}_{\mathrm{dust}}\simeq 40$} K. We find that the average intrinsic SED of the ALESS SMGs resembles that of local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies in the infrared range, but the stellar emission of our average SMG is brighter and bluer, indicating lower dust attenuation, possibly because they are more extended. We explore how the average SEDs vary with different parameters (redshift, sub-millimeter flux, dust attenuation, and total infrared luminosity), and we provide a new set of SMG templates that can be used to interpret other SMG observations. To put the ALESS SMGs into context, we compare their stellar masses and SFRs with those of less actively star-forming galaxies at the same redshifts. We find that at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn7.gif] {$z\simeq 2$} , about half of the SMGs lie above the star-forming main sequence (with SFRs three times larger than normal galaxies of the same stellar mass), while half are consistent with being at the high-mass end of the main sequence. At higher redshifts ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/806/1/110/apj513778ieqn8.gif] {$z\simeq 3.5$} ), the SMGs tend to have higher SFRs and stellar masses, but the fraction of SMGs that lie significantly above the main sequence decreases to less than a third.},

  abstract      = {<BR /> Aims: We aim to test the impact of using variable star-forming histories (SFHs) and the IR luminosity as a constrain on the physical parameters of high redshift dusty star-forming galaxies. We explore in particular the properties (SFHs, ages, timescales) of galaxies depending on their belonging to the ``main sequence'' of star-forming galaxies (MS). <BR /> Methods: We performed spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of the UV-to-NIR and FIR emissions of a moderately large sample of GOODS-Herschel galaxies, for which rich multi-wavelength, optical to IR observations are available. We tested different SFHs and the impact of imposing energy conservation in the SED fitting process, to help with issues like the age-extinction degeneracy and produce SEDs consistent with observations. <BR /> Results: Our simple models produce well constrained SEDs for the broad majority of the sample (84\%), with the notable exception of the very high L$_{IR}$ end, for which we have indications that the energy conservation hypothesis cannot hold true for a single component population approach. We observe trends in the preferences in SFHs among our sources depending on stellar mass M$_{⋆}$ and z. Trends also emerge in the characteristic timescales of the SED models depending on the location on the SFR - M$_{⋆}$ diagram. We show that whilst using the same available observational data, we can produce galaxies less star-forming than classically inferred, if we allow rapidly declining SFHs, while properly reproducing their observables. These sources, representing 7\% of the sample, can be post-starbursts undergoing quenching, and their SFRs are potentially overestimated if inferred from their L$_{IR}$. Based on the trends observed in the rising SFH fits we explore a simple evolution model for stellar mass build-up over the considered time period. <BR /> Conclusions: Our approach successfully breaks the age-extinction degeneracy, and enables to evaluate properly the SFRs of the sources in the SED fitting process. Fitting without the IR constrain leads to a strong preference for declining SFHs, while its inclusion increases the preference of rising SFHs, more so at high z, in tentative agreement with the cosmic star-formation history (CSFH), although this result suffers from poor statistics. Keeping in mind that the sample is biased toward high luminosities and intense star formation, the evolution shaped by our model appears as both bursty (in its early stages) and steady-lasting (later on). The SFH of the sample considered as a whole follows the CSFH with a surprisingly small scatter, and is compatible with other studies supporting that the more massive galaxies have built most of their mass earlier than lower mass galaxies.},

  abstract      = {Using a compilation of 25 studies from the literature, we investigate the evolution of the star-forming galaxy (SFG) main sequence (MS) in stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) out to z ~ 6. After converting all observations to a common set of calibrations, we find a remarkable consensus among MS observations (~0.1 dex 1σ interpublication scatter). By fitting for time evolution of the MS in bins of constant mass, we deconvolve the observed scatter about the MS within each observed redshift bin. After accounting for observed scatter between different SFR indicators, we find the width of the MS distribution is ~0.2 dex and remains constant over cosmic time. Our best fits indicate the slope of the MS is likely time-dependent, with our best-fit log SFR( M * , t ) = (0.84 ± 0.02 – 0.026 ± 0.003 × t )log M * – (6.51 ± 0.24 – 0.11 ± 0.03 × t ), where t is the age of the universe in Gyr. We use our fits to create empirical evolutionary tracks in order to constrain MS galaxy star formation histories (SFHs), finding that (1) the most accurate representations of MS SFHs are given by delayed-τ models, (2) the decline in fractional stellar mass growth for a "typical" MS galaxy today is approximately linear for most of its lifetime, and (3) scatter about the MS can be generated by galaxies evolving along identical evolutionary tracks assuming an initial 1σ spread in formation times of ~1.4 Gyr.},

  abstract  = {Nearby galaxies come in two flavors: red quiescent galaxies (QGs) with old stellar populations, and blue young star-forming galaxies (SFGs). This color bimodality seems to be already in place at z = 2 - 3, presenting also strong correlations with size and morphology. Surprisingly, massive QGs at higher redshifts are \~{}5 times smaller than local, equal mass analogs. In contrast, most of the massive SFGs at these redshifts are still relatively large disks. The strong bimodality in both SFR and sizes indicates that some SFGs must experience strong structural transformations accompanied by a rapid truncation of the star-formation to match the observed properties of QGs. Using high-resolution HST/WFC3 F160W imaging from the CANDELS survey in GOODS-S and UDS, along with multi-wavelength ancillary data, we analyze stellar masses, SFRs and sizes of a sample of massive (M$_{*}$ $\gt$ 10$^{10}$ M $_{⊙}$) galaxies at z = 1.4 - 3.0 to identify a population of compact SFGs with similar structural properties as compact QGs at z\~{}2. We also find that the number density of QGs increases rapidly since z = 3. Among these, the number of compact QGs builds up first, and only at z $\lt$ 1.8 we do start finding a sizable number of extended QGs. This suggests that the bulk of these galaxies are assembled at late times by both continuous migration (quenching) of non-compact SFGs and size growth of cQGs. As a result of this growth, the population of cQGs disappears by z\~{}1. Simultaneously, we identify a population of compact SFGs (cSFGs) whose number density decreases steadily with time since z = 3.0, being almost completely absent at z $\lt$ 1.4. The number of cSFGs makes up less than 20\% of all massive SFGs, but they present similar number densities as cQGs down to z\~{}2, suggesting an evolutionary link between the two populations.},

  abstract      = {We analyze the star-forming and structural properties of 45 massive (log(M/M $_{⊙}$) $\gt$10) compact star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at 2 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3 to explore whether they are progenitors of compact quiescent galaxies at z \~{} 2. The optical/NIR and far-IR Spitzer/Herschel colors indicate that most compact SFGs are heavily obscured. Nearly half (47\%) host an X-ray-bright active galactic nucleus (AGN). In contrast, only about 10\% of other massive galaxies at that time host AGNs. Compact SFGs have centrally concentrated light profiles and spheroidal morphologies similar to quiescent galaxies and are thus strikingly different from other SFGs, which typically are disk-like and sometimes clumpy or irregular. Most compact SFGs lie either within the star formation rate (SFR)-mass main sequence (65\%) or below it (30\%), on the expected evolutionary path toward quiescent galaxies. These results show conclusively that galaxies become more compact before they lose their gas and dust, quenching star formation. Using extensive HST photometry from CANDELS and grism spectroscopy from the 3D-HST survey, we model their stellar populations with either exponentially declining ({$\tau$}) star formation histories (SFHs) or physically motivated SFHs drawn from semianalytic models (SAMs). SAMs predict longer formation timescales and older ages \~{}2 Gyr, which are nearly twice as old as the estimates of the {$\tau$} models. Both models yield good spectral energy distribution fits, indicating that the systematic uncertainty in the age due to degeneracies in the SFH is of that order of magnitude. However, SAM SFHs better match the observed slope and zero point of the SFR-mass main sequence. Contrary to expectations, some low-mass compact SFGs (log(M/M $_{⊙}$) =10-10.6) have younger ages but lower specific SFRs than that of more massive galaxies, suggesting that the low-mass galaxies reach the red sequence faster. If the progenitors of compact SFGs are extended SFGs, state-of-the-art SAMs show that mergers and disk instabilities (DIs) are both able to shrink galaxies, but DIs are more frequent (60\% versus 40\%) and form more concentrated galaxies. We confirm this result via high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations.},

In the IR, these exposure times yield a continuum signal-to-noise ratio of ~5 per resolution element at H 140 ~ 23.1 and a 5σ emission-line sensitivity of ~5 × 10 –17 erg s –1 cm –2 for typical objects, improving by a factor of ~2 for compact sources in images with low sky background levels. The WFC3/G141 spectra provide continuous wavelength coverage from 1.1 to 1.6 μm at a spatial resolution of ~0 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/farcs.gif] {farcs} 13, which, combined with their depth, makes them a unique resource for studying galaxy evolution. We present an overview of the preliminary reduction and analysis of the grism observations, including emission-line and redshift measurements from combined fits to the extracted grism spectra and photometry from ancillary multi-wavelength catalogs. The present analysis yields redshift estimates with a precision of σ( z ) = 0.0034(1 + z ), or σ( v ) ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 1000 km s –1 . We illustrate how the generalized nature of the survey yields near-infrared spectra of remarkable quality for many different types of objects, including a quasar at z = 4.7, quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2, and the most distant T-type brown dwarf star known. The combination of the CANDELS and 3D-HST surveys will provide the definitive imaging and spectroscopic data set for studies of the 1 < z < 3.5 universe until the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope .},
